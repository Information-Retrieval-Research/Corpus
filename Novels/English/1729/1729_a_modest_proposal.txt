               text analysis: satire
                   While Alexander Pope is generally sympathetic to his satirical
                   targets, Swift’s work is darker and more biting. Satire is a
                   literary technique in which people’s behaviors or society’s
                                                                                      How can
                   institutions are ridiculed for the purpose of bringing about
                   social reform. Swift used satire to comment on specific               we fight
                   political and cultural concerns that angered and offended him.
                      One of the satirist’s most reliable tools is verbal irony, in
                   which what is said is the opposite of what is meant. As you

                   seemingly rational proposal.
                                                                                      rapier, using it to slash away at injustice.
                                                                                      Though some may claim the power

                    from being a burden to their parents or country,
                       and for making them beneficial to the public
                                                           Jonathan Swift


                background By 1700, Ireland was so completely dominated by England that it
                seemed like a conquered territory. The Catholic majority could not vote, hold public
                office, buy land, or receive an education. The repressive policies reduced many Irish
                people to poverty. When crops failed—as they did for several years during the 1720s—
                many faced starvation. Jonathan Swift, outraged by the injustice of England’s treatment
                of Ireland, penned “A Modest Proposal,” using ferocious satire to strike back at those
                who neglected Ireland’s poor.




             It is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town1 or travel in                                       Analyze Visuals

                But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the
             children of professed beggars; it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the
             whole number of infants at a certain age who are born of parents in effect as little
             able to support them as those who demand our charity in the streets.
        20      As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this
             important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of other projectors,6
             I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a
             child just dropped from its dam7 may be supported by her milk for a solar year,
             with little other nourishment; at most not above the value of two shillings, which
             the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of
             begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for them in
             such a manner as instead of being a charge upon their parents or the parish, or
             wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, they shall on the contrary
             contribute to the feeding, and partly to the clothing, of many thousands.
        30      There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent
             those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their
             bastard children, alas, too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent babes,
             I doubt,8 more to avoid the expense than the shame, which would move tears and
             pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.
                The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a
             half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple whose           Language Coach
             wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couples who              Synonyms Words with
             are able to maintain their own children, although I apprehend there cannot be so          the same or almost

             many under the present distresses of the kingdom; but this being granted, there will
                                                                                                       synonyms. Which word
        40   remain an hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand          in line 36 is a synonym

             poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, how this number shall be
             reared and provided for, which, as I have already said, under the present situation
             of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can
             neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture; we neither build houses (I mean
             in the country) nor cultivate land. They can very seldom pick up a livelihood by
             stealing till they arrive at six years old, except where they are of towardly parts;9

                    cannot turn to account10 either to the parents or the kingdom, the charge of
                    nutriment and rags having been at least four times that value.
                       I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not
               60   be liable to the least objection.
                       I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in
                    London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious,
                    nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I
                    make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.11
                       I do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration that of the hundred and
                    twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved
                    for breed,12 whereof only one fourth part to be males, which is more than we allow
                    to sheep, black cattle, or swine; and my reason is that these children are seldom
                    the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore
               70   one male will be suff icient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred
                    thousand may at a year old be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune
                    through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in
                    the last month, so as to render them plump and fat for a good table. A child will
                    make two dishes at an entertainment for friends; and when the family dines alone,
                    the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little
                    pepper or salt will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter. c                             c   PROPOSITION
                       I have reckoned upon a medium that a child just born will weigh twelve                                          AND SUPPORT
                                                                                                                                       Reread lines 65–76. What

                       I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords,
               80   who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title
                    to the children.
                       Infant’s f lesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful in
                    March, and a little before and after. For we are told by a grave author, an eminent
                    French physician,13 that f ish being a prolif ic14 diet, there are more children born
                    in Roman Catholic countries about nine months after Lent15 than at any other
                    season; therefore, reckoning a year after Lent, the markets will be more glutted
                    than usual, because the number of popish infants is at least three to one in this
                    kingdom; and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening                                   collateral (kE-lBtPEr-El)

                    our schoolboys, by continual exercise, and their taste disagreeable; and to fatten
                    them would not answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think with
                    humble submission, be a loss to the public, because they soon would become
                    breeders themselves; and besides, it is not improbable that some scrupulous people
              120   might be apt to censure such a practice (although indeed very unjustly) as a little
                    bordering upon cruelty; which, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest
                    objection against any project, how well soever intended. e                                                    e   SATIRE

            f ineries which they never will pay for, the kingdom would not be the worse.
                Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number
            of poor people who are aged, diseased, or maimed, and I have been desired to
            employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous
            an encumbrance. But I am not in the least pain upon that matter, because it is                                    encumbrance
            very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine,                                     (Dn-kOmPbrEns) n.
                                                                                                                              a burden
      140   and f ilth and vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the younger
            laborers, they are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work,                                    famine (fBmPGn) n. a
            and consequently pine away for want of nourishment to a degree that if at any                                     period in which there
                                                                                                                              is a severe shortage

                                                                                                                              of food
            perform it; and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the
            evils to come.
                I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I think the
            advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of
            the highest importance.
                For f irst, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the number of
      150   Papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal breeders of the
            nation as well as our most dangerous enemies; and who stay at home on purpose
            to deliver the kingdom to the Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by
            the absence of so many good Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their
            country than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an
            Episcopal curate.22
                Secondly, the poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, which
            by law may be made liable to distress,23 and help to pay their landlord’s rent, their
            corn and cattle being already seized and money a thing unknown.
                Thirdly, whereas the maintenance of an hundred thousand children, from two
      160   years old and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per
            annum, the nation’s stock will be thereby increased f ifty thousand pounds per
            annum, besides the prof it of a new dish introduced to the tables of all gentlemen
            of fortune in the kingdom who have any ref inement in taste. And the money
            will circulate among ourselves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and
            manufacture. f                                                                                                f   PROPOSITION AND
                Fourthly, the constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per                             SUPPORT
            annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the charge of maintaining them                                Why does Swift supply
                                                                                                                              these cost and profit
            after the first year.
                                                                                                                              calculations?
                Fifthly, this food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where the
      170   vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts24 for dressing
            it to perfection, and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine
            gentlemen, who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and

                       Sixthly, this would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise nations have
                    either encouraged by rewards or enforced by laws and penalties. It would increase
                    the care and tenderness of mothers toward their children, when they were sure of a
                    settlement for life to the poor babes, provided in some sort by the public, to their
                    annual prof it instead of expense. We should see an honest emulation among the
              180   married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the market. Men                                   g PROPOSITION

                    curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women:

                                                                                                     effectiveness of the structure

             3. Clarify Reread lines 222–229. Why does Swift feel that his proposal is               author’s point of view or purpose
                                                                                                     in a text in which the rhetoric is
                superior to others that have been put forward?                                       particularly effective.


        Text Analysis
             4. Examine Verbal Irony What verbal irony does Swift use in each of the
                following parts of “A Modest Proposal”?
                  • the title of the essay
                  • lines 59–60 (“I shall now . . . least objection.”)
                  • lines 135–145 (“Some persons . . . evils to come.”)
              5. Interpret Satire Instead of directly attacking injustice and flawed behavior,
                 Swift uses irony to convey his ideas indirectly. What conclusions would you
                 draw about his attitude toward each of the following?
                  • Irish landlords (lines 79–81)
                  • the way most English and Irish Protestants view Irish Catholics (lines 82–89)
                  • Irish Protestants living abroad (lines 149–155)
             6. Evaluate Proposition and Support Review the chart you created as you read.
                Regardless of your emotional response to the essay, do you consider the
                proposal to be well supported? Explain why or why not.
              7. Compare Texts Recall that on page 609, you learned the difference between
                 Horatian and Juvenalian satire. Compare the tone of The Rape of the Lock with the
                 tone of “A Modest Proposal.” Why is Pope’s poem considered Horatian and Swift’s
                 essay considered Juvenalian? Support your answer with examples from the texts.

        Text Criticism
             8. Historical Context The 18th century is often called the Age of Reason because
                advances in science and technology fueled belief that governments could
                apply rational thought to solve many social problems. Swift, a traditionalist,
                was often skeptical of new ideas. In what ways does “A Modest Proposal”
                reflect this attitude?

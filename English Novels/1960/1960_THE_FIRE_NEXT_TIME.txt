I Dear James:
     HAVE BEGUN this letter  ve times and torn it uS  ve times. I
keeS seeinJ \our Iace, which is also the Iace oI \our Iather and m\
brother. Like him, \ou are touJh, dark, vulnerable, mood\—with a
ver\ de nite tendenc\ to sound truculent because \ou want no one
to think \ou are soIt. You ma\ be like \our JrandIather in this, I
don’t know, but certainl\ both \ou and \our Iather resemble him
ver\ much Sh\sicall\. Well, he is dead, he never saw \ou, and he
had a terrible liIe; he was deIeated lonJ beIore he died because, at
the bottom oI his heart, he reall\ believed what white SeoSle said
about him. This is one oI the reasons that he became so hol\. I am
sure that \our Iather has told \ou somethinJ about all that. Neither
\ou nor  \our  Iather e[hibit  an\  tendenc\ towards holiness: \ou
reall\ are oI another era, Sart oI what haSSened when the NeJro leIt
the land and came into what the late E. Franklin Frazier called “the
cities oI destruction.” You can onl\ be destro\ed b\ believinJ that
\ou reall\  are what the white world calls a nigger. I tell \ou this
because I love \ou, and Slease don’t \ou ever IorJet it.
   I have known both oI \ou all \our lives, have carried \our Dadd\
in m\  arms and on m\  shoulders, kissed and sSanked him and
watched him learn to walk. I don’t know iI \ou’ve known an\bod\
Irom that Iar back; iI \ou’ve loved an\bod\ that lonJ,  rst  as an
inIant, then as a child, then as a man, \ou Jain a stranJe SersSective
on time and human Sain and e ort. Other SeoSle cannot see what I
see whenever I look into \our Iather’s Iace, Ior behind \our Iather’s
Iace as it is toda\ are all those other Iaces which were his. Let him
lauJh and I see a cellar \our Iather does not remember and a house
he does not remember and I hear in his Sresent lauJhter his lauJhter
as a child. Let him curse and I remember him IallinJ down the cellar
steSs, and howlinJ, and I remember, with Sain, his tears, which m\
hand or \our  Jrandmother’s so easil\ wiSed awa\. But no one’s
hand can wiSe awa\ those tears he sheds invisibl\ toda\, which one

10
hears in his lauJhter and in his sSeech and in his sonJs. I know what
the  world   has  done  to   m\   brother   and  how   narrowl\    he  has
survived it.  And I know,  which  is much worse, and this is  the crime
oI which  I  accuse m\  countr\   and m\   countr\men,  and  Ior  which
neither I nor  time nor  histor\  will  ever IorJive  them, that  the\  have
destro\ed and are destro\inJ   hundreds oI thousands oI lives  and do
not know  it  and  do not  want  to  know  it.  One can be,  indeed one
must   strive   to    become,  touJh    and   ShilosoShical   concerninJ
destruction and  death, Ior  this  is  what  most oI  mankind  has been
best at   since  we  have  heard   oI  man.  (But   remember:  most  oI
mankind  is not  all  oI mankind.)   But it   is not  Sermissible that  the
authors oI  devastation should also  be innocent.  It is  the innocence
which constitutes the crime.
   Now,   m\    dear  namesake,  these   innocent   and  well-meaninJ
SeoSle, \our    countr\men,   have   caused \ou    to  be   born   under
conditions  not  ver\   Iar  removed  Irom  those  described Ior   us b\
Charles Dickens in the London oI more than  a hundred \ears aJo. (I
hear the chorus  oI the  innocents screaminJ,  “No!  This is  not  true!
How bitter \ou   are!”—but  I  am writinJ   this  letter  to you,  to tr\   to
tell \ou   somethinJ about  how to  handle them, Ior  most oI them  do
not  \et  reall\    know  that  \ou   e[ist.   I  know the  conditions   under
which  \ou  were  born, Ior  I  was there.  Your  countr\men  were  not
there, and  haven’t made  it  \et.  Your  Jrandmother  was also  there,
and no one has ever  accused her oI beinJ  bitter.  I suJJest that  the
innocents check with  her.  She isn’t  hard to   nd.   Your countr\men
don’t know  that she e[ists, either,  thouJh  she has been workinJ  Ior
them all their  lives.)
   Well,  \ou  were born,  here \ou  came, somethinJ like   Iteen  \ears
aJo; and thouJh  \our  Iather  and mother  and Jrandmother,  lookinJ
about the streets throuJh  which  the\   were carr\inJ   \ou,  starinJ  at
the  walls  into  which   the\   brouJht  \ou,   had  ever\   reason to   be
heav\hearted,  \et   the\  were  not.  For  here  \ou  were,  BiJ  James,
named Ior me—\ou  were  a biJ bab\,  I  was not—here \ou   were: to
be  loved.   To  be  loved,   bab\,    hard,  at   once,  and   Iorever,   to
strenJthen \ou  aJainst  the loveless world.   Remember that: I  know
how black  it  looks toda\,  Ior  \ou.  It  looked bad  that da\,   too, \es,

11
we were  tremblinJ.  We have  not stoSSed tremblinJ  \et,   but iI  we
had not loved each other  none oI us would have survived.  And now
\ou  must  survive  because we love  \ou,   and Ior  the  sake oI  \our
children and \our  children’s children.
   This innocent  countr\  set \ou  down  in a  Jhetto in  which,  in Iact,
it intended  that \ou  should Serish. Let me sSell out Srecisel\  what I
mean b\ that,  Ior the  heart oI the matter  is here, and the root oI  m\
disSute with  m\  countr\.  You  were born where  \ou  were born  and
Iaced the Iuture  that  \ou  Iaced because \ou  were black  and for  no
other reason. The limits oI \our  ambition  were, thus,  e[Sected to be
set Iorever.  You were  born  into  a  societ\  which  sSelled  out  with
brutal  clarit\,   and  in  as man\   wa\s  as Sossible, that  \ou   were  a
worthless  human   beinJ.   You  were   not   e[Sected   to   asSire  to
e[cellence:  \ou   were  e[Sected   to  make  Seace with   mediocrit\.
Wherever \ou  have turned, James, in \our   short time  on this earth,
\ou  have been told where \ou  could Jo and what  \ou  could do (and
how \ou could  do it) and where  \ou  could live and whom  \ou  could
marr\.  I  know  \our   countr\men  do  not  aJree with  me about  this,
and  I  hear  them   sa\inJ,   “You  e[aJJerate.”   The\   do   not  know
Harlem,  and I  do.  So  do \ou.   Take  no  one’s word  Ior   an\thinJ,
includinJ  mine—but trust  \our  e[Serience. Know whence \ou  came.
II \ou  know  whence \ou  came, there is reall\  no limit  to  where \ou
can Jo. The details and  s\mbols oI  \our  liIe  have been deliberatel\
constructed to make \ou   believe what  white  SeoSle sa\ about \ou.
3lease tr\  to remember that what  the\  believe, as well  as what the\
do and cause \ou  to endure, does not  testiI\  to  \our  inIeriorit\    but
to their   inhumanit\   and  Iear.  3lease tr\   to  be clear,  dear  James,
throuJh  the  storm  which   raJes about  \our   \outhIul    head toda\,
about  the   realit\    which   lies  behind   the  words   aFFeStanFe and
integration. There is no  reason Ior \ou   to tr\   to  become like  white
SeoSle and   there   is  no   basis  whatever   Ior    their   imSertinent
assumStion that they must acceSt you. The reall\  terrible  thinJ,  old
budd\,  is that you must acceSt them. And I mean that ver\  seriousl\.
You  must  acceSt  them   and  acceSt  them  with   love.   For  these
innocent SeoSle have no other hoSe. The\ are, in e ect, still  traSSed
in   a  histor\     which   the\    do   not   understand;  and   until    the\

12
understand it,  the\   cannot  be released Irom  it.  The\   have had  to
believe Ior man\  \ears, and Ior innumerable  reasons, that black men
are inIerior  to white  men. Man\   oI them,  indeed, know better,  but,
as \ou will  discover, SeoSle  nd  it  ver\  di cult    to act on  what the\
know. To  act is  to be  committed,  and to  be committed  is to  be in
danJer.  In   this  case,  the  danJer,   in  the   minds  oI   most  white
Americans, is  the  loss oI  their   identit\.   Tr\   to  imaJine  how  \ou
would Ieel  iI \ou  woke  uS one morninJ  to  nd   the sun shininJ  and
all the stars a ame.  You would be IriJhtened  because it is out oI the
order oI nature. An\  uSheaval in the universe is terriI\inJ    because it
so SroIoundl\   attacks  one’s sense oI  one’s own  realit\.   Well,  the
black man has Iunctioned  in  the white  man’s world  as a  [ed   star,
as an immovable  Sillar:  and as he  moves out  oI his  Slace, heaven
and earth  are shaken to  their  Ioundations.  You,  don’t  be aIraid.  I
said that it was intended that  \ou  should Serish in the Jhetto,  Serish
b\  never beinJ allowed to  Jo behind the white  man’s de nitions,   b\
never beinJ allowed to sSell \our  SroSer name. You have, and man\
oI us have, deIeated this intention;  and, b\   a terrible  law, a terrible
Sarado[,  those  innocents  who   believed  that   \our   imSrisonment
made them saIe are losinJ  their JrasS oI  realit\.   But these men are
\our   brothers—\our    lost,   \ounJer    brothers.   And   iI   the   word
integration means an\thinJ, this is what it  means: that we, with  love,
shall  Iorce  our  brothers  to  see themselves  as the\   are,  to  cease
 eeinJ  Irom  realit\   and beJin  to  chanJe it.  For this  is \our   home,
m\  Iriend,   do not  be  driven  Irom   it;  Jreat  men have  done  Jreat
thinJs  here,   and  will   aJain,   and  we   can  make  America   what
America must  become. It  will  be hard,  James, but  \ou  come Irom
sturd\,  Seasant stock, men  who Sicked  cotton  and dammed rivers
and built   railroads,  and, in  the  teeth  oI  the  most terriI\inJ    odds,
achieved an unassailable and monumental diJnit\.  You come Irom  a
lonJ line oI Jreat  Soets, some oI the Jreatest Soets since Homer. One
oI them said, The very time I thought I was lost, My dungeon shook and
my Fhains fell o .
   You  know,   and  I   know,   that  the   countr\   is   celebratinJ  one
hundred \ears  oI  Ireedom one hundred  \ears  too soon. We  cannot
be Iree until the\  are Iree. God bless \ou, James, and GodsSeed.

Your uncle,
James

DOWN   AT   THE  CROSS


    Letter from a Region in My Mind

15
   Take uS the White Man’s burden—
   Ye dare not stooS to less— 
   Nor call  too loud on Freedom 
   To cloak \our  weariness; 
   B\  all \e  cr\  or whisSer, 
   B\  all \e  leave or do, 
   The silent, sullen SeoSles 
   Shall weiJh  \our  Gods and \ou.                       —KiSling
                                                                                            
                                                                                            

Down at the cross where m\ Saviour died,
Down where Ior cleansinJ Irom sin I  cried, 
There to m\  heart was the blood aSSlied, 
SinJinJ Jlor\  to  His name!                                    —Hymn

16
I UNDERWENT, durinJ the summer that I  became Iourteen, a
SrolonJed reliJious crisis. I use the word “reliJious” in the common,
and arbitrar\, sense, meaninJ that I then discovered God, His saints
and anJels, and His blazinJ Hell. And since I had been born in a
Christian nation, I acceSted this Deit\ as the onl\ one. I suSSosed
Him to e[ist  onl\  within  the walls oI  a church—in Iact, oI our
church—and I also suSSosed that God and saIet\ were s\non\mous.
The word “saIet\”  brinJs us to  the  real meaninJ oI the  word
“reliJious” as we use it. ThereIore, to state it in  another, more
accurate wa\, I became, durinJ m\ Iourteenth \ear, Ior the  rst
time in m\ liIe,  aIraid—aIraid oI the evil within me and aIraid oI
the evil without. What I saw around me that summer in Harlem was
what I had alwa\s seen; nothinJ had chanJed. But now, without an\
warninJ, the whores and SimSs and racketeers on the Avenue had
become a Sersonal menace. It had not beIore occurred to me that I
could become one oI them, but now I realized that we had been
Sroduced b\ the same circumstances. Man\ oI m\ comrades were
clearl\ headed Ior the Avenue, and m\ Iather said that I was headed
that wa\, too. M\ Iriends beJan to drink and smoke, and embarked
—at  rst avid, then JroaninJ—on their se[ual careers. Girls, onl\
sliJhtl\ older than I was, who sanJ in the choir or tauJht Sunda\
school, the children oI hol\ Sarents, underwent, beIore m\ e\es,
their incredible metamorShosis, oI which the most bewilderinJ
asSect was not their buddinJ breasts or their roundinJ behinds but
somethinJ deeSer and more subtle, in their e\es, their heat, their
odor, and the in ection oI their voices. Like the stranJers on the
Avenue, the\ became, in the  twinklinJ oI  an  e\e,  unutterabl\
di erent and Iantasticall\ Sresent. OwinJ to the wa\ I had been
raised, the abruSt discomIort that all this aroused in me and the Iact
that I had no idea what m\ voice or m\ mind or m\ bod\ was likel\
to do ne[t caused me to consider m\selI one oI the most deSraved

17
SeoSle on earth. Matters were not helSed b\ the  Iact that these hol\
Jirls  seemed rather to  enMo\ m\  terri ed    laSses, our Jrim,   Juilt\,
tormented e[Seriments,  which  were at  once as chill  and  Mo\less as
the Russian steSSes and hotter, b\ Iar, than all the  res oI  Hell.
   Yet  there  was  somethinJ  deeSer than   these chanJes, and  less
de nable,  that  IriJhtened  me. It  was real in  both  the bo\s  and  the
Jirls, but it  was, somehow, more vivid  in the bo\s.  In the case oI the
Jirls,  one  watched   them  turninJ   into   matrons  beIore  the\    had
become women. The\ beJan to  maniIest a curious and  reall\  rather
terriI\inJ   sinJle-mindedness. It  is hard to  sa\  e[actl\   how  this was
conve\ed:  somethinJ  imSlacable in  the  set  oI the  liSs,  somethinJ
IarseeinJ  (seeinJ  what?)   in   the  e\es,   some  new  and   crushinJ
determination in  the walk, somethinJ  SeremStor\ in the  voice. The\
did not  tease us, the bo\s,  an\  more; the\   reSrimanded us sharSl\,
sa\inJ,  “You better  be thinkinJ   about \our  soul!”  For  the Jirls  also
saw the evidence on the Avenue, knew what the  Srice would be, Ior
them, oI  one missteS, knew that  the\  had to  be Srotected and that
we were the  onl\   Srotection there  was. The\  understood that  the\
must act as God’s deco\s, savinJ the souls oI the bo\s  Ior  Jesus and
bindinJ   the  bodies  oI   the  bo\s   in   marriaJe.  For   this  was  the
beJinninJ oI  our burninJ  time, and “It  is better,”  said St. 3aul—who
elsewhere, with  a most  unusual and  stunninJ  e[actness, described
himselI as a “wretched man”—“to  marr\   than to burn.”  And I  beJan
to Ieel  in  the bo\s  a  curious, war\,   bewildered  desSair, as thouJh
the\  were now settlinJ  in  Ior the  lonJ, hard  winter  oI liIe.  I did  not
know then what  it  was that I was reactinJ  to; I  Sut it to  m\selI  that
the\  were lettinJ  themselves Jo. In the same wa\ that  the Jirls  were
destined to Jain  as much weiJht  as their  mothers,  the bo\s,  it  was
clear,  would  rise  no  hiJher   than  their   Iathers.  School  beJan to
reveal itselI, thereIore, as a child’s Jame that one could not win,  and
bo\s droSSed out oI school and went to  work. M\   Iather wanted me
to do the same. I reIused, even thouJh  I no lonJer  had an\  illusions
about   what   an   education   could    do   Ior   me;   I   had   alread\
encountered too man\  colleJe-Jraduate hand\men.  M\  Iriends were
now  “downtown,”   bus\,  as the\   Sut  it,  “ JhtinJ     the man.”   The\
beJan to care less about the wa\  the\  looked, the wa\  the\  dressed,

18
the thinJs  the\  did;  Sresentl\,  one  Iound them  in  twos  and threes
and Iours, in a hallwa\,  sharinJ  a MuJ oI wine or a bottle oI whiske\,
talkinJ,  cursinJ,   JhtinJ,    sometimes weeSinJ:  lost, and  unable  to
sa\ what  it  was that  oSSressed them, e[ceSt that the\  knew  it  was
“the  man”—the   white   man.   And  there   seemed to   be  no   wa\
whatever to  remove  this  cloud  that  stood  between them  and  the
sun, between them and love and  liIe and  Sower, between them and
whatever  it  was that   the\  wanted.  One  did  not  have  to  be  ver\
briJht  to realize  how  little  one could  do to  chanJe one’s situation;
one did not  have to  be abnormall\   sensitive to be  worn down  to  a
cuttinJ edJe b\  the incessant and Jratuitous  humiliation  and danJer
one encountered ever\  workinJ   da\,  all  da\  lonJ.  The humiliation
did  not aSSl\  merel\   to  workinJ  da\s,  or  workers;  I  was thirteen
and was crossinJ FiIth Avenue on m\  wa\  to the Fort\-second Street
librar\,  and  the coS in the middle  oI the  street muttered as I Sassed
him, “Wh\  don’t  \ou  niJJers sta\ uStown  where \ou  belonJ?” When
I  was  ten,  and  didn’t  look,   certainl\,   an\   older,   two  Solicemen
amused themselves with   me  b\   IriskinJ  me,  makinJ   comic  (and
terriI\inJ)   sSeculations concerninJ m\  ancestr\ and Srobable se[ual
Srowess, and Ior Jood measure, leavinJ  me  at   on m\  back in  one
oI  Harlem’s emSt\   lots.  Just  beIore  and then   durinJ  the  Second
World  War,  man\   oI  m\   Iriends   ed   into   the  service, all   to  be
chanJed there,  and rarel\   Ior  the  better,  man\   to be  ruined,  and

Jhettos. Some went on wine  or whiske\   or the  needle, and are still
on it. And others, like  me,  ed  into the church.
   For  the  waJes  oI  sin  were  visible  ever\where,   in  ever\   wine-
stained and  urine-sSlashed hallwa\,   in  ever\   clanJinJ  ambulance

ever\  helSless, newborn  bab\   beinJ  brouJht  into   this  danJer,  in
ever\  kniIe and  Sistol  Jht   on the  Avenue, and in  ever\  disastrous
bulletin:  a cousin,  mother  oI si[,  suddenl\   Jone mad,  the children
Sarcelled out  here and  there;  an indestructible   aunt rewarded  Ior
\ears oI  hard  labor  b\  a  slow, aJonizinJ  death  in  a terrible   small
room; someone’s briJht  son  blown  into  eternit\   b\  his  own  hand;
another turned  robber  and carried  o    to  Mail. It was  a summer oI

19
dreadIul sSeculations and discoveries, oI  which  these were not  the
worst. Crime became real, Ior  e[amSle—Ior  the  rst  time—not  as a
Sossibilit\   but  as  the  Sossibilit\.   One  would   never  deIeat  one’s
circumstances b\   workinJ   and  savinJ  one’s  Sennies; one  would
never, b\   workinJ,   acTuire  that  man\   Sennies, and,  besides, the
social treatment accorded even the  most successIul NeJroes Sroved
that one  needed, in order  to  be Iree, somethinJ  more than  a bank
account. One needed a handle, a lever, a means oI insSirinJ  Iear. It
was absolutel\ clear that  the Solice would whiS  \ou  and take \ou  in
as lonJ  as the\   could Jet  awa\   with  it,  and  that  ever\one  else—
housewives, ta[i-drivers,    elevator   bo\s,   dishwashers, bartenders,
law\ers,    MudJes, doctors,   and   Jrocers—would   never,   b\     the
oSeration oI  an\  Jenerous human  IeelinJ,  cease to  use \ou  as  an
outlet Ior his  Irustrations and hostilities.  Neither civilized  reason nor
Christian love would  cause an\  oI those SeoSle to treat \ou  as the\
Sresumabl\  wanted to  be  treated; onl\   the  Iear  oI \our   Sower  to
retaliate would   cause them to  do that,  or  to  seem to do  it,  which
was (and  is) Jood  enouJh.  There aSSears to be  a vast amount  oI
conIusion on this  Soint,  but I  do not  know  man\  NeJroes who  are
eaJer to  be “acceSted”  b\   white  SeoSle, still  less to  be  loved  b\
them; the\,  the blacks, simSl\  don’t wish to  be beaten over the head
b\  the  whites   ever\  instant  oI   our  brieI  SassaJe on  this  Slanet.
White  SeoSle in   this  countr\    will   have  Tuite  enouJh   to  do  in
learninJ  how  to  acceSt and love  themselves and  each other,  and
when the\   have  achieved this—which   will   not  be  tomorrow  and
ma\ ver\  well  be never—the NeJro Sroblem will  no lonJer  e[ist,  Ior
it will  no lonJer  be needed.
   3eoSle more advantaJeousl\  Slaced than we in Harlem  were, and
are, will   no   doubt   nd   the  Ss\choloJ\    and  the  view  oI  human
nature sketched above dismal and shockinJ  in the  e[treme.  But the
NeJro’s e[Serience oI the white  world  cannot Sossibl\ create in him
an\  resSect Ior  the standards b\   which  the  white  world  claims  to
live. His own  condition  is overwhelminJ  SrooI that  white SeoSle do
not  live  b\  these  standards. NeJro  servants have  been smuJJlinJ
odds and ends out oI white homes Ior Jenerations, and white  SeoSle
have been deliJhted  to have  them do it,  because it  has assuaJed a

20
dim Juilt  and testi ed  to the intrinsic  suSeriorit\ oI  white SeoSle.
Even the most doltish and servile NeJro could scarcel\ Iail  to  be
imSressed b\ the disSarit\  between his situation and  that oI  the
SeoSle Ior whom he worked; NeJroes who were neither doltish nor
servile did not Ieel that the\ were doinJ an\thinJ wronJ when the\
robbed white SeoSle. In sSite oI  the  3uritan-Yankee eTuation oI
virtue with  well-beinJ, NeJroes had e[cellent reasons Ior doubtinJ
that mone\ was made or keSt b\ an\ ver\ strikinJ adherence to the
Christian virtues;  it  certainl\   did  not  work  that  wa\   Ior  black
Christians. In an\ case, white SeoSle, who had robbed black SeoSle
oI their libert\  and who Sro ted  b\  this theIt ever\  hour that the\
lived, had no moral Jround on which to stand. The\ had the MudJes,
the Muries, the shotJuns, the law—in a word, Sower. But it was a
criminal Sower, to be Ieared but not resSected, and to be outwitted
in an\ wa\  whatever. And those virtues Sreached but not Sracticed
b\ the white  world were merel\ another means oI holdinJ NeJroes
in subMection.
   It  turned out, then, that  summer, that the moral  barriers that I
had suSSosed to e[ist between me and the danJers oI a criminal
career were so tenuous as to be nearl\ none[istent. I certainl\ could
not discover an\ SrinciSled reason Ior not becominJ a criminal, and
it is not m\ Soor, God-IearinJ Sarents who are to be indicted Ior the
lack but  this  societ\.  I  was icil\   determined—more determined,
reall\, than I  then knew—never to make m\ Seace with the Jhetto
but to die and Jo to Hell beIore I would let  an\ white  man sSit on
me, beIore I would  acceSt m\ “Slace”  in this  reSublic. I  did not
intend to allow  the white SeoSle oI this countr\  to tell  me who I
was, and limit me that wa\, and Solish me o  that wa\. And \et, oI
course, at the  same time, I  was beinJ sSat on  and de ned  and
described and limited, and could have been Solished o   with  no
e ort  whatever. Ever\  NeJro  bo\—in  m\   situation durinJ  those
\ears, at least—who reaches this Soint realizes, at once, SroIoundl\,
because he wants to live, that he stands in Jreat Seril and must  nd,
with sSeed, a “thinJ,” a Jimmick, to liIt him out, to start him on his
wa\.  And it  does not matter what the gimmiFk is. It was this  last
realization that terri ed   me and—since it  revealed that the door

21
oSened on so man\   danJers—helSed to  hurl  me  into  the  church.
And, b\  an  unIoreseeable Sarado[, it  was m\   career in  the church
that turned out, Srecisel\,  to be m\  Jimmick.
   For  when I  tried  to  assess m\  caSabilities, I  realized  that  I had
almost none. In order to  achieve the liIe  I wanted, I  had been dealt,
it  seemed to  me, the  worst  Sossible hand.  I  could  not  become a
Srize- Jhter—man\   oI us tried  but  ver\  Iew  succeeded. I could not
sinJ. I could not  dance. I had been well conditioned  b\  the world  in
which I  Jrew  uS, so I did  not \et  dare  take the idea  oI becominJ a
writer  seriousl\.   The onl\   other  Sossibilit\   seemed to involve   m\
becominJ one  oI the  sordid  SeoSle on the  Avenue, who  were  not
reall\  as sordid as I  then imaJined  but  who IriJhtened  me terribl\,
both because I  did  not want  to  live  that  liIe  and  because oI what
the\   made me  Ieel.  Ever\thinJ    in amed   me,  and  that   was bad
enouJh,  but   I   m\selI   had   also  become  a   source  oI    re    and
temStation. I had  been Iar too well  raised, alas, to suSSose that an\
oI  the   e[tremel\    e[Slicit    overtures  made  to   me  that   summer,
sometimes b\  bo\s   and Jirls   but  also, more  alarminJl\,    b\  older
men and women, had an\thinJ  to  do with  m\  attractiveness. On the
contrar\,   since the  Harlem  idea  oI  seduction is,  to  Sut  it  mildl\,
blunt, whatever  these SeoSle saw in me merel\ con rmed   m\  sense
oI m\  deSravit\.
   It  is certainl\   sad that  the awakeninJ  oI one’s senses should lead
to such a merciless MudJment oI oneselI—to sa\ nothinJ oI  the time
and anJuish one sSends in the e ort  to arrive at  an\  other—but it  is
also inevitable  that a  literal  attemSt to  mortiI\   the   esh  should be
made amonJ black SeoSle like those with whom  I Jrew  uS. NeJroes
in  this  countr\—and   NeJroes do  not,  strictl\   or  leJall\   sSeakinJ,
e[ist in  an\  other—are tauJht  reall\  to  desSise themselves Irom the
moment their  e\es oSen on the world.  This world  is white  and the\
are black. White  SeoSle hold the Sower, which means that  the\  are
suSerior to blacks (intrinsicall\,    that is:  God decreed it so), and the
world  has innumerable  wa\s  oI makinJ  this  di erence   known  and
Ielt   and   Ieared.  LonJ   beIore   the   NeJro   child    Serceives  this
di erence,  and even lonJer  beIore he  understands it, he  has beJun
to react to it,  he has beJun to be controlled  b\  it.  Ever\  e ort  made

22
b\  the child’s  elders to  SreSare him Ior a  Iate Irom  which  the\
cannot Srotect him causes him secretl\, in terror, to beJin to await,
without knowinJ that he is doinJ so, his m\sterious and ine[orable
Sunishment. He must be “Jood”  not  onl\  in  order  to Slease his
Sarents and not onl\ to avoid beinJ Sunished b\ them; behind their
authorit\ stands another, nameless and imSersonal, in nitel\ harder
to Slease, and bottomlessl\ cruel. And this   lters  into  the child’s
consciousness throuJh his Sarents’ tone oI voice as  he is  beinJ
e[horted, Sunished, or loved; in the sudden, uncontrollable note oI
Iear heard in his mother’s or his Iather’s voice when he has stra\ed
be\ond some Sarticular  boundar\.  He  does not know  what  the
boundar\  is,  and  he  can  Jet   no  e[Slanation  oI  it,   which   is
IriJhteninJ enouJh, but the Iear he hears in the voices oI his elders
is more IriJhteninJ still. The Iear that I  heard in m\ Iather’s voice,
Ior  e[amSle, when he  realized that  I  reall\   believed I could do
an\thinJ a white  bo\ could do, and had ever\ intention  oI SrovinJ
it, was not at all like the Iear I heard when one oI us was ill or had
Iallen down the  stairs or  stra\ed too  Iar  Irom the  house. It was
another Iear, a Iear that the child, in challenJinJ the white world’s
assumStions, was SuttinJ himselI in the Sath oI destruction. A child
cannot, thank Heaven, know how  vast and how  merciless is the
nature oI Sower, with what unbelievable cruelt\ SeoSle treat each
other. He reacts to the Iear in his Sarents’ voices because his Sarents
hold uS the world Ior him and he has no Srotection without them. I
deIended m\selI, as I imaJined, aJainst the Iear m\ Iather made me
Ieel b\ rememberinJ that he was ver\ old-Iashioned. Also, I Srided
m\selI on the Iact that I alread\ knew how to outwit him. To deIend
oneselI aJainst a Iear is simSl\ to insure that one will, one da\, be
conTuered b\ it; Iears must be Iaced. As Ior one’s wits, it is Must not
true that one can live b\ them—not, that is, iI one wishes reall\ to
live. That summer, in an\ case, all the Iears with which I had Jrown
uS, and which were now a Sart oI me and controlled m\ vision oI
the world, rose uS like a wall between the world and me, and drove
me into the church.
   As  I  look  back, ever\thinJ   I  did   seems curiousl\  deliberate,
thouJh it certainl\  did not seem deliberate then. For e[amSle, I did

23
not Moin the church oI which m\  Iather  was a member and in which
he Sreached. M\   best  Iriend  in  school,  who  attended  a  di erent
church, had alread\   “surrendered his  liIe  to the  Lord,”  and he was
ver\  an[ious  about  m\   soul’s salvation.  (I  wasn’t,  but an\   human
attention  was better  than  none.) One Saturda\   aIternoon,  he took
me to his  church. There were  no services that  da\,  and the church
was emSt\, e[ceSt Ior some women cleaninJ and some other women
Sra\inJ.  M\  Iriend  took me into  the back room to meet his  Sastor—
a woman. There she sat, in  her  robes, smilinJ,  an e[tremel\   Sroud
and handsome woman, with  AIrica, EuroSe, and the America  oI the
American Indian  blended in  her Iace. She was SerhaSs Iort\- ve   or
 It\    at  this   time,  and  in   our  world   she  was a  ver\    celebrated
woman. M\   Iriend  was about to  introduce  me when  she looked at
me and  smiled  and  said,  “Whose little   bo\   are  \ou?”   Now  this,
unbelievabl\,  was Srecisel\ the Shrase used b\ SimSs and racketeers
on   the   Avenue   when   the\    suJJested,  both   humorousl\     and
intensel\,  that  I  “hanJ  out”  with   them. 3erhaSs Sart  oI the  terror
the\  had caused me to Ieel came Irom the Iact that I  unTuestionabl\
wanted to  be somebody’s little bo\.  I  was so IriJhtened,  and at  the
merc\   oI   so  man\   conundrums,   that   inevitabl\,    that   summer,
someone would have taken me  over;  one doesn’t,  in  Harlem, lonJ
remain  standinJ  on   an\   auction  block.  It   was  m\   Jood  luck—
SerhaSs—that I Iound m\selI   in  the church  racket instead  oI some
other, and surrendered to a sSiritual seduction lonJ  beIore I came to
an\  carnal  knowledJe.  For  when  the  Sastor asked me,  with   that
marvellous smile,  “Whose little   bo\  are  \ou?”  m\   heart reSlied  at
once, “Wh\,  \ours.”
   The summer wore on, and thinJs  Jot worse. I  became more Juilt\
and more  IriJhtened,  and  keSt all  this  bottled   uS inside  me, and
naturall\,   inescaSabl\,  one niJht,   when  this  woman  had   nished
SreachinJ, ever\thinJ   came  roarinJ,  screaminJ,  cr\inJ   out,  and  I
Iell to  the  Jround  beIore the altar.  It  was the  stranJest sensation I
have ever had in m\  liIe—uS to that  time, or  since. I had not known
that it  was JoinJ to  haSSen, or that it  could haSSen. One moment I
was  on  m\   Ieet,  sinJinJ   and  claSSinJ  and,   at  the  same  time,
workinJ  out  in m\   head the Slot  oI a  Sla\  I was workinJ   on then;

24
the ne[t moment, with  no transition, no sensation oI IallinJ, I was
on m\  back, with the liJhts beatinJ down into m\  Iace and all the
vertical saints above me. I did not know what I was doinJ down so
low, or how I had Jot there. And the anJuish that  lled  me cannot
be described. It moved in me like one oI those  oods that devastate
counties, tearinJ  ever\thinJ   down,  tearinJ  children  Irom  their
Sarents and lovers Irom  each other,  and makinJ  ever\thinJ   an
unrecoJnizable waste. All   I  reall\    remember is  the  Sain,  the
unsSeakable Sain; it was as thouJh I were \ellinJ uS to Heaven and
Heaven would not hear me. And iI Heaven would not hear me, iI
love could not  descend Irom Heaven—to wash me, to  make me
clean—then utter disaster was m\ Sortion. Yes, it does indeed mean
somethinJ—somethinJ unsSeakable—to be born, in a white countr\,
an  AnJlo-Teutonic, antise[ual   countr\,   black.  You  ver\   soon,
without knowinJ it,  Jive uS all hoSe oI communion. Black SeoSle,
mainl\, look down or  look uS but do not look at each other, not at
\ou,  and white  SeoSle, mainl\,  look  awa\.  And  the universe is
simSl\ a soundinJ drum; there is no  wa\,  no wa\  whatever, so it
seemed then and has sometimes seemed since, to Jet throuJh a liIe,
to love \our wiIe  and children, or \our Iriends, or \our  mother and
Iather, or to be loved. The universe, which is not merel\  the stars
and the moon and the Slanets,  owers, Jrass, and trees, but other
SeoSle, has evolved no terms Ior \our e[istence, has made no room
Ior \ou,  and iI love will  not  swinJ wide the Jates, no other Sower
will or  can. And iI one desSairs—as who has not?—oI human love,
God’s love alone is leIt. But God—and I Ielt this even then, so lonJ
aJo, on that tremendous  oor, unwillinJl\—is white. And iI His love
was so Jreat, and iI He loved  all His children,  wh\  were we, the
blacks, cast down so Iar? Wh\? In  sSite oI all I  said thereaIter, I
Iound no answer on the  oor—not that answer, an\wa\—and I was
on the  oor  all  niJht.  Over me, to brinJ me “throuJh,”  the  saints
sanJ and reMoiced and Sra\ed. And in the morninJ, when the\ raised
me, the\ told me that I was “saved.”
   Well,  indeed I  was, in   a wa\,   Ior  I  was utterl\   drained  and
e[hausted, and released, Ior  the   rst   time,  Irom  all   m\  Juilt\
torment. I was aware then onl\ oI m\ relieI. For man\ \ears, I could

25
not ask m\selI  wh\  human  relieI had to  be achieved in a  Iashion at
once  so   SaJan  and   so   desSerate—in  a   Iashion   at   once   so
unsSeakabl\ old and so unutterabl\  new. And b\  the  time I was able
to ask m\selI  this Tuestion, I was also able to see that the SrinciSles
JoverninJ the  rites and customs oI the churches in  which I  Jrew uS
did not di er   Irom  the SrinciSles JoverninJ the  rites and customs oI
other  churches, white.   The SrinciSles  were  Blindness, Loneliness,
and Terror, the   rst   SrinciSle necessaril\  and activel\   cultivated  in
order  to  den\   the  two  others.  I  would   love  to  believe  that   the
SrinciSles were Faith,  HoSe, and Charit\,   but this  is clearl\   not  so
Ior most Christians, or Ior what  we call the Christian world.
   I  was  saved. But  at  the  same  time,  out  oI  a  deeS, adolescent
cunninJ I  do not Sretend to  understand, I realized immediatel\   that
I could  not  remain  in  the church  merel\   as another worshiSSer. I
would have  to Jive  m\selI  somethinJ  to do,  in order  not  to be too
bored  and   nd   m\selI   amonJ   all  the  wretched   unsaved oI   the
Avenue. And I don’t  doubt that  I also intended to  best m\  Iather on
his own  Jround.  An\wa\,   ver\   shortl\   aIter  I Moined the church, I
became a Sreacher—a YounJ Minister—and I remained in the SulSit
Ior  more  than  three  \ears.  M\    \outh   Tuickl\   made  me  a much
biJJer  drawinJ    card  than   m\   Iather.   I   Sushed this   advantaJe
ruthlessl\,   Ior  it   was  the  most  e ective    means I   had  Iound  oI
breakinJ his  hold  over me.  That was  the most  IriJhteninJ   time oI
m\  liIe, and Tuite the  most dishonest, and the resultinJ h\steria  lent
Jreat Sassion to m\   sermons—Ior a  while.  I relished  the  attention
and the  relative   immunit\    Irom  Sunishment  that  m\   new  status
Jave me, and  I  relished, above all,  the  sudden riJht   to Srivac\.   It
had to be recoJnized, aIter all,  that  I was still  a schoolbo\,  with  m\
schoolwork to  do, and  I  was also e[Sected to  SreSare at least one
sermon a week.  DurinJ  what  we  ma\  call  m\  he\da\,    I Sreached
much more oIten  than  that.  This meant that  there  were hours  and
even whole da\s  when I  could not  be interruSted—not  even b\  m\
Iather. I  had immobilized   him.  It  took rather  more  time  Ior me  to
realize that  I  had also  immobilized  m\selI,   and had  escaSed Irom
nothinJ whatever.

26
   The  church  was  ver\   e[citinJ.   It   took  a  lonJ  time   Ior  me  to
disenJaJe m\selI  Irom  this  e[citement,   and  on the  blindest,  most
visceral level, I never  reall\  have, and never will.   There is no music
like that  music, no drama like  the drama oI  the saints reMoicinJ, the
sinners  moaninJ,  the   tambourines  racinJ,   and   all  those   voices
cominJ toJether  and  cr\inJ   hol\   unto  the Lord.  There  is still,  Ior
me, no  Sathos Tuite  like  the  Sathos oI  those multicolored,   worn,
somehow triumShant   and   trans Jured   Iaces,  sSeakinJ Irom   the
deSths oI a visible,  tanJible,  continuinJ  desSair oI  the Joodness oI
the  Lord.   I   have  never   seen  an\thinJ    to   eTual  the    re    and
e[citement  that  sometimes, without  warninJ,   ll   a  church, causinJ
the  church,  as  Leadbell\   and  so man\   others  have  testi ed,    to
“rock.”  NothinJ   that  has haSSened to me  since eTuals the  Sower
and the Jlor\  that  I sometimes Ielt when, in  the middle oI  a sermon,
I knew  that  I  was  somehow, b\   some miracle,  reall\   carr\inJ,   as
the\  said, “the Word”—when  the church  and I were one. Their  Sain
and their  Mo\ were mine,  and  mine were  theirs—the\   surrendered
their  Sain and  Mo\ to me,  I  surrendered mine  to  them—and  their
cries oI “Amen!”  and “HalleluMah!” and “Yes, Lord!”  and “3raise His
name!’ and “3reach it,  brother!”  sustained and whiSSed on m\ solos
until  we  all  became eTual, wrinJinJ   wet,  sinJinJ  and  dancinJ,  in
anJuish and  reMoicinJ, at the  Ioot  oI  the  altar.  It  was, Ior  a  lonJ
time, in  sSite oI—or, not  inconceivabl\,  because oI—the shabbiness
oI m\   motives,  m\  onl\   sustenance, m\  meat and  drink.  I  rushed
home Irom school,  to the church,  to the  altar, to  be alone there,  to
commune with  Jesus, m\ dearest Friend,  who would  never Iail  me,
who knew  all the  secrets oI m\  heart. 3erhaSs He did,  but I  didn’t,
and the barJain  we  struck, actuall\,   down  there at  the  Ioot oI  the
cross, was that He would never let me  nd  out.
   He Iailed  His barJain. He was a much better Man than  I took Him
Ior. It  haSSened, as thinJs do, imSerceStibl\, in man\  wa\s  at once.
I date  it—the  slow crumblinJ   oI m\   Iaith,  the Sulverization  oI  m\
Iortress—Irom the  time,  about a  \ear  aIter I  had  beJun to  Sreach,
when I beJan  to read aJain.  I Musti ed this desire b\   the Iact that  I
was still  in   school, and  I  beJan, Iatall\,   with   Dostoevski. B\   this
time, I  was in  a  hiJh  school that  was  Sredominantl\  Jewish.  This

27
meant that I  was surrounded b\  SeoSle who were, b\ de nition,
be\ond an\ hoSe oI salvation, who lauJhed at the tracts and lea ets
I brouJht to school, and who Sointed out that the GosSels had been
written lonJ aIter the death oI Christ. This miJht not have been so
distressinJ iI it  had not  Iorced me to read  the tracts and lea ets
m\selI, Ior  the\   were indeed, unless one believed their  messaJe
alread\, imSossible to believe. I remember IeelinJ diml\ that there
was a kind oI blackmail in it.  3eoSle, I Ielt, ouJht to love the Lord
beFause the\ loved Him, and not because the\ were aIraid oI JoinJ
to Hell. I was Iorced, reluctantl\, to realize that the Bible itselI had
been written b\   men, and translated b\   men out  oI lanJuaJes I
could not read,  and I  was alread\, without  Tuite  admittinJ  it  to
m\selI, terribl\  involved with  the e ort  oI SuttinJ words on SaSer.
OI  course, I  had  the  rebuttal  read\:  These men  had  all  been
oSeratinJ under divine insSiration. Had the\? All  oI them? And  I
also knew b\  now, alas, Iar  more about divine insSiration than  I
dared admit, Ior  I  knew  how I  worked  m\selI  uS into  m\   own
visions, and how IreTuentl\—indeed, incessantl\—the visions God
Jranted to me di ered Irom  the visions He Jranted to m\ Iather. I
did not understand the dreams I had at niJht, but I knew that the\
were not hol\. For that  matter, I knew that m\  wakinJ hours were
Iar Irom hol\.  I sSent most oI m\ time  in a state oI reSentance Ior
thinJs I had vividl\  desired to do but had not done. The Iact that I
was dealinJ with Jews brouJht the whole Tuestion oI color, which I
had been desSeratel\ avoidinJ, into the terri ed center oI m\ mind.
I realized that  the Bible had been written  b\  white  men. I  knew
that, accordinJ to man\ Christians, I was a descendant oI Ham, who
had been cursed, and that I was thereIore Sredestined to be a slave.
This had nothinJ to do with an\thinJ  I was, or contained, or could
become; m\ Iate  had been sealed Iorever, Irom the beJinninJ  oI
time.   And  it    seemed, indeed,   when   one  looked   out   over
Christendom, that this was what Christendom e ectivel\ believed. It
was certainl\ the wa\  it  behaved. I remembered the Italian Sriests
and bishoSs blessinJ  Italian  bo\s  who   were  on  their  wa\   to
EthioSia.

28
   AJain,  the  Jewish bo\s  in  hiJh  school  were troublinJ   because I
could   nd   no  Soint  oI connection  between  them  and  the  Jewish
Sawnbrokers and landlords  and  Jrocer\-store  owners  in  Harlem. I
knew that  these SeoSle were Jews—God knows I  was told  it  oIten
enouJh—but I thouJht  oI  them onl\   as white. Jews, as such, until  I
Jot to  hiJh school, were  all incarcerated  in the  Old Testament, and
their  names were  Abraham, Moses, Daniel,  Ezekiel,  and Job,  and
Shadrach, Meshach, and AbedneJo. It was bewilderinJ  to  nd   them
so man\ miles  and centuries out  oI EJ\St,  and so Iar Irom  the  er\
Iurnace. M\  best Iriend  in  hiJh  school was  a Jew. He  came to our
house once,  and  aIterward  m\    Iather  asked, as  he  asked about
ever\one, “Is  he a Christian?”—b\   which he meant  “Is he saved?” I
reall\  do  not  know  whether m\   answer came out  oI  innocence or
venom, but I  said coldl\,  “No.  He’s Jewish.” M\  Iather  slammed me
across the Iace with his  Jreat Salm, and in  that moment  ever\thinJ
 ooded  back—all  the  hatred  and all  the  Iear,  and the  deSth oI  a
merciless resolve to kill m\  Iather rather  than allow m\  Iather  to kill
me—and I   knew  that   all  those  sermons  and  tears  and  all  that
reSentance and reMoicinJ had chanJed nothinJ. I wondered iI  I  was
e[Sected to  be  Jlad  that  a Iriend   oI  mine,  or  an\one,  was to  be
tormented Iorever in  Hell, and I  also thouJht,  suddenl\, oI  the Jews
in another Christian nation,  German\. The\  were not  so Iar Irom the
 er\   Iurnace  aIter all,  and  m\  best Iriend  miJht  have  been one oI
them. I  told  m\  Iather,  “He’s a better  Christian  than \ou   are,” and
walked out oI the  house. The battle between us was in the oSen, but
that was all riJht;  it  was almost a relieI. A  more deadl\  struJJle had
beJun.
   BeinJ in  the SulSit was like  beinJ in the  theatre; I was behind the
scenes and knew  how  the illusion   was worked.  I  knew  the  other
ministers and knew  the  Tualit\   oI their  lives.  And I  don’t  mean to
suJJest b\   this  the  “Elmer  Gantr\”    sort  oI  h\Socris\   concerninJ
sensualit\; it  was a deeSer, deadlier, and more subtle h\Socris\ than
that, and  a little   honest sensualit\,  or  a lot,  would  have  been like
water  in  an  e[tremel\    bitter   desert.  I  knew  how  to   work  on  a
conJreJation until   the last  dime was  surrendered—it was  not ver\
hard to  do—and  I  knew  where  the  mone\  Ior  “the   Lord’s work”

29
went. I knew, thouJh I did not wish to know it, that I had no resSect
Ior the SeoSle with whom I worked. I could not  have said it then,
but I also knew that iI I continued I would soon have no resSect Ior
m\selI.  And  the  Iact  that  I  was  “the  \ounJ   Brother  Baldwin”
increased m\ value with those same SimSs and racketeers who had
helSed to stamSede me into the church in the  rst Slace. The\ still
saw the little bo\ the\  intended to take over. The\ were waitinJ Ior
me to come to m\ senses and realize that I was in a ver\ lucrative
business. The\ knew that I did not \et  realize this, and also that I
had not \et beJun to susSect where m\ own needs, Foming uS (the\
were ver\ Satient), could drive me. The\ themselves did know the
score, and the\ knew that the odds were in their Iavor, And, reall\, I
knew it, too.  I was even lonelier and more vulnerable than I  had
been beIore. And the blood oI the Lamb had not cleansed me in an\
wa\ whatever. I was Must as black as I had been the da\ that I was
born. ThereIore, when I Iaced a conJreJation, it beJan to take all
the strenJth I had not to stammer, not to curse, not to tell them to
throw awa\  their Bibles and Jet o    their knees and Jo home and
orJanize, Ior  e[amSle,  a  rent  strike.  When  I  watched  all  the
children, their coSSer, brown, and beiJe Iaces starinJ uS at me as I
tauJht Sunda\ school, I Ielt that I was committinJ a crime in talkinJ
about the Jentle Jesus, in tellinJ  them to reconcile themselves to
their miser\ on earth in order to Jain the crown oI eternal liIe. Were
onl\  NeJroes to Jain this crown? Was Heaven, then, to be merel\
another Jhetto? 3erhaSs I miJht have been able to reconcile m\selI
even to this iI I had been able to believe that there was an\ lovinJ-
kindness to be Iound in the haven I reSresented. But I had been in
the SulSit too lonJ  and I  had seen too man\  monstrous thinJs. I
don’t reIer merel\  to the  JlarinJ Iact  that the  minister eventuall\
acTuires houses and Cadillacs while the IaithIul continue to scrub
 oors and droS their dimes and Tuarters and dollars into the Slate. I
reall\ mean that there was no love in the church. It was a mask Ior
hatred and selI-hatred and desSair. The trans JurinJ Sower oI the
Hol\ Ghost ended when the service ended, and salvation stoSSed at
the church  door. When we  were told   to love  ever\bod\,   I  had
thouJht that that meant everybody. But no. It aSSlied onl\ to those

30
who believed as we did, and it did  not aSSl\  to white SeoSle at all. I
was told  b\   a minister,   Ior  e[amSle,  that  I  should never,  on  an\
Sublic conve\ance,  under an\  circumstances, rise and Jive  m\  seat
to a white   woman. White  men never  rose Ior NeJro  women. Well,
that was true  enouJh,  in the  main—I  saw his Soint.  But  what was
the Soint,  the  SurSose, oI my salvation  iI  it  did  not  Sermit  me to
behave with   love   toward   others,  no  matter   how  the\    behaved
toward me? What others did was their  resSonsibilit\,  Ior which  the\
would answer when  the MudJment trumSet sounded. But what I did
was my resSonsibilit\,  and I  would  have to  answer, too—unless, oI
course, there  was  also  in  Heaven  a  sSecial disSensation Ior   the
beniJhted black, who was not to  be MudJed in the same wa\ as other
human beinJs,  or  anJels. It  Srobabl\   occurred to  me  around  this
time  that  the  vision  SeoSle hold   oI  the  world  to  come  is  but  a
re ection,   with   Sredictable  wishIul   distortions,   oI   the  world   in
which the\   live. And  this did  not  aSSl\ onl\   to NeJroes, who  were
no more “simSle” or “sSontaneous” or “Christian”   than an\bod\  else
—who were  merel\  more  oSSressed. In the same wa\  that  we, Ior
white  SeoSle,  were  the   descendants oI  Ham,   and  were  cursed
Iorever, white  SeoSle were, Ior us, the descendants oI Cain. And the
Sassion with which we loved  the Lord was a measure oI how deeSl\
we Ieared and distrusted and, in the  end, hated almost all stranJers,
alwa\s, and avoided and desSised ourselves.
   But I  cannot leave it  at that; there  is more to it  than that.  In sSite
oI ever\thinJ,   there  was  in  the liIe   I  ed   a  zest and  a Mo\ and a
caSacit\ Ior  IacinJ  and survivinJ  disaster that  are ver\  movinJ  and
ver\  rare.  3erhaSs we were,  all  oI  us—SimSs, whores, racketeers,
church members, and children—bound toJether b\  the nature oI our
oSSression, the sSeci c and Seculiar comSle[ oI risks we had to run;
iI so, within   these limits  we sometimes achieved with  each other  a
Ireedom that was close to love. I remember, an\wa\,  church  suSSers
and outinJs,  and,  later,  aIter I  leIt  the  church,  rent  and waistline
Sarties where raJe and sorrow  sat in  the darkness and did  not stir,
and we  ate  and  drank  and  talked  and  lauJhed  and  danced  and
IorJot  all  about  “the   man.”  We  had the  liTuor,   the  chicken,  the
music, and each other,  and had no  need to  Sretend to be what  we

31
were not. This  is the Ireedom  that one  hears in some JosSel sonJs,
Ior  e[amSle,  and in  Mazz. In all  Mazz, and esSeciall\ in  the  blues,
there is somethinJ  tart  and ironic,  authoritative   and double-edJed.
White Americans  seem to Ieel that  haSS\  sonJs are haSSy and sad
sonJs are sad, and that, God helS us, is e[actl\   the wa\  most  white
Americans  sinJ   them—soundinJ,   in   both   cases,  so  helSlessl\,
deIenselessl\ Iatuous that one dare not sSeculate on the temSerature
oI the  deeS Ireeze Irom  which   issue their  brave  and se[less  little
voices. Onl\   SeoSle who have  been “down  the  line,”   as the  sonJ
Suts it,   know  what  this   music  is  about.  I  think   it  was  BiJ  Bill
Broonz\  who  used to  sinJ  “I  Feel  So Good,”  a reall\   Mo\Iul  sonJ
about a man  who is  on his  wa\  to  the railroad  station  to meet  his
Jirl.   She’s  cominJ   home.  It   is   the  sinJer’s   incredibl\    movinJ
e[uberance that  makes one realize how  leaden the time  must  have
been while  she was Jone. There is  no Juarantee  that she will   sta\
this time,  either,  as the sinJer  clearl\   knows, and, in  Iact,  she has
not \et   actuall\  arrived.  ToniJht,   or tomorrow,   or within   the  ne[t
 ve   minutes,   he  ma\   ver\    well   be  sinJinJ   “Lonesome  in   M\
Bedroom,”  or  insistinJ,  “Ain’t   we,  ain’t  we,  JoinJ  to  make  it  all
riJht?  Well,  iI   we  don’t  toda\,   we  will   tomorrow   niJht.”   White
Americans do not understand the deSths out oI which such an ironic
tenacit\  comes, but the\   susSect that the Iorce is  sensual, and the\
are terri ed   oI sensualit\  and do  not an\  lonJer  understand it.  The
word  “sensual” is  not  intended  to  brinJ  to  mind  TuiverinJ   dusk\
maidens or SriaSic  black studs.  I am  reIerrinJ  to  somethinJ  much
simSler and much less IanciIul.  To be  sensual, I think,  is to  resSect
and reMoice in the Iorce oI liIe,  oI liIe  itselI,  and to  be Sresent in all
that one does, Irom  the e ort   oI lovinJ  to  the breakinJ  oI bread.  It
will  be a Jreat da\  Ior  America, incidentall\,    when we beJin  to eat
bread aJain, instead  oI the  blasShemous and tasteless Ioam rubber
that we  have substituted  Ior it.  And  I  am not  beinJ Irivolous  now,
either. SomethinJ  ver\  sinister  haSSens to the SeoSle oI a countr\
when the\  beJin to distrust  their  own reactions as deeSl\ as the\  do
here,  and  become  as  Mo\less as  the\    have  become.  It   is  this
individual   uncertaint\    on  the  Sart  oI  white   American  men  and
women, this  inabilit\    to renew  themselves at the  Iountain  oI  their

32
own lives,  that  makes the discussion, let  alone  elucidation,  oI an\
conundrum—that is, an\  realit\—so   suSremel\ di cult.    The Serson
who   distrusts  himselI   has   no  touchstone   Ior   realit\—Ior     this
touchstone can be  onl\  oneselI.  Such a Serson interSoses between
himselI and  realit\   nothinJ  less than  a lab\rinth    oI attitudes.  And
these attitudes, Iurthermore,  thouJh  the  Serson is usuall\  unaware
oI it  (is  unaware oI  so much!),  are  historical  and Sublic  attitudes.
The\  do not  relate to  the Sresent an\  more than  the\  relate  to the
Serson. ThereIore,   whatever  white   SeoSle  do   not  know   about
NeJroes reveals, Srecisel\ and  ine[orabl\,    what the\   do  not know
about themselves.
   White  Christians have also IorJotten several elementar\  historical
details. The\  have IorJotten  that  the reliJion  that  is now  identi ed
with  their  virtue  and  their  Sower—“God  is on  our  side,”  sa\s Dr.
Verwoerd—came out  oI  a  rock\   Siece oI  Jround  in  what  is  now
known  as the Middle   East beIore color  was  invented,  and that  in
order Ior the Christian  church to be established, Christ had to be Sut
to  death,  b\   Rome, and  that   the  real  architect  oI   the  Christian
church was not  the disreSutable, sunbaked Hebrew who  Jave it  his
name but  the mercilessl\  Ianatical  and  selI-riJhteous St. 3aul.  The
enerJ\  that  was buried  with  the rise  oI the  Christian  nations must
come back  into  the  world;  nothinJ   can Srevent  it.  Man\   oI us,  I
think, both  lonJ to see this haSSen and are terri ed  oI it,  Ior thouJh
this transIormation  contains the hoSe oI liberation,  it also imSoses a
necessit\ Ior  Jreat  chanJe. But in  order  to deal  with  the untaSSed
and dormant Iorce  oI the Sreviousl\  subMuJated, in order to survive
as a human, movinJ, moral weiJht  in the world,  America and all  the
Western nations will  be Iorced to  reë[amine themselves and release
themselves Irom man\  thinJs  that  are now taken  to be sacred, and
to discard nearl\   all the  assumStions that have been used to MustiI\
their lives and their  anJuish and their crimes so lonJ.
   “The  white man’s Heaven,” sinJs a Black Muslim  minister,  “is the
black  man’s Hell.”   One  ma\  obMect—Sossibl\—that this  Suts  the
matter somewhat  too simSl\,  but  the  sonJ is true,  and it  has been
true Ior as lonJ as white men have ruled the  world. The AIricans Sut
it another  wa\:  When the white  man came to AIrica,  the white  man

33
had the Bible and  the AIrican  had the land,  but now  it  is the white
man who is beinJ, reluctantl\   and bloodil\,  seSarated Irom the land,
and the AIrican  who is  still  attemStinJ to  diJest or  to vomit  uS the
Bible.  The  struJJle,  thereIore,   that  now   beJins  in  the  world   is
e[tremel\   comSle[,  involvinJ   the  historical  role  oI  Christianit\   in
the realm oI Sower—that is,  Solitics—and in the realm  oI morals. In
the realm  oI Sower, Christianit\    has oSerated with  an unmitiJated
arroJance  and   cruelt\—necessaril\,    since   a  reliJion    ordinaril\
imSoses on those who  have discovered the  true  Iaith  the  sSiritual
dut\  oI  liberatinJ  the  in dels.  This  Sarticular  true Iaith,  moreover,
is more deeSl\  concerned about the  soul than  it is  about the  bod\,
to which  Iact the   esh  (and the  corSses) oI countless in dels  bears
witness. It  Joes without   sa\inJ,   then,  that  whoever  Tuestions the
authorit\   oI the true  Iaith  also contests the riJht  oI the nations  that
hold this  Iaith to  rule  over him—contests, in  short, their  title  to his
land. The sSreadinJ oI  the GosSel, reJardless oI the motives  or the
inteJrit\    or   the  heroism   oI  some  oI   the  missionaries,  was   an
absolutel\  indisSensable Musti cation  Ior  the  SlantinJ  oI  the   aJ.
3riests and nuns and school-teachers helSed to Srotect and  sanctiI\
the Sower  that  was so ruthlessl\   beinJ  used b\   SeoSle who were
indeed seekinJ a  cit\,   but  not  one in  the  heavens, and one  to  be
made, ver\  de nitel\,    b\  caStive hands. The Christian  church itselI
—aJain, as distinJuished Irom  some oI its ministers—sancti ed   and
reMoiced in the conTuests oI the  aJ,   and encouraJed, iI  it  did  not
Iormulate, the  belieI that  conTuest, with  the resultinJ  relative  well-
beinJ oI  the  Western SoSulations, was  SrooI oI  the  Iavor  oI  God.
God had come a lonJ  wa\  Irom  the desert—but  then so had Allah,
thouJh in  a ver\  di erent   direction. God, JoinJ  north, and  risinJ on
the winJs oI Sower, had become white, and Allah, out  oI Sower, and
on the dark side oI  Heaven, had become—Ior all Sractical SurSoses,
an\wa\—black.  Thus, in  the realm oI  morals the role oI Christianit\
has been,  at  best,  ambivalent.  Even  leavinJ   out  oI  account  the
remarkable arroJance  that  assumed that  the  wa\s   and morals  oI
others were inIerior   to those oI  Christians, and  that  the\  thereIore
had ever\   riJht,   and  could  use an\   means, to  chanJe  them,  the
collision  between cultures—and  the  schizoShrenia in  the  mind  oI

34
Christendom—had rendered  the  domain  oI  morals as  chartless as
the sea once was, and as treacherous as the sea still is. It  is not too
much to  sa\  that whoever  wishes to  become a trul\   moral  human
beinJ (and let  us not ask whether  or not  this is Sossible; I think  we
must believe that it  is  Sossible) must  rst   divorce  himselI  Irom  all
the Srohibitions,  crimes, and h\Socrisies  oI the  Christian church.  II
the conceSt oI  God has an\   validit\   or  an\  use, it  can  onl\   be to
make us larJer, Ireer, and more lovinJ.  II God cannot do this, then it
is time we Jot rid  oI Him.
I HAD     HEARD a Jreat  deal, lonJ  beIore I  nall\    met  him, oI  the
Honorable EliMah Muhammad, and oI the Nation oI Islam movement,
oI which he is the leader. I  Said ver\  little  attention to  what I heard,
because the burden oI his  messaJe did not strike  me as beinJ  ver\
oriJinal;  I had been hearinJ  variations  oI it  all m\   liIe. I  sometimes
Iound  m\selI   in  Harlem  on  Saturda\   niJhts,  and  I  stood  in   the
crowds, at  125th  Street  and Seventh Avenue,  and  listened to  the
Muslim sSeakers. But I had heard hundreds oI such sSeeches—or so
it  seemed to me at   rst.   An\wa\,    I have  lonJ  had a  ver\  de nite
tendenc\  to  tune out  the  moment  I  come an\where  near  either  a
SulSit  or  a  soaSbo[.  What  these  men  were  sa\inJ   about  white
SeoSle I  had  oIten  heard  beIore. And   I  dismissed the  Nation  oI
Islam’s demand Ior  a seSarate black econom\  in  America,  which  I
had also heard beIore,  as willIul,   and even mischievous,  nonsense.
Then two  thinJs caused me to  beJin  to listen  to  the sSeeches, and
one was  the   behavior  oI  the  Solice.  AIter   all,   I  had  seen men
draJJed Irom   their  SlatIorms  on  this  ver\   corner  Ior  sa\inJ   less
virulent   thinJs,    and   I   had   seen  man\    crowds   disSersed  b\
Solicemen, with   clubs  or  on  horseback. But  the  Solicemen  were
doinJ  nothinJ   now.   Obviousl\,   this   was  not  because  the\   had
become more  human   but  because  the\   were  under  orders   and
because the\    were  aIraid.   And   indeed  the\    were,  and   I   was
deliJhted to  see it. There  the\  stood, in  twos and  threes and Iours,
in their  Cub Scout uniIorms  and with  their  Cub Scout Iaces, totall\
unSreSared, as is the wa\ with  American  he-men, Ior an\thinJ   that

35
could not  be  settled with   a club  or  a   st  or  a  Jun.  I  miJht  have
Sitied them  iI  I  had not  Iound  m\selI  in  their  hands  so oIten  and
discovered, throuJh uJl\   e[Serience, what the\  were  like when they
held the Sower and  what the\   were like  when you held  the Sower.
The behavior oI  the crowd,  its  silent intensit\,   was the  other thinJ
that  Iorced   me  to   reassess the  sSeakers and   their   messaJe. I
sometimes think,  with  desSair, that  Americans will  swallow  whole
an\  Solitical   sSeech whatever—we’ve been doinJ   ver\   little  else,
these last, bad \ears—so it  ma\  not  mean an\thinJ   to sa\  that  this
sense oI inteJrit\,   aIter  what Harlem,  esSeciall\,  has been throuJh
in  the wa\   oI  demaJoJues, was a ver\   startlinJ   chanJe. Still,  the
sSeakers had an  air   oI  utter   dedication,  and  the  SeoSle looked
toward them  with  a kind oI  intelliJence  oI hoSe on their  Iaces—not
as thouJh the\  were  beinJ consoled or  druJJed but  as thouJh the\
were beinJ Molted.
   3ower  was the subMect oI the sSeeches I heard. We were o ered,
as Nation  oI   Islam  doctrine,  historical   and  divine  SrooI  that   all
white SeoSle are cursed, and are devils, and are about to be brouJht
down. This has been revealed b\   Allah  HimselI to  His SroShet, the
Honorable EliMah Muhammad. The white  man’s rule  will  be  ended
Iorever  in  ten  or   Iteen   \ears  (and  it  must  be conceded  that  all
Sresent siJns would  seem to  bear  witness  to  the accurac\   oI  the
SroShet’s statement). The crowd  seemed to  swallow  this  theoloJ\
with  no e ort—all    crowds do swallow  theoloJ\   this  wa\,  I  Jather,
in  both   sides oI   Jerusalem, in   Istanbul,  and   in  Rome—and,  as
theoloJ\  Joes, it  was  no more  indiJestible  than  the  more Iamiliar
brand assertinJ that  there is a  curse on the sons oI Ham.  No more,
and no less, and it had been desiJned Ior the same SurSose; namel\,
the  sancti cation    oI  Sower.  But   ver\   little   time   was  sSent  on
theoloJ\,  Ior  one did  not need to  Srove to  a Harlem  audience that
all white  men  were devils. The\   were merel\  Jlad  to  have, at last,
divine  corroboration   oI  their   e[Serience,  to  hear—and  it   was  a
tremendous thinJ  to  hear—that the\   had been lied  to  Ior all  these
\ears and Jenerations,  and that  their caStivit\   was endinJ,  Ior God
was black. Wh\ were  the\  hearing it now, since this was not the  rst
time  it  had  been said?  I  had  heard it   man\   times, Irom   various

36
SroShets, durinJ   all   the   \ears   that   I   was  JrowinJ    uS.  EliMah
Muhammad himselI  has now  been  carr\inJ   the same messaJe Ior
more than  thirt\    \ears;  he is  not  an  overniJht  sensation, and  we
owe his ministr\,   I am  told, to  the Iact that  when he was a  child oI
si[ or  so, his Iather was l\nched beIore his e\es.  (So much Ior states’
riJhts.) And now,  suddenl\, SeoSle who have never beIore been able
to hear this  messaJe hear it, and believe it,  and are chanJed. EliMah
Muhammad  has  been  able   to  do   what   Jenerations  oI   welIare
workers and  committees  and resolutions  and  reSorts and  housinJ
SroMects and Sla\Jrounds have  Iailed  to  do:  to  heal  and  redeem
drunkards and  Munkies, to convert  SeoSle who  have  come out  oI
Srison and  to   keeS them  out,  to   make men  chaste  and  women
virtuous,  and to  invest both  the  male and the  Iemale with   a Sride
and a serenit\  that  hanJ about  them like  an unIailinJ  liJht.   He has
done all these thinJs,  which  our Christian  church has sSectacularl\
Iailed to do. How has EliMah manaJed it?
   Well,  in a wa\—and  I  have no wish  to minimize  his Seculiar role
and his Seculiar achievement—it is not he who has done it  but time.
Time catches uS with kinJdoms and crushes them, Jets its teeth into
doctrines and  rends them;  time  reveals  the Ioundations  on  which
an\  kinJdom  rests, and  eats at  those Ioundations,  and  it  destro\s
doctrines b\  SrovinJ  them to  be untrue.  In  those da\s,  not so ver\
lonJ  aJo, when  the  Sriests oI  that  church  which  stands  in  Rome
Jave God’s  blessinJ  to  Italian   bo\s   beinJ  sent  out  to   ravaJe  a
deIenseless black countr\—which  until  that event, incidentall\,    had
not considered itselI to  be black—it  was not Sossible to believe in  a
black God. To entertain  such a belieI  would  have been to entertain
madness. But time has Sassed, and in that time  the Christian  world
has revealed itselI as morall\  bankruSt and  Soliticall\   unstable. The
Tunisians were  Tuite riJht   in  1956—and  it  was a  ver\  siJni cant
moment in Western (and AIrican)  histor\—when  the\  countered the
French Musti cation Ior remaininJ  in  North AIrica  with  the Tuestion
“Are   the  FrenFh read\    Ior  selI-Jovernment?”   AJain,   the   terms
“civilized”    and  “Christian”    beJin  to   have  a  ver\    stranJe  rinJ,
Sarticularl\  in  the ears oI those who have been MudJed to be neither
civilized  nor Christian, when  a Christian nation  surrenders to a Ioul

37
and violent  orJ\,   as German\  did  durinJ  the  Third  Reich. For  the
crime  oI  their  ancestr\,   millions   oI  SeoSle in  the  middle  oI   the
twentieth  centur\,  and in  the heart oI  EuroSe—God’s citadel—were
sent to a death so calculated,  so hideous, and so SrolonJed that  no
aJe beIore this  enliJhtened one had  been able to  imaJine  it, much
less achieve and record it.  Furthermore, those beneath  the Western
heel,  unlike   those  within   the   West,  are  aware  that   German\’s
current   role   in   EuroSe   is  to    act  as   a   bulwark   aJainst   the
“uncivilized”   hordes, and since Sower  is what  the Sowerless want,
the\  understand ver\   well  what we  oI the  West want  to keeS, and
are not deluded  b\  our  talk oI  a Ireedom  that we  have never been
willinJ  to  share with them.  From m\  own  Soint oI  view, the  Iact oI
the  Third   Reich  alone  makes  obsolete  Iorever  an\    Tuestion  oI
Christian  suSeriorit\,  e[ceSt  in  technoloJical   terms. White  SeoSle
were, and are, astounded b\ the holocaust in German\.  The\  did not
know that  the\  could act  that wa\.   But I ver\   much doubt  whether
black SeoSle were  astounded—at least,  in  the  same wa\.  For  m\
Sart,  the  Iate   oI  the   Jews, and   the  world’s   indi erence    to  it,
IriJhtened  me ver\   much. I  could  not  but  Ieel, in  those sorrowIul
\ears,  that  this  human  indi erence,   concerninJ  which   I  knew  so
much alread\,   would   be m\   Sortion  on  the  da\   that  the  United
States decided to murder its  NeJroes s\stematicall\   instead oI little
b\  little   and  catch-as-catch-can. I  was,  oI  course,  authoritativel\
assured that what had  haSSened to the Jews in German\  could not
haSSen to the NeJroes in  America, but  I thouJht,  bleakl\,   that  the
German Jews had Srobabl\ believed similar  counsellors, and, aJain,
I could not share the white  man’s vision oI himselI Ior  the ver\  Jood
reason that white  men in America do  not behave toward  black men
the wa\  the\  behave toward  each other. When a white  man Iaces a
black man, esSeciall\ iI  the black man is helSless, terrible thinJs  are
revealed. I know.  I have been carried  into Srecinct basements oIten
enouJh,  and I   have  seen and  heard  and  endured  the  secrets oI
desSerate white men and women,  which the\   knew were  saIe with
me, because even iI I should  sSeak, no one would  believe me. And
the\  would  not believe me Srecisel\  because the\ would  know  that
what I said was true.

38
   The treatment  accorded the NeJro  durinJ  the Second World  War
marks, Ior me, a turninJ  Soint in the NeJro’s relation  to America. To
Sut it   brie \,    and  somewhat  too  simSl\,   a certain   hoSe died,  a
certain resSect Ior white  Americans Iaded. One beJan to Sit\   them,
or to hate  them. You must Sut  \ourselI  in the  skin oI a  man who is
wearinJ the  uniIorm  oI  his countr\,   is  a candidate Ior  death in  its
deIense, and who is called  a “niJJer”   b\  his  comrades-in-arms and
his o cers;    who is  almost alwa\s   Jiven  the hardest,  uJliest,  most
menial work  to do; who  knows that  the white  G.I. has inIormed the
EuroSeans that he is  subhuman (so much  Ior  the American  male’s
se[ual securit\);   who  does not dance at the  U.S.O. the niJht  white
soldiers dance  there, and  does not  drink   in  the  same bars  white
soldiers drink  in;  and who  watches German Srisoners oI war  beinJ
treated b\   Americans with   more human  diJnit\    than  he has ever
received at  their  hands. And  who,  at  the  same time,  as a human
beinJ, is Iar  Ireer in  a stranJe land  than he has ever been at home.
Home! The ver\   word  beJins  to  have a  desSairinJ and  diabolical
rinJ. You must consider what haSSens to this citizen, aIter all  he has
endured, when he returns—home: search, in his shoes, Ior a Mob, Ior
a Slace to live;  ride,  in  his skin,  on seJreJated buses; see, with his
e\es, the  siJns  sa\inJ   “White”   and “Colored,”   and  esSeciall\  the
siJns that  sa\ “White   Ladies” and  “Colored Women”; look  into  the
e\es oI his wiIe; look  into the e\es  oI his son; listen, with  his ears, to
Solitical  sSeeches, North and South; imaJine \ourselI   beinJ told  to
“wait.”  And all  this is haSSeninJ in the  richest and Ireest countr\  in
the world,  and  in  the middle  oI  the  twentieth  centur\.   The subtle
and  deadl\  chanJe  oI   heart  that  miJht   occur  in   \ou   would  be
involved with   the realization  that  a civilization   is not  destro\ed b\
wicked SeoSle; it  is  not necessar\  that SeoSle be wicked  but  onl\
that the\  be sSineless. I and two NeJro acTuaintances, all oI us well
Sast thirt\,    and  lookinJ  it,   were  in  the  bar  oI  ChicaJo’s  O’Hare
AirSort several  months aJo, and  the bartender  reIused to serve us,
because, he said, we  looked  too  \ounJ.  It   took  a vast  amount oI
Satience not to stranJle  him, and  Jreat insistence and some luck to
Jet the manaJer, who deIended his bartender  on the Jround  that he
was “new” and  had not \et,  Sresumabl\,  learned how to  distinJuish

39
between a NeJro bo\   oI twent\   and a NeJro  “bo\”   oI thirt\-seven.
Well, we were served,  nall\,    oI course, but b\  this  time no amount
oI Scotch would have helSed us. The bar was ver\ crowded, and our
altercation  had been e[tremel\   nois\;   not one  customer in  the bar
had done an\thinJ  to helS us. When it  was over, and the three oI us
stood at the bar tremblinJ  with  raJe and Irustration,  and drinkinJ—
and traSSed, now, in the airSort, Ior  we had deliberatel\  come earl\
in  order  to  have  a  Iew  drinks   and  to  eat—a  \ounJ   white  man
standinJ near  us asked iI  we  were students. I  suSSose he thouJht
that  this  was the  onl\   Sossible e[Slanation   Ior  our  SuttinJ   uS a
 Jht.   I told  him  that he  hadn’t wanted  to talk  to  us earlier and  we
didn’t  want to  talk  to him  now.  The reSl\  visibl\   hurt  his IeelinJs,
and this, in  turn,  caused me to desSise him. But  when one oI  us, a
Korean War veteran, told this \ounJ  man that  the  Jht   we had been
havinJ in the  bar had been his  Jht,  too, the \ounJ   man said, “I lost
m\  conscience a lonJ time aJo,” and turned  and walked out. I  know
that one  would  rather not  think  so, but  this  \ounJ  man  is t\Sical.
So, on the basis oI the evidence, had ever\one else in the bar lost his
conscience. A Iew \ears  aJo, I would  have hated  these SeoSle with
all m\  heart.  Now I Sitied  them, Sitied them  in order  not to  desSise
them.  And   this  is   not  the   haSSiest wa\    to   Ieel  toward   one’s
countr\men.
   But,  in  the  end, it  is  the  threat  oI  universal  e[tinction   hanJinJ
over all the world  toda\  that chanJes, totall\  and Iorever, the  nature
oI realit\   and brinJs  into  devastatinJ Tuestion the  true  meaninJ oI
man’s histor\.  We human beinJs now have the Sower to e[terminate
ourselves; this seems to be the  entire sum  oI our  achievement. We
have taken  this  Mourne\ and arrived  at  this  Slace in  God’s name.
This, then, is the best that  God (the white  God) can do. II that  is so,
then it  is  time  to  reSlace Him—reSlace Him  with   what? And  this
void, this  desSair, this torment  is Ielt ever\where   in the West, Irom
the streets oI  Stockholm  to  the  churches oI  New Orleans  and the
sidewalks oI Harlem.
   God  is  black.  All  black   men belonJ   to  Islam;  the\   have  been
chosen. And Islam shall rule the  world.  The dream, the sentiment is
old;  onl\    the   color  is   new.  And   it   is   this  dream,   this   sweet

40
Sossibilit\,  that  thousands oI  oSSressed black men and  women  in
this countr\   now  carr\  awa\   with  them  aIter  the Muslim  minister
has sSoken,  throuJh   the  dark,  noisome  Jhetto   streets,  into   the
hovels  where  so  man\   have  Serished.  The  white   God  has  not
delivered them; SerhaSs the Black God will.
   While   I   was  in   ChicaJo  last   summer,  the   Honorable   EliMah
Muhammad invited  me to have dinner  at his home. This is  a statel\
mansion on ChicaJo’s South Side, and  it is  the headTuarters oI  the
Nation oI Islam movement. I  had not Jone to ChicaJo to  meet EliMah
Muhammad—he was not  in  m\  thouJhts  at all—but  the  moment I
received the   invitation,   it   occurred  to  me  that  I   ouJht  to  have
e[Sected  it.   In  a   wa\,   I  owe   the  invitation    to   the  incredible,
ab\smal, and  reall\  cowardl\   obtuseness oI white liberals.  Whether
in Srivate  debate or  in Sublic,  an\  attemSt  I made to  e[Slain  how
the Black Muslim  movement  came about, and how  it  has achieved
such  Iorce,  was  met   with   a  blankness  that   revealed  the  little
connection that the liberals’  attitudes have with  their  SerceStions or
their  lives,  or  even their   knowledJe—revealed,  in  Iact,  that  the\
could deal with  the NeJro  as a s\mbol or  a victim  but had no  sense
oI  him   as   a  man.   When  Malcolm   ;,    who   is   considered  the
movement’s second-in-command, and heir aSSarent, Soints out that
the cr\  oI  “violence”  was not raised, Ior  e[amSle,  when the Israelis
IouJht to  reJain  Israel, and, indeed, is  raised onl\  when  black men
indicate that  the\  will   Jht   Ior their riJhts,  he is sSeakinJ the truth.
The conTuests oI EnJland, ever\ sinJle one oI them  blood\,  are Sart
oI  what  Americans  have in   mind  when  the\   sSeak oI  EnJland’s
Jlor\.  In  the  United  States, violence and heroism  have been made
s\non\mous  e[ceSt  when it   comes to blacks, and  the onl\   wa\   to
deIeat Malcolm’s Soint is to concede it and then ask oneselI wh\ this
is so.  Malcolm’s  statement  is  not  answered b\   reIerences  to  the
triumShs  oI  the N.A.A.C.3.,  the  more  Sarticularl\   since  ver\   Iew
liberals  have   an\   notion   oI   how   lonJ,   how   costl\,    and  how
heartbreakinJ a task  it is  to Jather  the evidence that  one can carr\
into  court,   or   how  lonJ   such  court   battles  take.  Neither   is  it
answered b\    reIerences to   the  student  sit-in-movement,   iI   onl\
because not all NeJroes are students and not all  oI them  live in  the

41
South. I,  in  an\  case, certainl\   reIuse to  be Sut  in  the Sosition  oI
den\inJ  the truth  oI Malcolm’s statements simSl\  because I disaJree
with  his  conclusions, or  in  order  to  SaciI\  the  liberal  conscience.
ThinJs are  as bad  as the  Muslims sa\  the\   are—in  Iact,  the\   are
worse, and the Muslims do not  helS matters—but there is no reason
that  black   men  should  be   e[Sected  to   be  more  Satient,   more
IorbearinJ,  more IarseeinJ than  whites; indeed,  Tuite the  contrar\.
The real  reason that   nonviolence  is considered  to  be  a virtue   in
NeJroes—I am not sSeakinJ now oI  its racial  value, another  matter
altoJether—is  that  white  men  do  not  want  their  lives,  their   selI-
imaJe, or  their SroSert\  threatened.  One wishes the\  would  sa\  so
more oIten. At the  end oI a television  SroJram on which  Malcolm ;
and I  both aSSeared, Malcolm was  stoSSed b\ a  white  member oI
the audience who  said,  “I  have a  thousand dollars  and an  acre oI
land. What’s JoinJ   to haSSen to  me?” I  admired  the directness oI
the man’s Tuestion, but I didn’t  hear Malcolm’s  reSl\,  because I was
tr\inJ   to  e[Slain  to  someone else that  the situation   oI the  Irish  a
hundred \ears aJo and  the situation oI  the NeJro toda\  cannot  ver\
useIull\  be  comSared. NeJroes were  brouJht   here in  chains  lonJ
beIore the  Irish  ever  thouJht  oI  leavinJ  Ireland;  what   manner oI
consolation is it  to be told that  emiJrants arrivinJ   here—voluntaril\
—lonJ aIter  \ou  did  have risen Iar above \ou?  In  the hall,  as I was
waitinJ   Ior   the   elevator,   someone  shook  m\    hand   and   said,
“Goodb\e, Mr.  James Baldwin. We’ll  soon be addressinJ \ou  as Mr.
James ;.”  And I thouJht,  Ior  an awIul moment,  M\  God, iI this Joes
on much lonJer, \ou  Srobabl\  will.   EliMah Muhammad had seen this
show, I  think,   or  another  one,  and  he had  been  told  about  me.
ThereIore, late on a hot  Sunda\ aIternoon,  I Sresented m\selI at  his
door.
   I  was IriJhtened,  because I had, in e ect,   been summoned into a
ro\al  Sresence. I was IriJhtened Ior  another reason, too. I  knew the
tension in me between love  and Sower, between Sain and raJe, and
the curious,  the  JrindinJ  wa\   I  remained e[tended  between  these
Soles—SerSetuall\ attemStinJ  to choose the  better rather  than  the
worse. But this choice was a choice in terms oI  a Sersonal, a Srivate
better (I  was, aIter all,  a writer);  what  was its relevance in terms  oI

42
a social worse? Here  was the  South Side—a million   in caStivit\—
stretchinJ Irom  this  doorsteS as Iar as the  e\e could  see. And the\
didn’t  even  read;  deSressed SoSulations don’t   have  the  time  or
enerJ\  to sSare. The a uent    SoSulations, which  should have been
their  helS, didn’t,  as Iar as could  be discovered, read,  either—the\
merel\  bouJht books and devoured  them, but  not in  order to  learn:
in order to  learn new attitudes. Also, I  knew that  once I had entered
the house,  I  couldn’t  smoke or  drink,   and I  Ielt   Juilt\   about  the
ciJarettes in m\  Socket, as I had Ielt  \ears aJo  when m\  Iriend   rst
took me into  his church.  I was halI  an hour late,  havinJ Jot  lost on
the wa\  here, and I Ielt as deservinJ oI a scoldinJ as a schoolbo\.
   The  \ounJ   man  who  came  to  the  door—he  was  about  thirt\,
SerhaSs, with  a handsome,  smilinJ  Iace—didn’t  seem to   nd   m\
lateness o ensive, and led me into  a larJe  room. On one side oI the
room  sat  halI   a  dozen  women,   all  in   white;   the\   were   much
occuSied with   a  beautiIul   bab\,   who   seemed to   belonJ  to  the
\ounJest oI  the women.  On the other  side oI the room  sat seven or
eiJht men, \ounJ,  dressed in dark suits, ver\  much at ease, and ver\
imSosinJ. The  sunliJht  came into  the  room  with  the  SeaceIulness
one remembers  Irom  rooms  in  one’s earl\   childhood—a   sunliJht
encountered later onl\  in one’s dreams. I remember beinJ astounded
b\  the  Tuietness, the ease, the  Seace, the taste. I  was introduced,
the\  Jreeted  me  with   a Jenuine  cordialit\    and  resSect—and the
resSect increased  m\    IriJht,    Ior   it   meant   that   the\    e[Sected
somethinJ oI me that I  knew in m\  heart, Ior  their sakes, I could not
Jive—and we  sat  down.  EliMah Muhammad was not  in  the  room.
Conversation was slow, but  not as sti    as I had Ieared it  would  be.
The\ keSt it  JoinJ,  Ior I simSl\  did  not know  which subMects I could
acceStabl\ brinJ  uS. The\ knew  more about me, and had read more
oI what  I  had written,   than  I had  e[Sected, and  I wondered  what
the\  made oI it all,  what the\   took m\  useIulness to be. The women
were carr\inJ   on  their  own conversation,  in  low  tones; I  Jathered
that the\   were not  e[Sected  to take  Sart in  male  conversations. A
Iew women keSt cominJ in  and out oI  the room, aSSarentl\  makinJ
SreSarations Ior dinner.  We,  the  men, did  not  SlunJe  deeSl\  into
an\  subMect, Ior, clearl\, we were  all waitinJ   Ior  the aSSearance oI

43
EliMah. 3resentl\, the men, one b\  one,  leIt the  room and  returned.
Then I was asked iI  I  would like  to  wash, and I,  too, walked  down
the hall  to  the  bathroom. Shortl\   aIter  I  came back, we  stood uS,
and EliMah entered.
   I  do not know  what I  had e[Sected to  see. I had read some oI his
sSeeches, and had heard IraJments oI  others  on the  radio  and on
television, so I  associated him with  Ierocit\.  But,  no—the man who
came into the room was small and slender, reall\  ver\  delicatel\   Sut
toJether, with   a thin   Iace, larJe,  warm  e\es,  and a  most winninJ
smile. SomethinJ came into the room  with him—his  disciSles’ Mo\ at
seeinJ him, his Mo\ at seeinJ them. It was the kind  oI encounter one
watches with  a smile simSl\  because it is  so rare that  SeoSle enMo\
one another.  He teased the  women, like  a  Iather,  with  no  hint  oI
that  uJl\   and unctuous   irtatiousness   I  knew  so well   Irom  other
churches, and the\  resSonded like that, with   Jreat Ireedom and \et
Irom  a Jreat  and lovinJ   distance. He had  seen me when  he came
into the room,  I knew,  thouJh he had not  looked m\  wa\.  I  had the
IeelinJ,  as he  talked  and lauJhed  with   the others,  whom  I  could
onl\  think   oI  as his children,   that  he was  sizinJ  me uS, decidinJ
somethinJ. Now  he  turned  toward  me, to  welcome  me, with   that
marvellous smile, and  carried me back  nearl\  twent\-Iour   \ears,  to
that moment  when  the Sastor had  smiled at  me and  said, “Whose
little  bo\  are \ou?”  I  did not  resSond now as I had resSonded then,
because there are some thinJs (not man\,  alas!) that  one cannot do
twice. But  I knew  what he made  me Ieel, how  I was drawn  toward
his Seculiar authorit\,   how his smile Sromised to take the burden  oI
m\  liIe  o    m\   shoulders. Take your  burdens to the Lord  and leave
them there. The central Tualit\  in EliMah’s Iace is Sain, and his smile
is a witness to  it—Sain  so old  and deeS and black that  it  becomes
Sersonal and Sarticular onl\  when  he smiles. One wonders what he
would sound like  iI he could  sinJ. He turned to  me, with  that smile,
and said somethinJ like  “I’ve  Jot  a lot  to sa\  to you, but  we’ll  wait
until  we sit  down.” And I  lauJhed.  He made me think  oI  m\  Iather
and me as we miJht have been iI we had been Iriends.
   In the  dininJ room,  there were two lonJ  tables; the men sat at one
and the women at the other. EliMah was at the head oI our table, and

44
I was seated at his leIt. I can scarcel\ remember what  we ate, e[ceSt
that it  was  SlentiIul,  sane, and simSle—so sane and simSle  that it
made  me  Ieel   e[tremel\    decadent,  and   I   think   that   I   drank,
thereIore, two  Jlasses oI milk. EliMah mentioned havinJ seen me on
television  and   said  that  it   seemed  to  him   that   I  was  not   \et
brainwashed and  was tr\inJ    to  become m\selI.   He said  this  in  a
curiousl\  unnervinJ  wa\,   his e\es lookinJ   into  mine and one  hand
halI hidinJ  his  liSs, as thouJh  he were tr\inJ   to  conceal bad teeth.
But his teeth were not  bad. Then I remembered hearinJ  that he had
sSent time in  Srison. I suSSose that I would  like to  become m\selI,
whatever that ma\  mean, but I knew  that EliMah’s meaninJ and mine
were not  the same. I said \es,  I  was tr\inJ   to  be me, but  I did  not
know how to sa\  more than that, and so I waited.
   Whenever  EliMah sSoke, a kind  oI chorus  arose Irom   the table,
sa\inJ  “Yes, that’s riJht.”   This beJan to  set m\  teeth  on edJe. And
EliMah himselI had a Iurther, unnervinJ habit,  which was to  ricochet
his Tuestions and comments o    someone else on their  wa\  to \ou.
Now, turninJ   to  the  man  on  his riJht,   he  beJan to  sSeak oI  the
white devils  with  whom  I had last  aSSeared on TV: What had the\
made him (me) Ieel? I could not  answer this and was not  absolutel\
certain that  I was e[Sected to.  The SeoSle reIerred to had certainl\
made me Ieel e[asSerated and useless, but I did not think oI them as
devils.  EliMah went on  about  the  crimes  oI  white  SeoSle, to  this
endless chorus oI “Yes, that’s riJht.” Someone at the table said. “The
white  man sure  is a  devil.  He  Sroves that  b\  his  own  actions.”  I
looked around. It  was a ver\  \ounJ  man who had said this,  scarcel\
more than a  bo\—ver\   dark and sober, ver\   bitter.  EliMah beJan to
sSeak oI the Christian reliJion, oI Christians, in  the same soIt, MokinJ
wa\.   I  beJan  to  see  that  EliMah’s Sower  came Irom   his  sinJle-
mindedness. There is nothinJ calculated about  him; he means ever\
word he  sa\s. The  real reason, accordinJ  to EliMah, that I  Iailed  to
realize that the  white man was a devil  was that I  had been too lonJ
e[Sosed to white  teachinJ  and had never received  true instruction.
“The  so-called  American   NeJro”   is  the   onl\    reason  Allah   has
Sermitted the United  States to endure so lonJ; the white  man’s time
was uS in 1913, but it  is the will  oI  Allah that  this lost black nation,

45
the black men oI this countr\,  be redeemed Irom their  white masters
and returned  to the  true  Iaith,  which  is Islam. Until   this is  done—
and it  will  be accomSlished ver\  soon—the total  destruction  oI the
white  man is  beinJ  dela\ed.  EliMah’s mission is to  return  “the  so-
called NeJro”  to  Islam,  to  seSarate the chosen oI  Allah  Irom   this
doomed nation.   Furthermore,  the  white   man  knows  his  histor\,
knows himselI to be a devil,  and knows that  his time is runninJ  out,
and all  his  technoloJ\,  Ss\choloJ\,   science, and  “tricknoloJ\”    are
beinJ e[Sended in  the e ort   to Srevent black men Irom  hearinJ  the
truth.  This truth  is that  at the ver\   beJinninJ oI  time there  was not
one white Iace to  be Iound in  all  the universe. Black men  ruled the
earth and  the black  man was  SerIect. This is  the truth   concerninJ
the era that white  men now reIer  to as Srehistoric. The\  want  black
men to  believe that  the\,  like  white   men, once lived  in  caves and
swunJ Irom   trees and  ate  their  meat  raw  and  did   not  have the
Sower oI sSeech. But this is not true.  Black men were never in  such
a condition.  Allah allowed  the Devil,  throuJh  his scientists, to carr\
on inIernal  e[Seriments,  which  resulted,   nall\,    in  the creation  oI
the   devil   known    as  the   white    man,   and   later,    even  more
disastrousl\, in  the creation oI the white  woman. And it  was decreed
that these  monstrous creatures should  rule  the earth  Ior  a  certain
number oI  \ears—I   IorJet  how  man\  thousand,  but,  in  an\   case,
their rule  now is endinJ,  and Allah,  who had never aSSroved oI the
creation oI the white  man in the  rst   Slace (who knows him, in  Iact,
to be not  a man at all  but  a devil),  is an[ious  to restore  the rule  oI
Seace that the rise oI the white man totall\   destro\ed.  There is thus,
b\  de nition,   no virtue  in  white  SeoSle, and since the\ are another
creation entirel\   and can no more,  b\  breedinJ, become black than
a cat, b\ breedinJ,  can become a horse, there is no hoSe Ior them.
   There  is  nothinJ  new  in   this  merciless Iormulation   e[ceSt  the
e[Slicitness oI its s\mbols  and the candor oI its hatred. Its  emotional
tone is as Iamiliar   to me  as m\  own  skin; it  is  but another  wa\  oI
sa\inJ  that   sinners shall be  bound in  Hell  a  thousand years. That
sinners have alwa\s, Ior American NeJroes, been white is a truth  we
needn’t labor, and ever\  American NeJro, thereIore, risks havinJ the
Jates oI Saranoia close on him.  In  a societ\  that  is entirel\   hostile,

46
and, b\  its nature, seems determined to cut  \ou  down—that has cut
down so  man\  in  the  Sast and  cuts down  so man\   ever\  da\—it
beJins to be almost  imSossible to distinJuish  a  real Irom  a Iancied
inMur\. One can ver\  Tuickl\   cease to attemSt this distinction,   and,
what  is worse,  one usuall\   ceases to attemSt  it  without   realizinJ
that one has done so. All  doormen,  Ior e[amSle,  and all  Solicemen
have b\  now,  Ior me,  become e[actl\   the same, and m\  st\le   with
them  is   desiJned  simSl\    to   intimidate   them   beIore   the\   can
intimidate  me. No doubt I  am Juilt\   oI some inMustice here, but it is
irreducible,  since I cannot risk  assuminJ that the humanit\   oI  these
SeoSle is  more  real  to  them  than  their   uniIorms.  Most  NeJroes
cannot risk assuminJ that the humanit\   oI white  SeoSle is more real
to   them   than   their   color.   And   this   leads,   imSerceStibl\   but
inevitabl\,   to a state oI  mind  in which,  havinJ  lonJ  aJo learned to
e[Sect the  worst,  one  nds   it  ver\  eas\  to  believe  the worst.  The
brutalit\    with  which   NeJroes are  treated  in   this  countr\   simSl\
cannot be overstated, however unwillinJ   white  men ma\  be to hear
it.  In  the beJinninJ—and  neither  can  this  be overstated—a NeJro
Must cannot believe that white SeoSle are treatinJ him as the\ do; he
does not know  what he has done to  merit  it.  And when  he realizes
that the treatment  accorded him has nothinJ to  do with  an\thinJ  he
has done, that the attemSt oI  white SeoSle to destro\  him—Ior  that
is what it  is—is utterl\   Jratuitous,  it  is not hard  Ior him  to  think  oI
white SeoSle as devils. For the horrors  oI the  American NeJro’s liIe
there has been almost  no lanJuaJe.  The Srivac\  oI  his e[Serience,
which is onl\   beJinninJ  to be recoJnized in  lanJuaJe, and which  is
denied or iJnored  in  o cial    and SoSular sSeech—hence the NeJro
idiom—lends  credibilit\    to an\   s\stem  that  Sretends to  clariI\   it.
And, in  Iact,  the  truth  about  the black  man,  as a historical  entit\
and as a human beinJ, has been hidden  Irom him,  deliberatel\   and
cruell\;   the  Sower oI   the  white  world   is threatened  whenever  a
black man reIuses to acceSt the white  world’s  de nitions.   So ever\
attemSt is made  to cut  that  black  man down—not  onl\   was made
\esterda\  but  is  made toda\.   Who,  then,  is to  sa\  with   authorit\
where the root oI so much anJuish and evil  lies? Wh\,  then, is it not
Sossible that all  thinJs  beJan with  the  black man  and that  he was

47
SerIect—esSeciall\ since this is Srecisel\ the claim that white SeoSle
have Sut Iorward Ior themselves all these \ears? Furthermore, it is
now absolutel\ clear that white SeoSle are a minorit\ in the world
—so severe a minorit\   that  the\  now  look  rather more  like  an
invention—and that the\ cannot Sossibl\ hoSe to rule it an\ lonJer.
II this  is so,  wh\  is it   not also Sossible that the\  achieved their
oriJinal dominance b\  stealth and cunninJ and bloodshed and in
oSSosition to  the  will   oI  Heaven, and  not,  as the\   claim,  b\
Heaven’s will? And iI this is so, then the sword the\  have used so
lonJ aJainst others can now, without merc\, be used aJainst them.
Heavenl\ witnesses are a trick\ lot, to be used b\ whoever is closest
to Heaven at the time. And leJend and theoloJ\, which are desiJned
to sanctiI\  our Iears, crimes, and asSirations, also reveal them Ior
what the\ are.
   I said, at last, in answer to some other ricocheted Tuestions, “I leIt
the church twent\ \ears aJo and I haven’t Moined an\thinJ since.” It
was m\ wa\ oI  sa\inJ that I did not intend to  Moin their movement,
either.
   “And what are \ou now?” EliMah asked.
   I was in somethinJ oI a bind, Ior I reall\ could not sa\—could not
allow m\selI  to be stamSeded into sa\inJ—that I was a Christian.
“I? Now? NothinJ.” This was not enouJh. “I’m a writer. I like doinJ
thinJs alone.” I  heard m\selI  sa\inJ  this. EliMah smiled at me. “I
don’t, an\wa\,” I  said,  nall\,  “think about it a Jreat deal.”
   EliMah said, to his riJht, “I think he ouJht to think about it all the
deal,”  and with   this  the  table  aJreed.  But  there  was nothinJ
malicious or condemnator\ in it. I  had the sti inJ  IeelinJ that they
knew I belonJed to them but knew that I did not know it \et, that I
remained unread\, and that  the\  were  simSl\ waitinJ,  Satientl\,
and with  assurance, Ior me to discover the truth  Ior  m\selI.  For
where else, aIter all, could I Jo? I was black, and thereIore a Sart oI
Islam, and would be saved Irom the holocaust awaitinJ the white
world whether  I  would or  no.  M\  weak, deluded scruSles could
avail nothinJ aJainst the iron word oI the SroShet.
   I Ielt that I was back in m\ Iather’s house—as, indeed, in a wa\, I
was—and I told EliMah that I did not care iI white and black SeoSle

48
married, and that I had man\ white Iriends. I would have no choice,
iI it came to it, but to Serish with them, Ior (I said to m\selI, but not
to EliMah), “I love a Iew SeoSle and the\ love me and some oI them
are white, and isn’t love more imSortant than color?”
   EliMah looked at me with Jreat kindness and a ection, Jreat Sit\,
as thouJh he were readinJ m\ heart, and indicated, skeSticall\, that
I might have white Iriends, or think I did, and the\ might be tr\inJ to
be decent—now—but their time was uS. It was almost as thouJh he
were sa\inJ, “The\ had their chance, man, and the\ JooIed!”
   And I looked around the table. I certainl\ had no evidence to Jive
them that would outweiJh EliMah’s authorit\ or the evidence oI their
own lives or the  realit\  oI the streets outside. Yes, I knew two or
three SeoSle, white, whom I would trust with m\ liIe, and I knew a
Iew others, white, who were struJJlinJ as hard as the\ knew how,
and with Jreat e ort   and sweat and risk, to make the world more
human. But how could I sa\ this? One cannot arJue with an\one’s
e[Serience or decision or belieI. All m\ evidence would be thrown
out oI court as irrelevant to the main bod\  oI the case, Ior I could
cite onl\   e[ceStions. The  South Side Sroved  the Mustice oI the
indictment;  the  state  oI  the  world   Sroved  the  Mustice oI the
indictment. Ever\thinJ  else, stretchinJ back  throuJhout recorded
time, was merel\  a histor\   oI those e[ceStions who had  tried to
chanJe the world and had Iailed. Was this true? Had the\  Iailed?
How much deSended on the Soint oI view? For it would seem that a
certain cateJor\ oI e[ceStions never Iailed to make the world worse
—that cateJor\, Srecisel\, Ior whom Sower is more real than love.
And \et Sower is real, and man\ thinJs, includinJ, ver\ oIten, love,
cannot be  achieved without   it.  In   the  eeriest wa\   Sossible, I
suddenl\ had a JlimSse oI what white SeoSle must Jo throuJh at a
dinner table when the\   are tr\inJ   to Srove that  NeJroes are not
subhuman. I had almost said, aIter all, “Well, take m\ Iriend Mar\,”
and ver\ nearl\  descended to a cataloJue oI those virtues that Jave
Mar\ the riJht  to  be alive. And in what hoSe? That EliMah and the
others would nod their heads solemnl\ and sa\, at least, “Well, she’s
all riJht—but the others!”

49
   And  I  looked   aJain  at  the  \ounJ   Iaces around  the  table,  and
looked back at EliMah, who was sa\inJ that no SeoSle in histor\   had
ever been resSected who had  not owned  their  land.  And the  table
said, “Yes, that’s riJht.”  I could  not den\  the truth  oI this  statement.
For ever\one else has, is, a nation, with a sSeci c location  and a  aJ
—even, these  da\s,  the  Jew.   It  is  onl\   “the   so-called  American
NeJro” who remains traSSed, disinherited,  and desSised, in a nation
that has keSt him  in  bondaJe Ior  nearl\  Iour  hundred  \ears and  is
still  unable  to  recoJnize  him   as a  human  beinJ.  And   the  Black
Muslims, alonJ  with  man\  SeoSle who are  not Muslims,  no lonJer
wish Ior  a recoJnition  so JrudJinJ  and (should it  ever be achieved)
so tard\.    AJain,  it   cannot  be  denied  that  this  Soint   oI  view  is
abundantl\  Musti ed b\  American NeJro histor\.   It  is JallinJ  indeed
to have stood  so lonJ, hat  in  hand, waitinJ   Ior Americans  to Jrow
uS enouJh to  realiz  that  \ou   do not  threaten  them.  On the  other
hand,  how  is  the  American   NeJro  now  to   Iorm  himselI   into  a
seSarate nation? For this—and  not  onl\  Irom  the  Muslim  Soint  oI
view—would  seem  to  be  his  onl\   hoSe  oI  not  SerishinJ  in   the
American backwater  and  beinJ  entirel\    and Iorever  IorJotten,   as
thouJh  he  had never  e[isted   at  all  and  his  travail  had  been  Ior
nothinJ.
   EliMah’s intensit\ and the  bitter  isolation and  disa ection  oI  these
\ounJ  men and the  desSair oI the streets outside had caused me to
JlimSse diml\  what  ma\  now  seem to be a Iantas\,  althouJh, in  an
aJe so Iantastical, I would hesitate to sa\  Srecisel\ what a Iantas\  is.
Let us sa\ that the Muslims  were to achieve the Sossession oI the si[
or seven states that the\   claim  are owed to  NeJroes b\  the  United
States as “back Sa\ment”  Ior slave labor.  Clearl\,  the United  States
would never surrender  this territor\,   on  an\  terms whatever, unless
it Iound  it  imSossible, Ior  whatever reason, to  hold it—unless,  that
is, the United  States were to  be reduced as a world  Sower, e[actl\
the wa\,   and at  the same deJree  oI sSeed, that  EnJland has been
Iorced to relinTuish her  EmSire. (It is simSl\  not true—and  the state
oI her e[-colonies  Sroves this—that EnJland “alwa\s  meant  to Jo.”)
II the  states were Southern states—and the  Muslims seem to  Iavor
this—then the borders oI a hostile Latin  America would be raised, in

50
e ect,  to,  sa\,  Mar\land.  OI  the American  borders on  the sea, one
would  Iace toward   a Sowerless EuroSe  and the  other  toward   an
untrustworth\   and non-white  East, and on the  North, aIter  Canada,
there would be onl\   Alaska, which is a Russian border. The e ect  oI
this would be that  the white  SeoSle oI the United States and Canada
would   nd   themselves marooned on  a hostile  continent,   with  the
rest oI the  white  world  Srobabl\  unwillinJ   and certainl\   unable  to
come to their  aid. All  this is not,  to m\  mind,  the most imminent  oI
Sossibilities, but  iI   I  were a  Muslim,  this  is  the  Sossibilit\   that  I
would   nd   m\selI  holdinJ   in  the center  oI  m\  mind,  and  drivinJ
toward. And  iI I  were a Muslim,  I would  not  hesitate to utilize—or,
indeed, to e[acerbate—the social and sSiritual discontent  that reiJns
here, Ior, at the  ver\  worst, I  would  merel\  have contributed  to the
destruction oI a house I hated, and it  would not  matter iI  I Serished,
too. One has been SerishinJ here so lonJ!
   And what  were the\   thinkinJ  around the  table? “I’ve  come,” said
EliMah, “to Jive \ou somethinJ  which can never be taken awa\  Irom
\ou.”  How solemn the table became then, and how Jreat a liJht  rose
in the dark Iaces! This is the messaJe that has sSread throuJh streets
and tenements and  Srisons, throuJh  the narcotics  wards, and  Sast
the  lth    and  sadism oI  mental  hosSitals to  a  SeoSle Irom  whom
ever\thinJ   has been  taken  awa\,   includinJ,   most cruciall\,    their
sense oI their   own  worth.  3eoSle cannot  live   without  this  sense;
the\  will   do an\thinJ   whatever  to  reJain it.  This  is wh\   the  most
danJerous creation oI  an\  soicet\   is that  man who  has nothinJ  to
lose. You  do not   need ten  such men—one  will   do. And  EliMah, I
should imaJine,  has had  nothinJ  to  lose since the  da\  he  saw his
Iather’s blood rush out—rush down,  and sSlash, so the leJend has it,
down throuJh  the leaves oI a tree, on him. But  neither did  the other
men around  the table  have an\thinJ   to  lose. “Return  to  \our   true
reliJion,”    EliMah has   written.    “Throw    o     the    chains  oI    the
slavemaster, the  devil,  and  return   to  the  Iold.  StoS drinkinJ   his
alcohol,  usinJ   his  doSe—Srotect \our    women—and  Iorsake  the
 lth\     swine.”   I  remembered  m\    buddies  oI   \ears  aJo,   in  the
hallwa\s,   with  their   wine  and  their   whiske\   and  their   tears; in
hallwa\s  still,  Irozen  on  the needle; and  m\   brother  sa\inJ  to  me

51
once, “II  Harlem didn’t  have so man\  churches and Munkies, there’d
be blood  owinJ   in the streets.” ProteFt your women: a di cult  thinJ
to  do  in  a civilization    se[uall\   so  Sathetic  that  the  white  man’s
masculinit\   deSends on a denial  oI  the  masculinit\   oI  the  blacks.
ProteFt your women: in a civilization  that  emasculates the male and
abuses the Iemale, and  in  which,  moreover,  the male  is Iorced  to
deSend on the Iemale’s bread-winninJ Sower. ProteFt your women: in
the teeth oI the  white man’s boast “We   Jure  we’re doinJ  \ou  Iolks
a Iavor  b\  SumSinJ  some white  blood  into  \our   kids,”  and  while
IacinJ the  Southern shotJun and  the Northern  bill\.   Years aJo, we
used to  sa\,  “Yes, I’m   black, Joddammit,   and  I’m  beautiIul!”—in
de ance,  into  the  void.  But now—now—AIrican   kinJs  and heroes
have come into the world,  out  oI the Sast, the Sast that can now  be
Sut to the  uses oI Sower. And black  has beFome a beautiIul color—
not because it is loved but  because it is Ieared. And this  urJenc\  on
the Sart oI  American  NeJroes is not  to be forgotten! As the\  watch
black men  elsewhere rise, the  Sromise held  out,  at  last, that  the\
ma\  walk the earth  with  the authorit\   with  which  white  men walk,
Srotected b\   the  Sower that   white  men  shall  have  no  lonJer,  is
enouJh, and  more  than  enouJh,  to   emSt\  Srisons  and Sull   God
down  Irom  Heaven.  It  has haSSened beIore,  man\   times,  beIore
color  was invented,   and the  hoSe  oI  Heaven has  alwa\s  been  a
metaShor Ior the  achievement oI this  Sarticular  state oI Jrace.  The
sonJ sa\s, “I know m\   robe’s JoinJ to  t   me well. I  tried it  on at the
Jates oI Hell.”
   It  was time to leave, and we stood in the larJe  livinJ  room, sa\inJ
Jood  niJht,  with   ever\thinJ    curiousl\   and  heavil\   unresolved.  I
could not  helS IeelinJ  that  I had  Iailed  a test, in  their  e\es  and in
m\  own, or  that  I had Iailed  to  heed a warninJ.  EliMah and I shook
hands, and  he  asked me  where  I  was JoinJ.   Wherever it   was, I
would  be driven  there—“because, when  we invite   someone here,”
he said, “we take the resSonsibilit\  oI SrotectinJ  him Irom  the white
devils until  he Jets wherever it is he’s JoinJ.”  I was, in Iact, JoinJ  to
have a drink  with  several white  devils  on the other  side oI  town.  I
conIess that Ior a Iraction oI  a second I hesitated to Jive the address
—the kind   oI  address that  in  ChicaJo,  as in   all  American  cities,

52
identi ed  itselI  as a white address b\ virtue  oI  its location. But  I did
Jive it,  and EliMah and I walked  out onto  the steSs, and one oI  the
\ounJ  men vanished to Jet the car. It was ver\  stranJe to stand with
EliMah Ior  those   Iew  moments,   IacinJ   those  vivid,   violent,    so
Sroblematical streets. I  Ielt ver\   close to him,  and reall\   wished  to
be able to love  and honor him  as a witness, an  all\,  and a  Iather. I
Ielt that  I  knew somethinJ  oI  his Sain and his  Iur\,   and, \es,  even
his beaut\.   Yet Srecisel\  because oI  the realit\    and the  nature  oI
those streets—because oI what  he  conceived  as his  resSonsibilit\
and what  I  took  to  be mine—we  would  alwa\s   be stranJers,  and
Sossibl\, one  da\,  enemies. The car  arrived—a JleaminJ,  metallic,
Jrossl\ American  blue—and EliMah and I shook hands and said Jood
niJht once more. He walked into  his mansion and shut the door.
   The driver  and  I started  on our  wa\  throuJh  dark,  murmurinJ—
and, at this  hour,  stranJel\  beautiIul—ChicaJo,  alonJ the  lake. We
returned to  the discussion oI  the land.  How were  we—NeJroes—to
Jet this  land? I asked this  oI the  dark bo\   who had  said earlier,  at
the table, that  the white  man’s actions Sroved him to be a devil.  He
sSoke to me  rst   oI  the  Muslim  temSles that  were beinJ  built,  or
were about to  be built,  in  various Sarts oI the  United States, oI the
strenJth oI the  Muslim  IollowinJ,  and oI  the amount oI  mone\  that
is  annuall\    at  the   disSosal oI   NeJroes—somethinJ  like   twent\
billion  dollars. “That  alone shows \ou  how  stronJ we  are,” he said.
But, I  Sersisted, cautiousl\,   and in  somewhat  di erent   terms,  this
twent\   billion    dollars,  or   whatever  it   is,  deSends on   the  total
econom\ oI  the United  States. What haSSens when the NeJro is no
lonJer a Sart  oI this  econom\?  LeavinJ aside the Iact  that  in order
Ior this  to haSSen the econom\ oI  the United  States will  itselI have
had  to   underJo   radical   and   certainl\    disastrous  chanJes,  the
American NeJro’s sSendinJ Sower  will  obviousl\   no  lonJer  be the
same. On what,  then, will   the  econom\  oI  this seSarate nation  be
based? The bo\ Jave me a rather stranJe look. I  said hurriedl\,  “I’m
not  sa\inJ  it   Fan’t be  done—I  Must want to  know  how  it’s  to  be
done.” I was thinkinJ,  In  order Ior  this to haSSen, \our  entire Irame
oI reIerence will have to chanJe, and \ou  will  be Iorced to surrender
man\ thinJs  that \ou  now  scarcel\ know  \ou  have. I didn’t  Ieel that

53
the thinJs  I had in  mind,  such as the Sseudo-eleJant heaS oI tin in
which we  were ridinJ,  had  an\  ver\  Jreat  value. But  liIe would  be
ver\  di erent   without   them, and  I  wondered iI  he  had thouJht  oI
this.
   How  can one, however, dream  oI Sower in  an\  other  terms than
in the s\mbols  oI Sower? The bo\  could  see that Ireedom deSended
on the  Sossession oI land;  he was  Sersuaded that, in  one  wa\   or
another, NeJroes must achieve this Sossession. In the meantime, he
could walk the  streets and Iear nothinJ, because there were millions
like  him,  cominJ  soon, now,  to  Sower.  He  was held  toJether,  in
short, b\  a dream—thouJh  it  is Must as well to remember that some
dreams come true—and was united with  his “brothers”   on the basis
oI their color.  3erhaSs one cannot ask Ior more. 3eoSle alwa\s seem
to band toJether in  accordance to a SrinciSle that has nothinJ  to do
with    love,    a    SrinciSle    that    releases   them    Irom    Sersonal
resSonsibilit\.
   Yet I  could have hoSed that the Muslim  movement had been able
to inculcate  in the  demoralized NeJro  SoSulation a truer  and more
individual  sense oI its  own worth,  so that  NeJroes in  the Northern
Jhettos could  beJin,  in  concrete terms,  and  at whatever  Srice,  to
chanJe their  situation.  But  in  order to  chanJe a  situation  one has
 rst  to  see it Ior  what  it  is: in  the  Sresent case, to acceSt the Iact,
whatever  one  does with   it   thereaIter,   that  the  NeJro   has been
Iormed b\  this  nation,  Ior better  or Ior  worse, and does not  belonJ
to an\  other—not to  AIrica, and certainl\   not to  Islam. The Sarado[
—and a IearIul  Sarado[ it  is—is that  the American  NeJro can have
no Iuture  an\where,  on an\  continent,  as lonJ as he is unwillinJ   to
acceSt his Sast. To acceSt one’s Sast—one’s histor\—is not the same
thinJ as drowninJ  in it;  it is learninJ  how to  use it. An invented Sast
can never be used; it cracks and crumbles under the Sressures oI liIe
like cla\  in  a season oI drouJht. How can the American NeJro’s Sast
be used? The unSrecedented Srice demanded—and at this embattled
hour oI  the world’s  histor\—is  the  transcendence oI the realities  oI
color, oI nations, and oI altars.
   “An\wa\,”     the   bo\   said  suddenl\,   aIter   a  ver\   lonJ   silence,
“thinJs won’t  ever aJain be the wa\  the\  used to be. I know that.”

54
   And so we arrived in  enem\ territor\,  and the\  set me down at
the enem\’s door.
NO          ONE SEEMS to know where the Nation oI Islam Jets its
mone\. A  vast amount, oI course, is contributed b\   NeJroes, but
there are rumors to the e ect that SeoSle like Birchites and certain
Te[as oil millionaires look with  Iavor on the movement. I have no
wa\ oI  knowinJ whether there is an\  truth  to the  rumors, thouJh
since these SeoSle make such a Soint oI keeSinJ the races seSarate, I
wouldn’t be surSrised iI Ior this smoke there was some  re. In an\
case, durinJ a recent Muslim rall\,   GeorJe Lincoln Rockwell, the
chieI oI  the  American Nazi Sart\,  made a  Soint oI  contributinJ
about twent\  dollars to the cause, and he and Malcolm ;  decided
that, raciall\  sSeakinJ, an\wa\, the\  were in comSlete aJreement.
The Jlori cation   oI one  race and the  conseTuent debasement oI
another—or others—alwa\s has been and alwa\s will be a reciSe Ior
murder. There is no wa\ around this. II one is Sermitted to treat an\
JrouS oI SeoSle with sSecial disIavor because oI their race or the
color oI their skin, there is no limit  to what one will  Iorce them to
endure, and, since the entire race has been m\steriousl\ indicted, no
reason not to attemSt to destro\ it root and branch. This is Srecisel\
what the Nazis attemSted. Their onl\ oriJinalit\   la\  in  the means
the\  used. It is scarcel\ worthwhile  to  attemSt rememberinJ how
man\  times the  sun  has looked  down  on the  slauJhter  oI  the
innocents. I  am  ver\   much  concerned that   American NeJroes
achieve their Ireedom  here in  the  United States. But I  am  also
concerned Ior their diJnit\,  Ior the health oI  their souls, and must
oSSose an\ attemSt that NeJroes ma\ make to do to others what
has been done to them. I think I know—we see it around us ever\
da\—the sSiritual wasteland to which that road leads. It is so simSle
a Iact and one that is so hard, aSSarentl\, to JrasS: Whoever debases
others is debasing himself. That is not a m\stical statement but a most
realistic one, which is Sroved b\ the e\es oI an\ Alabama sheri —
and I would  not like  to see NeJroes ever arrive at so wretched a
condition.

55
   Now, it  is e[tremel\   unlikel\   that  NeJroes will  ever rise to Sower
in the United  States, because the\ are onl\ aSSro[imatel\   a ninth  oI
this nation.  The\   are not  in  the  Sosition oI  the  AIricans, who  are
attemStinJ  to reclaim  their   land and  break  the colonial   \oke  and
recover  Irom   the   colonial    e[Serience.  The   NeJro   situation   is
danJerous in a di erent   wa\,  both  Ior the NeJro  Tua NeJro and Ior
the countr\  oI which  he Iorms so troubled  and troublinJ  a Sart. The
American  NeJro   is  a   uniTue   creation;  he   has  no   counterSart
an\where,  and no  Sredecessors. The Muslims react to  this  Iact  b\
reIerrinJ   to  the   NeJro  as  “the   so-called  American  NeJro”   and
substitutinJ Ior  the names inherited  Irom slaver\  the letter  “;.”   It  is
a Iact   that  ever\   American  NeJro  bears  a  name  that  oriJinall\
belonJed  to  the  white   man  whose  chattel  he  was.  I  am  called
Baldwin because I was either sold b\  m\  AIrican  tribe  or kidnaSSed
out oI  it  into  the  hands oI a  white  Christian  named Baldwin,  who
Iorced me to  kneel at the  Ioot oI  the cross. I am,  then, both  visibl\
and leJall\  the  descendant oI slaves in a white,  3rotestant  countr\,
and this is what it  means to be an American NeJro, this is who  he is
—a kidnaSSed SaJan, who was sold like an animal  and treated like
one, who was once de ned  b\  the  American Constitution  as “three-
 Iths”  oI  a man, and who, accordinJ  to the Dred Scott decision, had
no riJhts   that  a  white  man  was  bound  to  resSect. And  toda\,  a
hundred \ears  aIter  his  technical  emanciSation, he  remains—with
the Sossible e[ceStion  oI  the American  Indian—the  most  desSised
creature in his countr\.   Now, there  is simSl\  no Sossibilit\  oI  a real
chanJe in  the  NeJro’s situation  without   the  most radical  and  Iar-
reachinJ chanJes in the American Solitical  and social structure. And
it  is clear  that  white  Americans are not  simSl\   unwillinJ   to e ect
these chanJes; the\ are, in  the main,  so slothIul  have the\  become,
unable even  to  envision  them.  It   must be  added  that  the  NeJro
himselI no lonJer  believes in the Jood  Iaith oI  white  Americans—iI,
indeed, he ever could have. What  the NeJro has discovered, and on
an international   level,  is  that  Sower  to  intimidate   which   he has
alwa\s had Srivatel\   but hitherto  could maniSulate  onl\  Srivatel\—
Ior Srivate ends oIten,  Ior limited  ends alwa\s.  And  thereIore when
the countr\  sSeaks oI a “new” NeJro, which  it  has been doinJ ever\

56
hour on the hour Ior  decades, it is not reall\  reIerrinJ  to a chanJe in
the NeJro, which,  in an\  case, it is  Tuite incaSable oI assessinJ, but
onl\  to a new  di cult\     in  keeSinJ him in  his Slace, to the Iact  that
it  encounters him  (aJain!   aJain!)  barrinJ   \et  another  door  to  its
sSiritual and  social ease. This is Srobabl\,   hard and  odd as it  ma\
sound, the most  imSortant  thinJ  that  one human beinJ  can do  Ior
another—it is  certainl\  one oI the  most imSortant  thinJs; hence the
torment    and   necessit\    oI   love—and    this    is   the    enormous
contribution  that  the  NeJro  has made  to  this  otherwise  shaSeless
and undiscovered  countr\.   ConseTuentl\,  white  Americans  are  in
nothinJ  more  deluded than  in  suSSosinJ that  NeJroes could  ever
have imaJined that  white  SeoSle would “Jive”   them an\thinJ.   It  is
rare indeed  that   SeoSle Jive.  Most SeoSle Juard  and  keeS; the\
suSSose that it   is  the\   themselves and  what   the\   identiI\    with
themselves that the\  are JuardinJ  and  keeSinJ, whereas what the\
are actuall\   JuardinJ   and  keeSinJ is  their   s\stem  oI  realit\   and
what the\  assume themselves to be. One can Jive nothinJ whatever
without  JivinJ  oneselI—that is to  sa\, riskinJ  oneselI. II  one cannot
risk oneselI, then  one is  simSl\  incaSable oI  JivinJ.  And,  aIter all,
one can Jive Ireedom onl\  b\  settinJ someone Iree. This, in the case
oI the  NeJro, the  American reSublic  has never become su cientl\
mature  to  do.  White  Americans  have  contented  themselves with
Jestures that are  now  described as “tokenism.”   For hard  e[amSle,
white  Americans  conJratulate   themselves on   the  1954  SuSreme
Court decision  outlawinJ  seJreJation in  the  schools; the\  suSSose,
in sSite oI  the mountain  oI  evidence that has since accumulated to
the contrar\,   that  this was SrooI  oI a  chanJe oI heart—or,  as the\
like to  sa\,  SroJress. 3erhaSs. It all  deSends on how one reads the
word “SroJress.” Most oI the NeJroes I know do not  believe that this
immense concession would ever have been made iI  it  had not been
Ior the  comSetition  oI  the Cold  War, and  the  Iact that  AIrica  was
clearl\  liberatinJ  herselI  and thereIore had, Ior  Solitical  reasons, to
be wooed b\  the  descendants oI her Iormer  masters. Had it  been a
matter  oI  love  or   Mustice, the 1954  decision  would   surel\   have
occurred  sooner;  were  it  not   Ior   the  realities  oI   Sower  in  this
di cult    era, it miJht  ver\  well  not have occurred \et.  This seems an

57
e[tremel\  harsh wa\  oI statinJ  the case—unJrateIul, as it were—but
the evidence that suSSorts this wa\ oI statinJ  it is not  easil\ reIuted.
I m\selI  do not  think  that  it can be reIuted  at all.  In an\   event, the
sloSS\ and Iatuous nature oI American Jood will  can never be relied
uSon to deal with  hard Sroblems. These have been dealt with, when
the\  have been dealt  with  at  all, out  oI  necessit\—and in  Solitical
terms, an\wa\,   necessit\  means concessions made in order  to sta\
on toS. I think  this is a Iact, which  it  serves no SurSose to den\, but,
whether it is a faFt or not, this is what the blaFk SoSulation of the world,
inFluding blaFk AmeriFans, really believe. The word “indeSendence” in
AIrica   and   the    word   “inteJration”     here   are   almost    eTuall\
meaninJless; that is, EuroSe has not  \et  leIt  AIrica,  and black  men
here  are  not   \et   Iree.   And  both   oI   these  last  statements  are
undeniable Iacts,  related Iacts,  containinJ  the  Jravest imSlications
Ior us all.  The NeJroes oI this  countr\  ma\   never be able to  rise to
Sower, but the\  are ver\ well  Slaced indeed to SreciSitate chaos and
rinJ down the  curtain on the American dream.
   This  has  ever\thinJ   to  do,  oI   course, with   the  nature  oI  that
dream and with  the  Iact  that we  Americans, oI  whatever color,  do
not dare e[amine  it and are Iar  Irom havinJ  made it a realit\.   There
are too   man\   thinJs  we  do  not   wish  to  know   about  ourselves.
3eoSle are not,  Ior   e[amSle,  terribl\   an[ious   to  be eTual  (eTual,
aIter all,  to  what  and  to  whom?)  but the\   love  the  idea oI  beinJ
suSerior. And  this   human  truth  has  an  esSeciall\  JrindinJ   Iorce
here, where identit\   is almost imSossible to  achieve and SeoSle are
SerSetuall\  attemStinJ  to   nd   their   Ieet on  the  shiItinJ   sands oI
status.  (Consider  the   histor\   oI   labor   in   a  countr\    in   which,
sSirituall\   sSeakinJ, there are  no workers,  onl\   candidates Ior  the
hand oI  the boss’s dauJhter.) Furthermore,  I  have met  onl\  a  ver\
Iew SeoSle—and most oI these were  not Americans—who  had an\
real desire to  be Iree.  Freedom is hard  to  bear. It  can be  obMected
that I  am  sSeakinJ oI Solitical   Ireedom in  sSiritual  terms,  but the
Solitical  institutions   oI  an\   nation   are  alwa\s  menaced  and  are
ultimatel\   controlled  b\   the  sSiritual  state oI  that  nation.  We are
controlled  here b\  our  conIusion, Iar  more than  we know,  and the
American  dream   has  thereIore   become  somethinJ   much  more

58
closel\   resemblinJ  a   niJhtmare,   on  the   Srivate,  domestic,  and
international  levels. 3rivatel\,    we cannot  stand our  lives  and dare
not e[amine  them;  domesticall\,  we take  no resSonsibilit\   Ior (and
no Sride in)  what  Joes on  in our  countr\;   and, internationall\,    Ior
man\  millions  oI  SeoSle, we are an unmitiJated   disaster. Whoever
doubts this  last statement has  onl\  to  oSen his ears, his  heart, his
mind, to  the testimon\  oI—Ior  e[amSle—an\  Cuban Seasant or an\
SSanish Soet, and ask himselI what he would Ieel about us iI he were
the victim  oI  our  SerIormance in  Sre-Castro Cuba or in  SSain. We
deIend our curious role  in SSain b\  reIerrinJ  to the Russian menace
and the necessit\ oI SrotectinJ  the Iree world.  It has not occurred to
us that  we have  simSl\  been  mesmerized b\  Russia, and  that  the
onl\  real  advantaJe Russia has  in  what  we think   oI as  a struJJle
between the East and the  West is the  moral histor\   oI the  Western
world.  Russia’s secret weaSon is the bewilderment and desSair and
hunJer  oI  millions  oI  SeoSle oI  whose  e[istence  we  are scarcel\
aware. The  Russian  Communists are  not   in  the  least  concerned
about these SeoSle. But our iJnorance and  indecision have had  the
e ect,  iI   not  oI  deliverinJ   them  into  Russian hands,  oI  SlunJinJ
them ver\  deeSl\  in the Russian shadow, Ior which  e ect—and  it  is
hard to blame them—the most articulate  amonJ them,  and the most
oSSressed as well, distrust us all the more.  Our Sower and our  Iear
oI chanJe helS bind these SeoSle to their miser\  and bewilderment,
and insoIar  as  the\    nd   this  state intolerable   we  are  intolerabl\
menaced. For iI the\   nd   their state intolerable,  but  are too heavil\
oSSressed to chanJe it, the\ are simSl\  Sawns in the hands oI larJer
Sowers, which,  in   such a  conte[t,   are  alwa\s  unscruSulous,  and
when, eventuall\,   the\  do  chanJe their  situation—as  in  Cuba—we
are menaced  more  than  ever,   b\   the  vacuum  that  succeeds all
violent  uSheavals. We should certainl\   know b\   now that  it  is one
thinJ to  overthrow  a dictator  or reSel an invader  and Tuite another
thinJ reall\   to achieve a  revolution.  Time and time  and time  aJain,
the SeoSle discover that the\  have merel\  betra\ed  themselves into
the hands oI  \et  another  3haraoh, who,  since he  was necessar\ to
Sut the  broken  countr\    toJether,  will   not  let   them  Jo.  3erhaSs,
SeoSle beinJ the  conundrums  that  the\   are,  and  havinJ  so little

59
desire to shoulder the burden  oI their  lives, this  is what will   alwa\s
haSSen. But at the bottom oI  m\  heart I  do not believe  this. I  think
that SeoSle can be better than  that,  and I know  that  SeoSle can be
better than the\  are. We are caSable oI bearinJ a Jreat burden, once
we discover  that the  burden  is realit\   and  arrive  where realit\    is.
An\wa\,   the Soint here is that we  are livinJ  in an aJe oI revolution,
whether we will  or  no, and that  America is the onl\   Western nation
with  both the  Sower and, as I  hoSe to suJJest, the e[Serience  that
ma\  helS to  make these revolutions  real  and minimize  the  human
damaJe. An\  attemSt we make to  oSSose these outbursts oI enerJ\
is tantamount to siJninJ  our death warrant.
   Behind what  we think   oI as the Russian menace lies what  we do
not wish  to Iace, and what  white  Americans do not  Iace when the\
reJard a  NeJro:  realit\—the   Iact  that   liIe  is  traJic.  LiIe  is  traJic
simSl\ because the earth turns and the sun ine[orabl\   rises and sets,
and one da\,  Ior  each oI us, the  sun will  Jo  down Ior  the  last, last
time. 3erhaSs the whole  root  oI our  trouble,  the human  trouble,  is
that  we  will   sacri ce   all  the   beaut\  oI   our  lives,  will   imSrison
ourselves  in   totems,  taboos,  crosses,  blood   sacri ces,   steeSles,
mosTues, races, armies,  aJs, nations,  in  order to  den\  the  Iact  oI
death, which is the onl\   Iact we have. It seems to me that one ouJht
to reMoice in the faFt oI death—ouJht to decide, indeed, to earn one’s
death b\   conIrontinJ   with  Sassion the  conundrum  oI  liIe.  One  is
resSonsible to liIe: It  is the  small beacon in that  terriI\inJ    darkness
Irom  which   we  come  and  to  which   we  shall  return.   One must
neJotiate this SassaJe as nobl\ as Sossible, Ior the sake oI those who
are cominJ  aIter us. But  white  Americans do  not  believe in  death,
and this  is wh\   the darkness oI  m\  skin  so intimidates  them.  And
this is also wh\   the Sresence oI the NeJro in this  countr\  can brinJ
about its destruction.  It is the resSonsibilit\   oI Iree men to trust  and
to  celebrate   what   is   constant—birth,   struJJle,   and   death   are
constant, and so is love, thouJh we ma\ not  alwa\s think  so—and to
aSSrehend the nature oI chanJe, to be able and willinJ   to chanJe. I
sSeak oI chanJe not on the surIace but in the deSths—chanJe in the
sense oI renewal. But  renewal becomes imSossible iI  one suSSoses
thinJs to be constant that are not—saIet\,  Ior e[amSle,  or mone\,  or

60
Sower. One  clinJs  then  to  chimeras,  b\   which  one  can  onl\   be
betra\ed,  and  the  entire  hoSe—the entire  Sossibilit\—oI   Ireedom
disaSSears. And b\  destruction I  mean Srecisel\  the  abdication  b\
Americans oI an\  e ort   reall\  to  be Iree. The NeJro can SreciSitate
this  abdication  because white  Americans  have never,  in  all  their
lonJ  histor\,  been  able to  look  on  him  as a man  like  themselves.
This Soint need not be  labored; it  is Sroved over and over  aJain b\
the NeJro’s continuinJ  Sosition here, and  his indescribable struJJle
to deIeat the  strataJems that  white  Americans have used, and use,
to den\  him  his humanit\.   America  could have used in  other  wa\s
the enerJ\ that  both JrouSs have e[Sended in this con ict.   America,
oI  all   the  Western  nations,  has  been  best  Slaced to   Srove  the
uselessness and the obsolescence oI the conceSt oI color. But it has
not dared to acceSt this oSSortunit\,   or even to conceive oI  it as an
oSSortunit\.  White  Americans  have  thouJht  oI  it  as their   shame,
and have envied those more civilized  and eleJant  EuroSean nations
that were untroubled  b\  the  Sresence oI black men on their  shores.
This  is  because  white   Americans  have  suSSosed “EuroSe”  and
“civilization”   to  be s\non\ms—which   the\  are not—and  have been
distrustIul oI  other standards and other sources oI vitalit\,  esSeciall\
those Sroduced in America  itselI, and  have attemSted to  behave in
all  matters as thouJh  what  was  east Ior  EuroSe was also  east Ior
them. What it comes to is that  iI we, who can scarcel\  be considered
a white nation,  Sersist in thinkinJ   oI ourselves as one, we condemn
ourselves, with   the   trul\    white   nations,  to  sterilit\     and  deca\,
whereas iI we could acceSt ourselves as we are, we miJht brinJ new
liIe to  the Western achievements, and transIorm  them. The Srice oI
this transIormation  is the  unconditional  Ireedom oI  the NeJro;  it  is
not too  much to  sa\  that  he, who  has been so lonJ  reMected, must
now be embraced, and at  no matter what  Ss\chic  or social risk.  He
is the ke\  Jure   in his countr\,   and the American  Iuture is Srecisel\
as briJht   or  as dark  as his.  And  the  NeJro  recoJnizes this,   in  a
neJative wa\.  Hence the Tuestion: Do I  reall\  want to  be inteJrated
into a burninJ  house?
   White  Americans  nd  it  as di cult    as white  SeoSle elsewhere do
to  divest themselves oI  the  notion   that  the\   are in  Sossession oI

61
some intrinsic   value  that   black  SeoSle need,  or  want.   And  this
assumStion—which, Ior  e[amSle,  makes the solution  to  the  NeJro
Sroblem deSend on the sSeed with which NeJroes acceSt and adoSt
white  standards—is  revealed in   all  kinds  oI  strikinJ   wa\s,   Irom
Bobb\  Kenned\’s  assurance that a NeJro  can become 3resident  in
Iort\   \ears  to  the  unIortunate   tone oI  warm   conJratulation  with
which so man\   liberals address their  NeJro eTuals. It  is the NeJro,
oI course, who is Sresumed to have become eTual—an achievement
that not  onl\   Sroves the  comIortinJ  Iact  that  Serseverance has no
color but also overwhelminJl\   corroborates the white man’s sense oI
his own value.  Alas, this value  can scarcel\  be corroborated in  an\
other wa\;  there is  certainl\  little  enouJh  in the  white man’s Sublic
or Srivate  liIe that  one should  desire to imitate.   White men,  at the
bottom oI  their  hearts, know  this.  ThereIore, a  vast amount oI  the
enerJ\  that Joes into  what  we call  the  NeJro Sroblem is  Sroduced
b\  the white  man’s SroIound  desire not to  be MudJed b\ those who
are not white,  not  to  be seen as he is, and at the  same time a  vast
amount oI  the  white  anJuish is  rooted in  the  white  man’s eTuall\
SroIound need to be seen as he is, to be released Irom the t\rann\ oI
his mirror.  All  oI  us know, whether  or  not we  are able to  admit it,
that mirrors  can onl\   lie,  that death  b\  drowninJ  is  all that  awaits
one there. It is Ior  this reason that love  is so desSeratel\ souJht and
so cunninJl\   avoided.  Love  takes o     the masks  that  we  Iear  we
cannot live without  and know  we cannot live  within.  I use the word
“love”  here not merel\  in  the Sersonal sense but as a state oI beinJ,
or a  state oI  Jrace—not  in  the  inIantile   American  sense oI beinJ
made haSS\  but   in  the  touJh  and  universal  sense oI  Tuest  and
darinJ and Jrowth.  And  I submit,  then, that  the racial  tensions that
menace Americans toda\  have little   to  do with   real antiSath\—on
the  contrar\,    indeed—and  are  involved   onl\    s\mbolicall\     with
color. These tensions are  rooted in  the  ver\   same deSths as those
Irom which  love sSrinJs, or murder.  The white  man’s unadmitted—
and aSSarentl\, to him,  unsSeakable—Srivate Iears and lonJinJs are
SroMected onto the NeJro. The onl\ wa\ he can be released Irom the
NeJro’s  t\rannical   Sower   over  him   is  to   consent,  in  e ect,    to
become black   himselI,  to   become  a  Sart  oI  that   su erinJ    and

62
dancinJ countr\   that he  now watches wistIull\    Irom  the heiJhts  oI
his lonel\  Sower  and, armed with  sSiritual  traveller’s  checks, visits
surreStitiousl\  aIter dark.  How can one resSect, let alone adoSt, the
values oI a SeoSle who do not, on  an\  level whatever,  live the  wa\
the\  sa\ the\   do, or  the wa\  the\  sa\  the\  should? I  cannot acceSt
the SroSosition that  the  Iour-hundred-\ear   travail  oI the  American
NeJro should result  merel\  in his  attainment oI  the Sresent level oI
the  American  civilization.    I   am  Iar   Irom  convinced   that  beinJ
released Irom the AIrican  witch  doctor was worthwhile   iI I  am now
—in  order  to  suSSort the  moral   contradictions  and  the  sSiritual
aridit\   oI m\  liIe—e[Sected  to  become deSendent on the American
Ss\chiatrist.  It  is  a barJain  I  reIuse.  The onl\   thinJ  white   SeoSle
have that black SeoSle need, or should want,  is Sower—and no one
holds Sower  Iorever.  White   SeoSle cannot,  in  the  Jeneralit\,    be
taken as models oI how to  live.  Rather, the white  man is himselI  in
sore  need  oI  new   standards, which   will    release  him  Irom   his
conIusion and Slace him once aJain in  IruitIul  communion  with  the
deSths oI his own beinJ. And  I reSeat: The Srice oI the liberation  oI
the white SeoSle is the liberation  oI the blacks—the total  liberation,
in the cities, in  the towns, beIore the law,  and in the mind.  Wh\,  Ior
e[amSle—esSeciall\ knowinJ   the Iamil\   as I  do—I  should want  to
marr\  \our   sister  is a  Jreat  m\ster\   to  me.  But \our   sister  and I
have ever\ riJht  to  marr\  iI  we wish to,  and no one has the riJht  to
stoS us. II she cannot raise me to her level, SerhaSs I can raise her to
mine.
   In short,  we, the black and the white,  deeSl\ need each other here
iI  we are  reall\   to  become a  nation—iI  we  are  reall\,   that  is, to
achieve our  identit\,   our  maturit\,   as men  and women.  To  create
one nation   has Sroved  to  be  a  hideousl\   di cult     task;  there  is
certainl\  no  need now to  create two, one  black and one white.  But
white men with  Iar  more Solitical  Sower than that  Sossessed b\ the
Nation  oI  Islam  movement have  been advocatinJ  e[actl\    this,  in
e ect,  Ior   Jenerations. II   this  sentiment  is honored  when  it   Ialls
Irom the  liSs oI Senator B\rd,  then  there is no  reason it should  not
be honored  when  it   Ialls  Irom   the  liSs  oI  Malcolm  ;.    And  an\
ConJressional committee wishinJ  to investiJate  the latter  must also

63
be willinJ  to investiJate  the Iormer.  The\  are e[SressinJ e[actl\  the
same sentiments and  reSresent e[actl\   the  same danJer.  There is
absolutel\   no  reason  to   suSSose that   white   SeoSle  are  better
eTuiSSed to Irame the laws b\ which I  am to be Joverned than I am.
It  is  entirel\    unacceStable  that  I   should  have  no   voice  in  the
Solitical a airs   oI m\  own  countr\,  Ior  I am not a ward  oI America;
I am one oI the  rst  Americans to arrive  on these shores.
   This  Sast,  the  NeJro’s  Sast,  oI   roSe,  re,    torture,   castration,
inIanticide,  raSe; death and humiliation;  Iear b\  da\  and niJht,  Iear
as deeS as the marrow oI the bone; doubt that he was worth\  oI liIe,
since ever\one around him  denied it;  sorrow  Ior his women,  Ior his
kinIolk,  Ior  his children,  who  needed his Srotection,  and whom  he
could not Srotect; raJe, hatred, and murder, hatred Ior  white men so
deeS that it   oIten  turned  aJainst him  and  his  own,  and made  all
love, all  trust, all  Mo\ imSossible—this Sast, this endless struJJle to
achieve and reveal and con rm  a human  identit\,   human authorit\,
\et  contains,  Ior  all  its horror,   somethinJ ver\   beautiIul.  I  do  not
mean to be sentimental about su erinJ—enouJh  is certainl\  as Jood
as a Ieast—but  SeoSle who cannot  su er  can  never Jrow  uS,  can
never discover who  the\  are.  That man  who  is Iorced each  da\  to
snatch his manhood,  his identit\,    out oI  the   re  oI  human  cruelt\
that raJes to  destro\  it  knows, iI  he survives his e ort,   and  even iI
he does not survive it,  somethinJ about himselI  and human liIe that
no school on earth—and, indeed, no church—can teach. He achieves
his own authorit\,   and  that is unshakable. This  is because, in order
to save his  liIe,  he is  Iorced  to look  beneath  aSSearances, to take
nothinJ Ior  Jranted, to hear the  meaninJ behind the words. II  one is
continuall\   survivinJ  the  worst  that  liIe  can brinJ,  one  eventuall\
ceases to be controlled b\  a Iear oI  what liIe  can brinJ;  whatever it
brinJs must be borne. And at this level oI e[Serience one’s bitterness
beJins to  be  Salatable, and  hatred  becomes too  heav\   a sack  to
carr\.  The  aSSrehension oI  liIe   here so  brie \    and  inadeTuatel\
sketched has been the e[Serience oI  Jenerations oI NeJroes, and  it
helSs to e[Slain  how  the\   have endured  and how  the\  have  been
able to Sroduce children oI  kinderJarten  aJe who can walk  throuJh
mobs to  Jet  to  school. It  demands Jreat  Iorce  and  Jreat  cunninJ

64
continuall\   to  assault the  miJht\   and indi erent    Iortress oI  white
suSremac\,  as  NeJroes  in   this   countr\   have   done  so  lonJ.   It
demands Jreat sSiritual resilience not to hate the hater whose Ioot is
on \our  neck, and an even Jreater miracle oI  SerceStion and charit\
not to  teach \our   child  to hate.  The NeJro bo\s  and  Jirls  who are
IacinJ mobs toda\  come out oI  a lonJ line  oI imSrobable aristocrats
—the onl\  Jenuine aristocrats this  countr\  has Sroduced. I sa\  “this
countr\”   because their   Irame  oI  reIerence was  totall\    American.
The\  were  hewinJ  out   oI  the  mountain  oI  white   suSremac\  the
stone oI  their  individualit\.     I  have  Jreat  resSect Ior  that  unsunJ
arm\  oI  black men and  women who  trudJed  down  back lanes and
entered back doors, sa\inJ   “Yes, sir”  and “No,  Ma’am”  in  order  to
acTuire a new rooI Ior the schoolhouse, new books, a new chemistr\
lab, more beds Ior  the dormitories,  more  dormitories.  The\  did not
like  sa\inJ  “Yes, sir”  and  “No  Ma’am,”  but the  countr\   was in  no
hurr\  to  educate NeJroes, these black  men and  women knew  that
the Mob had to be done, and the\ Sut  their Sride  in their  Sockets in
order to  do it.  It  is ver\  hard  to believe  that the\   were in  an\  wa\
inIerior  to the white  men and women who oSened those back doors.
It is  ver\  hard  to believe  that  those men and women,  raisinJ  their
children,  eatinJ   their  Jreens,  cr\inJ    their   curses, weeSinJ  their
tears, sinJinJ their  sonJs, makinJ their  love,  as the sun rose, as the
sun set, were in an\  wa\  inIerior  to the  white men and women  who
creSt over to share these sSlendors aIter the sun went down. But we
must avoid the  EuroSean error; we  must not  suSSose that, because
the situation,  the wa\s,  the SerceStions oI black SeoSle so radicall\
di ered   Irom  those  oI  whites,  the\   were  raciall\    suSerior. I   am
Sroud oI these SeoSle not because oI their color but because oI their
intelliJence  and their  sSiritual  Iorce and  their  beaut\.  The countr\
should be  Sroud oI  them,  too,  but,  alas, not  man\   SeoSle in this
countr\   even  know   oI  their   e[istence.  And   the  reason  Ior  this
iJnorance is that  a knowledJe oI  the role  these SeoSle Sla\ed—and
Sla\—in   American   liIe   would    reveal   more  about   America   to
Americans than Americans wish to know.
   The  American  NeJro  has the  Jreat  advantaJe  oI  havinJ   never
believed that  collection  oI  m\ths  to  which  white  Americans  clinJ:

65
that their  ancestors were all  Ireedom-lovinJ  heroes, that  the\  were
born  in   the  Jreatest  countr\    the  world   has  ever  seen, or   that
Americans are invincible in  battle and wise in Seace, that Americans
have alwa\s   dealt  honorabl\   with   Me[icans  and  Indians  and  all
other  neiJhbors  or  inIeriors,  that   American  men  are the  world’s
most direct   and  virile,   that  American  women  are  Sure.  NeJroes
know Iar  more  about white  Americans  than that;  it  can  almost be
said, in Iact, that  the\  know  about white  Americans what Sarents—
or, an\wa\,   mothers—know about their  children, and that  the\  ver\
oIten reJard  white  Americans that  wa\.  And  SerhaSs this attitude,
held in sSite oI  what the\  know  and have endured, helSs to e[Slain
wh\    NeJroes,  on   the   whole,   and   until   latel\,     have  allowed
themselves to  Ieel so  little   hatred. The  tendenc\  has  reall\   been,
insoIar as this  was Sossible, to dismiss white  SeoSle as the sliJhtl\
mad victims oI  their own  brainwashinJ.  One watched the lives the\
led. One  could  not  be Iooled  about  that;  one watched  the  thinJs
the\  did  and the e[cuses that  the\  Jave themselves, and iI  a white
man was reall\  in  trouble,  deeS trouble, it  was to  the NeJro’s door
that  he came. And  one  Ielt  that  iI  one had  had that   white  man’s
worldl\   advantaJes, one  would  never have  become as bewildered
and as Mo\less and as thouJhtlessl\ cruel as he. The  NeJro came to
the white  man  Ior  a  rooI  or Ior   ve   dollars  or  Ior  a letter  to  the
MudJe; the white man came to  the  NeJro Ior  love.  But he  was not
oIten able to Jive  what he came seekinJ. The Srice was too hiJh; he
had too  much  to  lose.  And the  NeJro  knew  this,  too.  When  one
knows this  about a  man, it  is  imSossible Ior  one to  hate him,  but
unless he becomes a man—becomes eTual—it is also imSossible Ior
one  to  love   him.  Ultimatel\,     one  tends  to  avoid   him,   Ior  the
universal characteristic  oI  children   is to  assume that  the\   have a
monoSol\  on trouble,  and  thereIore  a monoSol\  on  you. (Ask  an\
NeJro what he knows about  the white  SeoSle with whom he works.
And  then  ask the  white  SeoSle with   whom  he  works  what  the\
know about him.)
   How  can the American NeJro  Sast be used? It is entirel\  Sossible
that this  dishonored Sast will  rise uS soon to  smite all  oI us.  There
are some wars,  Ior  e[amSle  (iI   an\one  on  the  Jlobe  is still   mad

66
enouJh to  Jo  to  war)  that  the  American  NeJro  will   not  suSSort,
however man\  oI his SeoSle ma\ be coerced—and there is a limit  to
the number oI SeoSle an\ Jovernment  can Sut in Srison, and a riJid
limit  indeed to  the Sracticalit\   oI such a course. A bill  is  cominJ in
that  I  Iear America  is  not  SreSared to  Sa\.  “The  Sroblem  oI  the
twentieth  centur\,”   wrote W.  E. B. Du Bois around  si[t\   \ears  aJo,
“is the  Sroblem oI  the  color line.”   A IearIul  and  delicate Sroblem,
which  comSromises, when  it   does not  corruSt,  all   the  American
e orts  to  build  a  better world—here,   there, or  an\where.  It  is  Ior
this reason that  ever\thinJ   white   Americans think  the\   believe  in
must now  be reë[amined.  What one  would not  like  to  see aJain is
the consolidation  oI SeoSles on the basis oI their  color. But  as lonJ
as we in the  West Slace on color the  value that  we do,  we make it
imSossible  Ior   the   Jreat   unwashed   to   consolidate   themselves
accordinJ to an\  other SrinciSle.  Color is not a human or  a Sersonal
realit\;  it  is a  Solitical  realit\.  But  this is a  distinction  so e[tremel\
hard to make that  the West has not been able to make it \et.  And at
the center oI this dreadIul storm,  this vast conIusion, stand the black
SeoSle oI this nation, who  must now  share the Iate oI a nation  that
has never  acceSted them, to  which   the\  were  brouJht  in   chains.
Well, iI  this is so, one has no choice  but to  do all in  one’s Sower to
chanJe   that    Iate,    and    at    no   matter     what    risk—eviction,
imSrisonment,  torture,   death.  For  the  sake oI  one’s  children,   in
order to  minimize  the bill   that they must  Sa\,  one must be  careIul
not  to take  reIuJe  in  an\   delusion—and the  value  Slaced on  the
color oI the  skin is alwa\s  and ever\where  and Iorever a delusion.  I
know that  what  I  am  askinJ is  imSossible. But  in  our  time,  as in
ever\  time,  the imSossible  is the  least that  one can  demand—and
one is, aIter  all,  emboldened b\   the sSectacle oI human  histor\   in
Jeneral, and American NeJro  histor\  in  Sarticular,  Ior it  testi es  to
nothinJ less than the SerSetual achievement oI the imSossible.
   When  I  was ver\   \ounJ,   and  was dealinJ   with  m\   buddies  in
those wine- and urine-stained hallwa\s,  somethinJ  in me wondered,
What will  haSSen to all that beauty? For black SeoSle, thouJh  I  am
aware that some oI us, black and white, do not  know it  \et,  are ver\
beautiIul. And when  I sat at EliMah’s table and watched the bab\, the

67
women,  and  the  men,  and  we  talked  about  God’s—or  Allah’s—
venJeance, I wondered,  when  that venJeance was  achieved, What
will  haSSen to  all   that  beauty  then?  I   could  also   see that   the
intransiJence and  iJnorance  oI  the  white  world   miJht  make  that
venJeance inevitable—a venJeance that does not reall\   deSend on,
and cannot reall\   be e[ecuted  b\,  an\   Serson or orJanization,  and
that  cannot be  Srevented b\   an\   Solice Iorce  or  arm\:   historical
venJeance, a cosmic venJeance, based on the law that we recoJnize
when we  sa\, “Whatever  Joes uS must  come down.”  And  here we
are, at the center oI  the arc, traSSed in the Jaudiest,  most valuable,
and  most   imSrobable   water   wheel  the   world    has  ever   seen.
Ever\thinJ  now,  we must assume, is in our hands; we have no riJht
to  assume  otherwise.   II   we—and   now   I   mean   the  relativel\
conscious whites and the relativel\  conscious blacks, who must, like
lovers, insist on,  or create, the  consciousness oI the others—do not
Ialter in  our dut\  now,  we ma\  be able, handIul  that we are, to  end
the  racial  niJhtmare,   and  achieve  our  countr\,    and  chanJe  the
histor\   oI   the  world.    II  we   do  not   now   dare  ever\thinJ,    the
Iul llment   oI  that SroShec\,  re-created Irom the  Bible in  sonJ b\  a
slave, is uSon us: God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, the
 re next time!

                                    BLUES FOR MISTER CHARLIE

In a small  Southern town,  a white  man murders  a black man,  then
throws  his bod\   in  the  weeds. With   this  act oI  violence  Baldwin
launches an unsSarinJ and at times  aJonizinJ  Srobe oI the wounds
oI race. For where once a white storekeeSer could have shot a “bo\”
like Richard  Henr\  with  imSunit\,   times have chanJed. In  Blues for

71

subMects, the Sossibilit\ oI an AIrican-American  Sresident and what
it miJht  mean; the h\Socris\   oI American reliJious  Iundamentalism;
the black  church  in   America;  the  trials  and  tribulations   oI  black

bracinJ,  The  Cross of   RedemStion is  a  welcome  and   imSortant
addition  to  the  works  oI  a cosmoSolitan  and canonical  American

Man 
and  his   Symbols 
conceived and edited by 
Carl  G.Jung

    The first and only work in which  Carl 
    G. Jung, the world-famous Swiss psy-
    chologist, explains to the general reader 
    his greatest contribution to our knowl-
    edge of the human mind: the theory of 
    the importance of symbolism—particu-
    larly  as revealed in dreams. 

Man                    and                   his 
Symbols 
Carl                  G.Jung 


    But for a dream, this book would never 
    have been written.  That  dream — de-
     scribed by John Freeman in the Fore-
     word—convinced Jung that he could, 
     indeed should, explain his ideas to those 
     who have no special knowledge of psy-
     chology. At   the  age of  eighty-three, 
     Jung worked out the complete plan for 
     this book, including  the  sections that 
     he wished his four closest associates to 
     write.  He devoted the closing months 
     of his life to editing the work and writ-
     ing his own key section, which he com-
     pleted only ten  days before his death. 
         Throughout the book, Jung empha-
     sizes that man can achieve wholeness 
     only through a knowledge and accept-
     ance of the unconscious—a knowledge 
     acquired  through   dreams and  their 
      symbols. Every dream is a direct, per-
     sonal, and meaningful communication 
      to the dreamer—a communication that 
      uses the symbols common to all man-
      kind but uses them always in an entire-
      ly individual  way, which can be inter-
      preted only by  an entirely  individual 
       key.

Introduction:               John       Freeman 







The origins  of this  book  are sufficiently  unusual  to  be of interest,   and 
they bear a direct  relation  to  its contents and  what it  sets out to do. So 
let me tell  you just  how it  came to  be written. 
    One day in  the spring  of  1959 the British  Broadcasting  Corporation 
invited  me  to  interview   for  British  television   Dr.  Carl  Gustav  Jung. 
The interview   was to be done "in  depth."   I  knew little   enough at  that 
time about Jung and his work, and  I at once went to make his acquaint-
ance at his beautiful lakeside home near Zurich. That  was the beginning 
of a friendship  that  meant  a great  deal to  me and,  I  hope, gave  some 
pleasure to Jung  in  the  last years of  his life.  The  television   interview 
has no further place in this story, except that  it was accounted successful 
and that  this book  is by an odd  combination   of circumstances an  end-
product  of that  success. 
    One man who  saw Jung on the screen was Wolfgang  Foges, manag-
ing director   of Aldus  Books.  Foges had been keenly  interested  in  the 
development of modern  psychology since his childhood,   when he lived 
near the Freuds in  Vienna.  And  as he watched Jung  talking  about  his 
life and  work  and  ideas, Foges suddenly  reflected  what  a pity   it  was 
that,  while   the  general  outline  of  Freud's   work  was  well  known   to 
educated readers all over the Western  world, Jung  had never  managed 
to break through   to the general  public  and  was always considered too 
difficult  for  popular   reading. 
    Foges, in fact,  is the  creator  of Man  and his Symbols. Having sensed 
from  the TV   screen  that  a  warm  personal  relation   existed  between 
Jung and  myself, he asked me whether   I  would join   him  in  trying   to 
persuade Jung to set out some of his more important   and basic ideas in 
language and at  a length  that  would  be intelligible    and interesting   to 
non-specialist adult  readers. I jumped  at the idea and  set off once more 
to  Zurich,  determined   that   I  could  convince  Jung  of  the value   and 
importance  of such a work.  Jung  listened  to me in  his garden  for  two 
hours almost without  interruption   — and then said no.  He said it in  the 
nicest possible way, but  with  great  firmness;  he had  never in  the past 
tried to popularize   his work,  and he wasn't  sure that  he could  success-
fully do  so now; anyway,   he was old and  rather  tired  and  not keen to 
take on such a long commitment   about  which  he had so many doubts. 

   Jung's  friends  will   all  agree  with   me that   he  was a  man  of  most 
positive decision. He would  weigh  up a problem  with  care and without 


                                                                                                                                               9

                              hurry;   but when  he did give his answer, it  was usually  final. I  returned 
                              to London  greatly  disappointed,  but  convinced  that Jung's  refusal was 
                              the end  of the matter.   So it  might  have been, but  for  two  intervening 
                              factors that  I  had not   foreseen. 
                                  One was the pertinacity   of Foges, who insisted  on making  one more 
                              approach  to Jung before accepting defeat. The other  was an event that, 
                              as I look  back on  it, still  astonishes me. 
                                  The  television program  was, as I  have said, accounted successful. It 
                              brought  Jung  a  great  many  letters  from  all  sorts of  people, many  of 
                              them ordinary  folk  with  no medical  or psychological  training,  who  had 
                              been captivated   by  the  commanding   presence,  the humor,   and   the 
                              modest charm   of this  very  great  man,  and  who  had glimpsed  in   his 
                              view of  life and  human personality  something  that  could  be helpful  to 
                              them.  And  Jung  was  very  pleased, not  simply  at  getting  letters   (his 
                              mail  was enormous at  all times)  but  at getting  them  from  people who 
                              would  normally   have no contact  with  him. 
                                  It   was at  this  moment   that  he  dreamed  a  dream  of  the  greatest 
                              importance  to  him.  (And   as you read  this book,  you  will   understand 
                             just  how  important   that  can  be.)  He dreamed  that,  instead  of  sitting 
                              in his study and  talking  to the great  doctors and psychiatrists  who used 
                              to call  on  him  from   all  over  the world,   he  was standing  in  a  public 
                              place and  addressing a multitude   of people who  were listening  to  him 
                              with  rapt  attention  and  understanding what he said. . . . 
                                  When,  a  week or  two  later,   Foges renewed  his request  that  Jung 
                              should undertake  a new  book designed, not  for the clinic  or  the philo-
                              sopher's study,  but  for  the people  in  the  market  place, Jung  allowed 
                              himself to  be persuaded.  He laid  down  two  conditions.  First,  that  the 
                              book should  not  be a single-handed   book, but  the  collective  effort  of 
                              himself  and  a group   of  his closest followers,   through  whom   he  had 
                              attempted  to perpetuate  his methods and his teaching. Secondly, that  I 
                              should be entrusted with  the  task of co-ordinating  the work  and resolv-
                              ing  any   problems  that   might    arise  between  the   authors  and    the 
                              publishers. 
                                  Lest it  should seem that this  introduction   transgresses the bounds of 
                              reasonable modesty,  let  me  say at  once  that  I  was  gratified  by   this 
                              second condition — but  within   measure. For  it  very  soon came to  my 
                              knowledge  that Jung's  reason for  selecting me  was essentially that  he

regarded me as being of  reasonable, but  not  exceptional,   intelligence 
and without  the slightest  serious knowledge of psychology.  Thus I  was 
to Jung the  "average  reader"   of this  book;  what  I   could  understand 
would be intelligible    to all  who  would   be interested;  what  I   boggled 
at might  possibly be too difficult   or obscure for  some. Not unduly    flat-
tered by this estimate  of my  role, I  have none the  less scrupulously in-
sisted (sometimes, I fear, to the exasperation  of the authors)  on  having 
every paragraph   written   and,  if  necessary, rewritten    to  a degree  of 
clarity  and directness that  enables me to say with   confidence that  this 
book in its entirety  is designed for and addressed to the general  reader, 
and that the  complex subjects it  deals with  are treated with  a rare  and 
encouraging simplicity. 
   After  much  discussion, the  comprehensive  subject of  this  book was 
agreed to be  Man  and  his Symbols;  and Jung   himself selected as his 
collaborators in  the work  Dr.  Marie-Louise   von  Franz of  Zurich,   per-
haps his closest professional confidante and friend;  Dr. Joseph  L.  Hen-
derson of San  Francisco,  one  of  the  most prominent    and  trusted  of 
American Jungians;   Mrs.  Aniela  Jaffe  of Zurich,   who,  in  addition   to 
being an experienced analyst, was Jung's confidential   private  secretary 
and his biographer;    and Dr.  Jolande  Jacobi,  who  after  Jung  himself 
is the most experienced author  among Jung's Zurich   circle. These  four 
people were chosen partly  because of their  skill  and  experience in  the 
particular  subjects  allocated  to  them  and  partly   because all of  them 
were completely trusted  by Jung  to work  unselfishly  to his instructions 
as members of a team. Jung's   personal responsibility   was to  plan  the 
structure  of the  whole  book,  to  supervise and  direct   the work   of his 
collaborators, and  himself to write  the keynote  chapter,  "Approaching 
the Unconscious." 

    The last year of his life was devoted almost  entirely  to this book,  and 
when he died in June   1961, his own section was complete  (he  finished 
it, in fact,  only some 10 days before his final  illness) and his  colleagues' 
chapters had all  been approved   by him  in  draft.   After  his death,  Dr. 
von Franz   assumed over-all  responsibility   for  the  completion   of  the 
book in accordance with Jung's express instructions. The subject  matter 
of Man  and his  Symbols and its  outline   were  therefore   laid   down— 
and in  detail—by  Jung.  The  chapter  that  bears  his name is his  work 
and  (apart from  some fairly   extensive editing   to improve  its  intelligi-


                                                                                                                                               11

                              bility   to the general reader)  nobody  else's. It was written,   incidentally, 
                              in  English. The remaining  chapters were written   by the various authors 
                              to Jung's  direction  and  under  his supervision.  The  final  editing  of  the 
                              complete  work after Jung's  death has been done by Dr. von  Franz  with 
                              a patience,  understanding,   and good  humor  that  leave the  publishers 
                              and  myself greatly  in her  debt. 
                                  Finally   as to the contents of  the book itself: 
                                  Jung's  thinking   has colored  the world   of modern  psychology  more 
                              than  many of those with casual knowledge  realize. Such familiar   terms, 
                              for  instance,   as  "extravert,"     "introvert,"     and   "archetype"    are   all 
                             Jungian   concepts—borrowed  and sometimes misused by others. But his 
                              overwhelming   contribution   to  psychological understanding   is his con-
                              cept  of the  unconscious—not  (like  the  unconscious of  Freud)   merely 
                              a sort of glory-hole  of repressed desires, but a world that  is just as much 
                              a  vital   and  real  part   of  the  life   of  an  individual    as the  conscious, 
                              "cogitating"     world  of  the  ego, and  infinitely    wider  and  richer.   The 
                              language  and  the  "people"   of  the unconscious  are symbols,  and  the 
                              means of communications   dreams. 
                                  Thus an  examination  of  Man  and his Symbols is in  effect an exami-
                              nation  of  man's relation   to  his own  unconscious. And  since in  Jung's 
                              view  the  unconscious  is  the  great  guide,  friend,   and  adviser  of  the 
                              conscious, this book  is related  in  the most direct  terms  to the  study of 
                              human  beings and their  spiritual   problems.  We know  the unconscious 
                              and  communicate  with  it  (a  two-way  service) principally    by  dreams; 
                              and  all through   this  book  (above all  in Jung's  own  chapter)  you  will 
                              find  a quite remarkable   emphasis placed on the importance   of dream-
                              ing in  the life  of the  individual. 
                                  It  would   be  an impertinence   on  my   part  to  attempt   to  interpret 
                             Jung's  work  to readers,  many  of whom  will  surely be far  better  quali-
                              fied  to understand   it  than  I  am.  My   role,  remember,  was merely  to 
                              serve as a sort  of "intelligibility       filter"  and  by  no means as an  inter-
                              preter.  Nevertheless,  I  venture  to  offer  two  general points  that   seem 
                              important   to me as a layman and  that may  possibly be helpful to  other 
                              non-experts. The  first  is about dreams. To Jungians  the dream  is not a 
                              kind  of  standardized  cryptogram   that   can be  decoded by  a  glossary 
                              of symbol meanings.  It  is an integral,  important,   and  personal expres-
                              sion  of the  individual    unconscious.  It  is just   as "real"    as any  other 


I 2

phenomenon    attaching     to   the  individual.       The,  dreamer's     individual 
unconscious   is communicating      with   the  dreamer   alone   and  is selecting 
symbols   for   its  purpose    that    have   meaning    to   the   dreamer    and    to 
nobody  else. Thus   the  interpretation      of dreams,   whether   by  the  analyst 
or by   the  dreamer   himself,    is for   the Jungian     psychologist    an  entirely 
personal  and  individual      business  (and  sometimes   an  experimental     and 
very  lengthy    one   as  well)    that   can   by   no  means   be  undertaken      by 
rule  of  thumb. 
    The  converse   of  this  is  that   the  communications      of  the  unconscious 
are of  the  highest   importance     to  the  dreamer—naturally        so, since   the 
unconscious  is  at least  half   of his  total   being—and    frequently    offer   him 
advice  or guidance    that  could   be obtained    from   no other   source.   Thus, 
when  I  described  Jung's    dream   about   addressing   the  multitude,     I  was 
not  describing    a  piece   of  magic    or  suggesting    that  Jung    dabbled    in 
fortune  telling.    I  was recounting    in  the  simple  terms   of daily   experience 
how  Jung    was  "advised"      by   his  own    unconscious    to  reconsider     an 
inadequate  judgment     he had  made   with   the conscious   part  of his   mind. 

    Now  it  follows   from   this  that  the  dreaming    of  dreams  is not   a  matter 
that   the   well-adjusted      Jungian     can    regard    as  simply    a   matter    of 
chance.  On  the  contrary,     the ability    to  establish   communications      with 
the  unconscious    is  a  part   of   the   whole   man,   and   Jungians     "teach" 
themselves   (I  can  think    of  no  better   term)    to  be receptive    to  dreams. 
When,   therefore,    Jung    himself1  was  faced   with    the   critical     decision 
whether   or not   to write   this  book,   he was  able  to draw   on  the  resources 
of both   his conscious   and  his  unconscious   in  making    up  his mind.    And 
all  through    this  book  you   will   find   the  dream   treated   as a  direct,    per-
sonal, and  meaningful     communication      to the  dreamer   —a  communica-
tion  that   uses the symbols   common    to ajl   mankind,    but   that  uses  them 
on every  occasion  in  an  entirely   individual      way  that  can  be  interpreted 
only  by  an  entirely    individual      "key." 

    The  second  point   I  wish   to make  is  about   a particular     characteristic 
of argumentative     method   that   is common    to all  the  writers   of  this  book 
    perhaps  to  all Jungians.    Those  who  have  limited    themselves   to  living 
entirely   in   the  world   of  the  conscious   and   who  reject    communication 
with   the unconscious    bind   themselves   by  the  laws  of conscious,    formal 
life.  With    the  infallible     (but   often   meaningless)    logic   of  the  algebraic 
equation,    they  argue  from   assumed  premises   to incontestably      deduced 


                                                                                                                                                              '3

                              conclusions. Jung and his colleagues seem to me (whether they  know it 
                              or not)  to  reject  the limitations   of  this method   of argument.   It  is not 
                              that they  ignore logic, but  they appear  all the  time to be arguing  to the 
                              unconscious as well as to the conscious. Their dialectical method is itself 
                              symbolic and  often  devious. They  convince  not  by  means of the  nar-
                              rowly  focused spotlight of  the syllogism,  but by  skirting,  by  repetition, 
                              by presenting a recurring  view  of the same subject seen each time from 
                              a slightly   different   angle — until suddenly   the  reader  who  has never 
                              been aware of  a single,  conclusive moment  of  proof  finds that  he  has 
                              unknowingly   embraced and  taken into  himself  some wider  truth. 
                                 Jung's  arguments  (and  those of  his colleagues) spiral   upward  over 
                              his subject like  a bird  circling   a tree.  At  first,  near the ground,   it  sees 
                             only  a confusion of  leaves and branches. Gradually,   as it circles higher 
                              and  higher,  the  recurring   aspects of  the  tree form   a wholeness  and 
                              relate  to their  surroundings.   Some readers  may find   this  "spiraling" 
                              method  of argument  obscure  or even  confusing for  a few  pages—but 
                              not,  I  think,  for  long.  It  is  characteristic  of Jung's  method,  and  very 
                              soon the reader  will   find  it  carrying  him  with   it  on a persuasive  and 
                              profoundly  absorbing  journey. 
                                 The  different   sections of this book speak for  themselves and require 
                              little  introduction   from  me. Jung's  own chapter  introduces  the  reader 
                              to the unconscious, to  the archetypes and  symbols that  form its  langu-
                              age and to  the  dreams by  which  it  communicates.  Dr.  Henderson  in 
                              the following   chapter  illustrates  the appearance  of several  archetypal 
                              patterns  in ancient   mythology,  folk  legend,  and  primitive   ritual.   Dr. 
                             von   Franz,  in  the  chapter  entitled   "The   Process of  Individuation," 
                              describes the  process by   which   the  conscious and   the  unconscious 
                              within   an individual    learn  to  know,  respect,  and  accommodate  one 
                              another.  In  a certain  sense this chapter  contains  not only  the  crux  of 
                              the whole  book,  but  perhaps the  essence of Jung's philosophy  of life: 
                              Man  becomes whole, integrated,   calm,  fertile,  and  happy  when  (and 
                              only  when)  the  process of individuation     is complete,  when  the  con-
                             scious and  the unconscious have  learned  to live  at peace and  to com-
                              plement  one  another.  Mrs.  Jaffe,   like  Dr.   Henderson,  is  concerned 
                              with   demonstrating,   in  the  familiar    fabric   of  the  conscious,  man's 
                              recurring  interest  in—almost   obsession with — the symbols of the  un-
                              conscious. They have for  him  a profoundly   significant,  almost a  nour-

ishing   and   sustaining,     inner    attraction   — whether     they   occur   in   the 
myths  and  fairy   tales  that  Dr.   Henderson   analyzes   or  in  the visual   arts, 
which,   as Mrs.  Jaffe   shows,  satisfy  and  delight    us by  a constant    appeal 
to  the  unconscious. 
    Finally,    I  must   say  a brief   word   about    Dr.  Jacobi's    chapter,    which 
is somewhat   separate   from   the  rest  of  the  book.   It   is in  fact  an   abbre-
viated  case history   of  one  interesting    and  successful  analysis.  The   value 
of such  a chapter   in  a book   like  this  is obvious;    but  two   words  of  warn-
ing  are nevertheless   necessary.   First,  as Dr.   von  Franz   points  out,   there 
is no  such thing    as a typical   Jungian    analysis.   There   can't   be,   because 
every  dream   is  a private    and   individual     communication,       and  no   two 
dreams  use  the  symbols   of the   unconscious   in  the  same  way.   So  every 
Jungian   analysis   is unique   — and  it  is  misleading    to  consider    this  one, 
taken  from   Dr.   Jacobi's   clinical     files  (or  any  other   one   there  has  ever 
been),  as "representative"       or  "typical."       All   one  can  say of  the  case of 
Henry    and   his   sometimes   lurid     dreams   is   that   they   form    one   true 
example   of  the  way   in  which    the Jungian     method   may   be  applied    to 
a  particular     case.  Secondly,    the  full   history    of  even   a  comparatively 
uncomplicated    case would   take  a whole  book  to  recount.   Inevitably,     the 
story  of Henry's    analysis  suffers  a  little   in  compression.    The   references, 
for  instance,   to  the  /  Ching  have  been  somewhat    obscured   and  lent   an 
unnatural     (and  to  me unsatisfactory)      flavor  of  the  occult   by being   pre-
sented out  of  their   full  context.    Nevertheless,   we  concluded—and      I  am 
sure  the  reader    will   agree  — that,   with   the   warnings    duly    given,   the 
clarity,     to  say   nothing     of   the   human    interest,    of   Henry's     analysis 
greatly   enriches   this  book. 

    I   began  by  describing    how  Jung   came  to  write   Man   and his  Symbols. 
I  end  by  reminding    the  reader   of what   a remarkable    — perhaps   unique 
—publication      this  is. Carl   Gustav  Jung   was  one  of the  great   doctors  of 
all  time  and  one  of the  great   thinkers   of  this  century.   His   object   always 
was to  help  men  and  women   to  know   themselves,   so that  by   self-know-
ledge and  thoughtful     self-use  they  could  lead  full,   rich,  and  happy   lives. 
At   the very   end  of  his  own   life,  which    was  as full,   rich,   and  happy    as 
any   I   have   encountered,      he  decided    to   use  the   strength     that    was 
left   him   to  address   his  message  to   a  wider    public    than   he  had   ever 
tried   to  reach   before.   He  completed     his  task  and   his  life  in   the  same 
month.    This  book   is his  legacy  to  the  broad   reading    public.

Rorschach. The shape of the blot

da Vinci wrote in his Notebooks:

stop sometimes and look into the 
stains of walls, or ashes of a fire, 
or clouds, or mud or like places, 
in which ... you may find really

preferred  to  the  stick,   or  the  stick   to  the  ram.

    From  this line  of  reasoning,   I  concluded    that 
only the material    that  is clearly   and  visibly   part

When,   in  conversation,    I  use any  such  terms   as 
"'state,"     "money,"      "health,"      or   "society,"      I 
assume  that   my   listeners   understand     more   or 
less the same thing  as I  do. But  the  phrase   "more 
or  less"   makes   my    point.    Each   word     means 
something   slightly   different   to each  person,  even 
among  those  who  share  the same  cultural     back-
ground.   The   reason   for  this  variation     is that    a 
general   notion    is  received    into   an    individual 
context  and  is therefore   understood   and   applied 
in  a slightly   individual     way.   And  the   difference 
of  meaning    is  naturally     greatest   when    people 
have  widely   different    social,   political,     religious 
or  psychological     experiences. 

    As  long   as concepts   are  identical    with    mere 
words,  the variation    is almost  imperceptible      and 
plays  no  practical    role.  But  when  an  exact   defi-
nition    or  a  careful   explanation     is  needed,   one 
can   occasionally     discover    the   most    amazing 
variations,     not  only    in  the   purely    intellectual 
understanding     of  the  term,   but   particularly      in 
its emotional    tone  and  its application.     As a  rule, 
these  variations     are  subliminal      and    therefore 
never  realized.                                      v 

    One   may  tend   to  dismiss  such  differences    as 
redundant    or   expendable    nuances  of   meaning 
that  have  little   relevance   to everyday   needs.  But 
the  fact  that  they  exist  shows that   even the   most 
matter-of-fact     contents   of  consciousness  have   a 
penumbra    of   uncertainty     around    them.    Even 
the    most   carefully     defined     philosophical       or 
mathematical     concept,   which    we are  sure  does 
not   contain   more   than   we   have  put   into   it,   is 
nevertheless    more    than    we   assume.    It    is   a

He isn't pretending to be a lion; 
he is convinced that he is a lion. 
Like the Nyanga tribesman and his 
bird mask (p. 25), he shares a 
"psychic identity"' with the animal— 
an identity that exists in the realm 
of myth and symbolism. Modern 
"rational" man has tried to cut 
himself off from such psychic 
associations (which nevertheless 
survive in the unconscious); to 
him, a spade is a spade and a lion

Left, two influences to which an 
individual's consciousness is 
subjected: Advertising (a 1 960s 
American advertisement stressing 
"sociability") and political 
propaganda (a French poster for 
a 1962 referendum, urging a vote 
of "yes" but plastered with the 
opposition's "no"). These and other 
influences may cause us to live 
in ways unsuited to our individual 
natures: and the psychic imbalance 
that can follow must be compensated 
for by the unconscious.

a cartoon by America's Roland B

a little disturbed psychologically

in its compensatory function, has

    For    the  sake   of  mental    stability      and   even 
physiological     health,    the  unconscious    and   the 
conscious  must  be integrally    connected   and  thus

     Of  course,   people   are   bound    to  query    this

anatomy   offish    and   my  mother   ran  a  hotel   for 
ghostly   visitors.    Usually    this   unfamiliar      guest 
wing   was  an  ancient    historical     building,      long 
forgotten,    yet   my   inherited     property.     It    con-
tained  interesting    antique   furniture,    and  toward 
the  end  of  this  series of  dreams  I  discovered    an 
old  library    whose   books  were  unknown    to   me. 
Finally,    in  the  last  dream,    I  opened  one  of   the 
books  and   found   in  it   a  profusion    of  the   most 
marvelous    symbolic    pictures.    When    I   awoke, 
my  heart   was  palpitating     with    excitement. 

    Some   time   before   I  had   this  particular      last 
dream  of  the  series,  I  had  placed  an  order   with 
an antiquarian      bookseller   for  one  of  the  classic 
compilations      of   medieval     alchemists.     I    had 
found   a quotation     in  literature     that   I   thought 
might   have  some connection    with   early    Byzan-
tine  alchemy,   and   I  wished  to  check  it.   Several 
weeks  after    I  had   had   the   dream    of  the    un-
known   book,   a  parcel   arrived    from    the   book-
seller.  Inside    was  a parchment     volume    dating 
from   the    16th  century.     It    was  illustrated      by 
fascinating    symbolic   pictures    that   instantly    re-
minded    me  of  those  I   had  seen  in  my   dream. 
As the  rediscovery    of  the  principles    of  alchemy 
came  to  be an  important     part   of  my  work   as  a 
pioneer   of  psychology,    the   motif   of  my    recur-
ring    dream    can    easily    be   understood.      The 
house,  of  course,   was  a  symbol   of  my    person-
ality  and   its conscious   field  of interests;    and  the 
unknown   annex   represented   the  anticipation     of 
a new  field  of interest   and  research   of which    my 
conscious  mind  was  at that  time   unaware.    From 
that   moment,     30  years   ago,  I   never   had    the 
dream   again.

The "compass" of the psyche— 
another Jungian way of looking at 
people in general. Each point on the 
compass has its opposite: for a 
"thinking" type, the "feeling" side 
would be least developed. ("Feeling" 
here means the faculty of weighing 
and evaluating experience—in the 
way that one might say "I feel that is 
a good thing to do," without needing 
to analyze or rationalize the "why" 
of '.he action.) Of course, there is 
overlapping in each individual: In 
a "sensation" person the thinking 
or the feeling side could be almost 
as strong (and "intuition," the 
opposite, would be weakest).

in  which   he  had  seen  a drunken    tramp    rolling            dreams   were   clearly    compensating     for  an   in-

how   low  a  man   can  fall."    It   was  evident    that          was  asking,   to  have   such  illustrious    callers?    In 
the   unpleasant     nature    of   the   dream    was   at          this  respect  the  dreams  pointed    to a secret  meg-
least  in   part   an   attempt    to   offset   his   inflated 
opinion   of  his  own  merits.   But   there  was  some-
thing   more   to   it  than   this.   It   turned    out    that 
he  had  a  brother    who   was  a  degenerate    alco-
holic.   What    the  dream   also  revealed    was  that 
his   superior     attitude     was   compensating       the 
brother,    as both   an  outer   and  an  inner    figure. 

    In   another    case I   recall,   a  woman   who   was 
proud     of    her    intelligent       understanding        of 
psychology   had  recurringdreams     about   another 
woman.    When    in   ordinary      life   she  met    this 
woman,    she  did   not   like   her,    thinking     her   a 
vain  and  dishonest   intriguer.     But  in  the  dreams 
the  woman   appeared   almost  as a sister,   friendly 
and  likeable.    My   patient   could   not   understand 
why   she  should    dream    so  favorably     about    a 
person  she disliked.    But  these  dreams  were   try-
ing   to   convey    the   idea   that    she  herself    was 
"shadowed"      by  an  unconscious   character     that 
resembled    the  other    woman.    It   was   hard    for 
my  patient,    who  had  very  clear  ideas  about   her 
own   personality,    to  realize   that   the  dream   was 
telling    her  about   her  own   power   complex    and

appear in the dreams of a man who 
felt himself to be superior to 
others. In this way his unconscious 
would be compensating for his 
conscious mind's onesidedness.

monster" motif in the girl's first 
dream (p. 70). 



The girl's second dream—of angels 
in hell and demons in heaven— 
seems to embody the idea of the 
relativity of morality. The same 
concept is expressed in the dual 
aspect of the fallen angel who is 
both Satan, the devil, and (right) 
Lucifer, the resplendent bringer 
of light. These opposites can also 
be seen in the figure of God, far

a cloven hoof like a demon's.

beyond   their   limited     existence.    It  gives   them

    Myths    go   back   to  the   primitive      storyteller 
and  his  dreams,   to  men   moved   by  the   stirring 
of  their   fantasies.   These   people   were  not   very 
different     from    those  whom    later     generations 
have   called    poets   or   philosophers.      Primitive 
storytellers     did   not    concern    themselves    with 
the  origin    of  their   fantasies;   it   was very    much 
later    that   people    began    to  wonder     where   a 
story   originated.     Vet.    centuries    ago,  in    what 
we  now   call    "ancient""     Greece,   men's    minds 
were   advanced     enough    to   surmise    that     the 
tales   of   the   gods   were   nothing      but    archaic 
and exaggerated    traditions     of   long-buried     kings 
or  chieftains.    Men   already    took   the  view    that 
the  myth   was  too  improbable     to  mean   what   it 
said.   They    therefore    tried    to   reduce    it   to   a 
generally   understandable      form. 

    In  more   recent  times,   we have  seen  the  same 
thing     happen    with     dream     symbolism.       We 
became   aware,   in   the  years  when    psychology 
was   in   its    infancy,     that    dreams     had    some 
importance.     But  just   as  the  Greeks   persuaded 
themselves   that  their    myths  were   merely   elab-
orations    of   rational     or   "normal"       history,    so 
some of  the  pioneers  of  psychology    came  to  the 
conclusion   that  dreams  did   not  mean  what   they 
appeared   to mean.   The  images  or  symbols   that 
they  presented   were  dismissed   as bizarre    forms 
in   which     repressed    contents     of   the    psyche 
appeared   to  the  conscious    mind.   It   thus   came 
to  be   taken   for  granted     that   a  dream    meant 
something   other   than   its obvious    statement. 

    I   have   already   described    my    disagreement 
with    this   idea — a  disagreement      that   led    mc 
to  study    the   form    as  well   as   the   content    of 
dreams.    Why    should     they   mean     something 
different     from    their    contents?    Is   there    any-
thing    in  nature    that    is other    than   it   is?   The          Above, a child's drawing of a tree

    This  modern    standpoint    is  surely    one-sided 
and  unjust.   It   does  not   even  accord    with    the 
known  facts.  Our   actual   knowledge    of  the   un-
conscious shows that  it  is a natural    phenomenon 
and  that,    like    Nature     herself,    it   is   at   least 
neutral. It  contains   all  aspects  of  human    nature 
    light  and  dark,   beautiful    and  ugly,  good   and 
evil, profound   and silly.   The  study  of individual, 
as well  as of  collective,    symbolism     is an   enor-
mous task, and  one  that   has not   yet been   mast-
ered. But   a  beginning    has   been  made   at  last. 
The  early    results   are  encouraging,      and   they 
seem to indicate    an  answer  to  many   so  far  un-
answered questions   of  present-day     mankind.

bols   have  played    in  the   life  of  many    different 
cultures,    the  more   one  understands    that    there 
is  also a  re-creative    meaning    in  these  symbols. 
    Some   symbols    relate   to  childhood     and    the 
transition     to   adolescence,   others   to    maturity, 
and   others  again   to  the   experience   of  old   age, 
when   man  is preparing    for  his inevitable     death. 
Dr.  Jung   has described   how  the dreams   of a girl 
of  eight    contained    the   symbols   one   normally 
associates  with   old   age.  Her  dreams    presented 
aspects of  initiation     into  life  as belonging    to  the 
same archetypal    pattern   as initiation    into   death. 
This    progression    of  symbolic    ideas   may    take 
place,   therefore,    within    the  unconscious     mind 
of   modern    man   just    as  it   took   place   in    the 
rituals   of  ancient   societies. 

    This  crucial   link  between   archaic  or  primitive 
myths   and   the   symbols   produced     by  the   un-
conscious  is of immense   practical   importance     to 
the  analyst.    It   enables   him   to  identify    and   to 
interpret    these  symbols   in  a  context   that   gives 
them  historical    perspective   as well   as psycholo-
gical   meaning.     I  shall   now    take  some   of   the 
more   important     myths   of  antiquity      and   show 
how — and   to  what    purpose  — they   are   analo-
gous to  the  symbolic    material    that   we  encoun-
ter  in  our  dreams.

England's Stonehenge (seen below

     Usually,     in   mythology,      the   hero   wins    his 
battle    against   the   monster.    (I   shall   say   more 
about    this  in   a  moment.)    But   there   are  other 
hero   myths   in   which    the  hero   gives  in   to   the 
monster.    A  familiar     type  is  that   of Jonah    and 
the  whale,   in  which   the  hero  is  swallowed   by  a 
sea  monster    that   carries    him   on   a   night    sea 
journey    from  west  to  east, thus  symbolizing     the 
supposed    transit     of   the   sun   from    sunset    to 
dawn.     The    hero   goes   into    darkness,    which 
represents   a kind   of death.    I  have  encountered 
this   theme    in   dreams    presented    in   my    own          The ego's emergence can be

clinical    experience.                                                               sacrifice: death leading to rebirth.

     The   son   in   the   dream    is   the   man's    own 

youthful    ego,  which   had  frequently    felt   threat-

ened  by  the  shadow   in   the  form   of  self-doubt. 

He  had,   in  a sense, waged   a successful   crusade 

against   this  adversary   all  his  mature   life.   Now, 

partly    through     the   actual    encouragement      of 

seeing his son  grow  up  without   such  doubts,   but 

mainly   by  forming    a suitable   image   of the   hero 

in   the  form   closest   to  his  own    environmental 

pattern,    he  finds  it  no longer   necessary  to   fight 

the  shadow;    he  can  accept   it.   That   is  what   is 

symbolized    in   the  act   of  friendship.     He   is  no 

longer  driven   to  a competitive    struggle   for  indi-

vidual   supremacy,    but  is assimilated    to the  cul-

tural   task  of forming    a  democratic    sort  of  com-

munity.    Such  a conclusion,    reached   in  the  full-

ness  of  life,   goes  beyond    the  heroic    task   and 

leads  one  to a  truly   mature    attitude. 

     This   change,   however,    does  not   take   place 

automatically.      It  requires  a period   of transition, 

which    is expressed   in  the  various    forms  of   the 

archetype    of  initiation.

wc sec how   the  power  of  the  original    archetype 

can   never   be   permanently      overcome,    in   the 

manner    envisaged   by   the  hero-dragon      battle, 

without    a crippling    sense ol  alienation    from   the 

fruitful     powers  of  the   unconscious.    We  saw  in 

the   myth    of   the   Twins    how   their    hybris,  ex-

pressing  excessive  ego-Self  separation,    was  cor-

rected   by  their    own   fear  of  the   consequences, 

which   forced  them  back  into   a harmonious    ego-

Self  relation. 

    In   tribal   societies   it  is the  initiation     rite   that 

most  effectively    solves this  problem.    The   ritual 

takes   the  novice    back   to  the   deepesl   level   ol 

original    mother-child     identity    or  ego-Self  iden-

tity,   thus  forcing    him  to  experience    a symbolic 

death.    In  other    words,   his   identity     is  tempo-

rarily   dismembered   or dissolved   in the  collective 

unconscious.    From    this  state   he  is  then    cere-

monially    rescued   by  the   rite  ol   the  new   birth. 

 This  is the  first   act  of  true  consolidation     ol  the 

ego with    the  larger   group,   expressed  as  totem, 

clan,  or  tribe,   or  all   three   combined. 

    The    ritual,     whether     it   is   found    in    tribal 

groups  or  in  more  complex   societies,   invariably 

insists upon  this  rite  of death   and  rebirth,    which 

provides    the   novice   with    a  "rite    of   passage" 

from  one  stage  of  life  to  the   next,  whether    it  is 

from  early  childhood     to later  childhood    or  from 

early    to   late   adolescence    and    from    then   to 

maturity.

Primitive initiation rituals bring 
the youth into adulthood and into 
the tribe's collective identity. In 
many primitive societies, initiation 
is accomplished by circumcision (a 
symbolic sacrifice). Here are four

Australian aborigines. Far left.top

under blankets (a symbolic death 
from which they will be reborn). 
Bottom, they are removed and held 
by the men for the actual operation. 
Left, the circumcised boys are 
given men's conical caps, a mark of 
their new status. Right, they are 
finally isolated from the tribe to 
be purified and given instruction.

(he  individual       participant       is  different.       The 

Dionysiac   participant      looks  back   to  the  origin

is blasted   from   the  resistant    womb   of   Mother 

Earth.   In  the  frescoes of  the  Villa   de  Misteri    in

mask of  terror   reflected   in  the  cup   of  Dionysus

ciple of  breeding    and  growth. 

    In  contrast    to   this   backward    look,   with    its 

central  focus  on  nature's    eternal   cycle  of   birth 

and  death,    the  Christian     mystery    points    for-

formal  religious   conventions  followed   by   her 
family.  Yet  the  symbolic  events of  the  church 
year and  the  richness of her  insight  into   their 
meaning  remained   with   her   throughout    the 
process of her psychological change; and in  her 
analysis  I  found   this   working   knowledge   of 
religious symbolism  most  helpful. 

   The   significant  elements  she singled  out  of 
her  fantasy  were  the  white   cloth,  which   she 
understood  as a  sacrificial  cloth;    the  vaulted 
room, which  she considered to  be a tomb;  and 
her commitment,  which  she associated with the 
experience of submission. This commitment,   as 
she called it, suggested a ritual of initiation  with 
a perilous descent into the vault of death,  which 
symbolized  the  way  she had  left  church   and 
family  to  experience God  in  her  own  fashion. 
She had undergone an "imitation    of Christ"   in 
the true  symbolic  sense, and like  him  she  had 
suffered the  wounds  that  preceded this  death. 

    The  sacrificial    cloth  suggests the   winding 
sheet or  shroud  in  which  the  crucified   Christ 
was wrapped and then  placed in the tomb.  The 
end of the fantasy introduces  the healing  figure 
of  a  man,  loosely  associated with   me  as  her 
analyst  but  appearing  also in  his  natural   role 
as a friend   fully  aware  of  her  experience.  He 
speaks to her in words she cannot yet  hear, but 
his  hands are  reassuring  and  give  a  sense of 
healing. One  senses in this figure the touch and 
the  word  of  the   good  shepherd,  Orpheus  or 
Christ,   as  mediator   and   also,  of  course,   as 
healer. He  is on the  side of life and  has to con-
vince  her  that  she may  now  come  back  from 
the vault  of  death. 

    Shall  we  call   this  rebirth   or   resurrection? 
Both, perhaps, or neither. The  essential rite pro-
claims  itself  at   the  end:  The   cool  breeze  or 
water  flowing  over  her body  is the   primordial 
act  of  purification    or  cleansing  of  the  sin   of 
death,  the essence of true baptism. 

    The   same woman   had  another   fantasy  in 
which  she felt  that  her  birthday   fell  upon  the 
day  of  Christ's  resurrection.   (This   was  much 
more  meaningful   for  her than   the memory   of 
her  mother,  who  had never given  her  the feel-

despair   of  life,   should   in  some  way   herald    her

merely    for  those   who  sought    to  live   life   more 

abundantly;      it  was  also  used  as a   preparation 

for   death,   as  if  death   also   required    an   initia-

tory   rite  of  passage of  the  same  kind.

relates  to our  own   predicament.    Yet   it  becomes 

easier  when   we   realize    it  is  only    the   specific-

forms   of  these   archaic    patterns    that    change, 

not  their   psychic   meaning. 

    We  have   been  talking    of  wild   birds   as  sym-

bols of release  or  liberation.    But  today   we  could 

as well   speak  of  jet   planes   and   space  rockets, 

for  they   are   the   physical    embodiment     of   the 

same transcendent    principle,     freeing   us at  least 

temporarily     from  gravity.     In  the  same  way  the 

ancient   symbols    of  containment,      which     once 

gave  stability     and   protection,     now   appear    in 

modern    man's    search   for   economic     security 

and social   welfare. 

    Any   of  us can   see, of  course,   that   there  is  a 

conflict   in our   lives between   adventure    and  dis-

cipline,    or   evil    and   virtue,     or   freedom     and 

security.   But   these  are  only   phrases  we   use  to 

describe  an  ambivalence     that   troubles   us,  and 

to which   we  never  seem able  to  find  an  answer. 

    There   is an answer.    There  is a meeting    point 

between   containment     and   liberation,      and   we 

can  find  it  in   the  rites  of  initiation     that   I   have 

been discussing.   They   can   make  it  possible   for 

individuals,    or  whole  groups   of people,   to  unite 

the   opposing     forces   within      themselves     and 

achieve  an  equilibrium      in  their   lives. 

    But   the  rites   do   not   offer   this    opportunity 

invariably,      or  automatically.        They    relate    to 

particular    phases in  the  life  of  an individual,      or 

of a group,   and  unless  they  are  properly    under-

stood and   translated   into   a new  way   oflife,    the 

moment    can  pass.   Initiation      is,  essentially,    a 

process  that   begins   with   a  rite   of   submission, 

followed   by  a period   of  containment,     and   then 

by a further    rite  of liberation.     In   this way   every 

individual    can reconcile   the conflicting     elements 

of his  personality:     He can  strike   a balance    that 

makes him   truly    human,    and  truly    the   master 

of  himself. 





In the dreams and fantasies of many 
modern people, the flights of the 
great rockets of space research 
have often appeared as symbolic 
20th-century embodiments of the 
urge toward liberation and release 
that is called transcendence.

The  process   of   individuation 


The    pattern      of   psychic       growth 






At  the  beginning  of  this book  Dr.  C.  G.  Jung 
introduced  the reader  to the concept of  the un-
conscious, its personal and collective structures, 
and its symbolic  mode of expression. Once  one 
has seen the vital importance  (that  is, the  heal-
ing or  destructive  impact)   of the  symbols pro-
duced  by  the  unconscious,  there remains   the 
difficult  problem  of interpretation.   Dr. Jung has 
shown that everything  depends on whether  any 
particular   interpretation   "clicks"   and is  mean-
ingful  to the individual    concerned. In  this  way                                       Below, a "meander" (a decoration

is the purpose  of the  total dream  life of  the  in-
dividual?   What  role do  dreams play,  not  only 
in  the immediate   psychic  economy of  the  hu-
man being,  but  in his life  as a whole? 

    By observing a great many people and study-
ing  their  dreams  (he estimated   that  he  inter-
preted at least 80,000 dreams), Jung discovered 
not only  that all dreams are relevant  in  varying 
degrees to the life of the dreamer,  but that  they 
are all  parts of  one great web  of  psychological 
factors, fcle also found that,  on  the whole,  they 
seem to follow an arrangement  or pattern.  This 
pattern  Jung called  "the   process of individua-
tion."   Since  dreams  produce  different   scenes 
and  images every  night,   people  who  are  not 
careful  observers will  probably   be unaware  of 
any  pattern.    But  if   one  watches  one's   own 
dreams over  a period  of  years and studies  the 
entire  sequence, one will  see that certain   con-
tents  emerge,  disappear,   and   then  turn    up 
again.  Many  people even dream  repeatedly  of 
the same figures, landscapes, or situations;  and 
if one follows  these through a whole  series, one 
will see that they change slowly but perceptibly. 
These changes can be accelerated if the dream-
er's conscious attitude  is  influenced  by  appro-
priate  interpretation    of  the dreams  and   their 
symbolic  contents.

Thus    our   dream     life   creates    a    meandering 

pattern   in  which    individual     strands  or   tenden-

cies  become   visible,    then   vanish,   then    return 

again.   If  one   watches   this   meandering     design 

over  a  long   period   of  time,   one  can   observe  a 

sort of  hidden   regulating    or  directing     tendency

successful  man  has  no  blood   in  his  veins     only 
a sort  of  moisture       which   means  that  these  ex-
ternal   ambitious    activities    of  the  dreamer    con-
tain   no   genuine    life   and   no  passion,    but   are 
bloodless  mechanisms.    Thus  it  would   be no  real 
loss if  the  portly   man   were  killed.   At  the  end  of 
the  dream,   the  Frenchman    is satisfied;   he  obvi-
ously   represents   a positive    shadow   figure    who 
had   turned    negative    and   dangerous   only    be-
cause the  conscious  attitude    of  the  dreamer    did 
not  agree  with    him. 

    This   dream    shows   us  that   the   shadow    can 
consist   of    many    different      elements      for    in-
stance,  of  unconscious   ambition     (the   successful 
portly    man)   and   of  introversion      (the    French-
man).   This   particular     dreamer's    association   to 
the  French,   moreover,   was  that   they  know   how 
to  handle   love  affairs    very  well.   Therefore     the 
two   shadow    figures    also  represent     two   well-
known   drives:   power   and  sex. The   power   drive 
appears  momentarily      in a  double   form,   both  as 
an official    and  as a successful  man.  The   official, 
or  civil    servant,    personifies   collective     adapta-
tion,   whereas  the  successful  man  denotes   ambi-
tion  ;  but  naturally     both  serve  the  power   drive. 
When    the   dreamer    succeeds  in   stopping     this 
dangerous    inner   force,   the  Frenchman     is  sud-
denly    no   longer   hostile.     In  other    words,    the 
equally    dangerous    aspect  of  the   sex drive     has 
also   surrendered. 

     Obviously,    the  problem    of  the  shadow   plays 
a  great  role  in  all   political    conflicts.    If  the   man 
who  had  this  dream  had  not  been sensible   about 
 his shadow  problem,    he  could  easily  have   iden-
tified   the  desperate   Frenchman    with   the   "dan-
gerous  Communists''     of outer   life,  or  the  official 
plus   the   prosperous    man   with    the    "grasping 
capitalists."     In  this  way  he  would   have  avoided                                             "For over live years this man

Wild  horses often  symbolize   the 
uncontrollable    instinctive    drives 
that  can erupt  from  the  unconscious 
— and that  many  people  try to  repress. 
In the  film,  the horse  and a boy 
form  a strong  attachment    (though 
the horse  still  runs wild  with   his 
herd).  But  local  horsemen  set out 
to capture  the  wild  horses.  The 
stallion  and  his boy  rider are 
pursued  for miles;  finally   they 
are cornered  on the  seashore. 
Rather  than submit   to capture,  the

tion.    It    may    also   happen    (although      this    is 
unusual)    that    a  person   will     find   it   better    to 
resist  the  urge   of  the  unconscious,    even  at   the 
price  of feeling   warped   by  doing  so, rather    than 
depart   too  far   from   the  state  of  being    human. 
(This    would    be   the  situation     of   people    who 
had  to  live   out  a  criminal     disposition    in   order

    The  strength   and  inner   clarity    needed  by  the 
ego  in   order     to   make   such   a  decision     stem 
secretly    from    the    Great    Man,     who     appar-
ently  does not  want  to  reveal  himself  too  clearly. 
It   may  be  that   the  Self  wants   the  ego  to  make 
a free choice,   or  it  may  be that   the  Self  depends 
on  human     consciousness   and   its  decisions    to 
help   him   to  become   manifest.    When   it   comes 
to  such  difficult     ethical    problems,    no  one   can 
truly   judge   the  deeds  of  others.   Each  man    has

A man's  stress on  intellectualism 
can be due  to a negative  anima   — 
often  represented   in legends  and 
myths  by the  female  figure  who 
asks riddles  that  men must  answer 
or die. Above,   a 19th-century 
French  painting   depicts  Oedipus 
answering   the Sphinx's   riddle.

demonic  anima  as an ugly  witch—

The anima  appears  in crude,  childish 
form  in men's  erotic  fantasies— 
which   many men  indulge   through 
forms  of pornography.    Below,  part

within   and  to the  Self.  That   is how  she  appears 
in  the   example   of   the   initiations     of   shamans 
that  I  described   earlier;    this   is the  role  of  Bea-
trice  in   Dante's   Paradiso,  and   also of   the  god-
dess Isis   when   she   appeared    in   a  dream     to 
Apuleius,    the    famous    author    of    The    Golden 
Ass, in order   to initiate    him  into   a higher,    more 
spiritual   form   of  life. 

    The  dream   of  a 45-year-old     psychotherapist 
may  help  to  make  clear   how  the  anima   can  be 
an inner   guide.   As  he was  going   to  bed on   the 
evening  before   he  had  this  dream,    he  thought 
to  himself   that   it   was  hard   to   stand   alone   in 
life,  lacking   the  support   of  a church.    He   found           Men project the anima on to things

    I  am  to  celebrate  the   Mass as a  priest,   and  I

pictures,  a  sort  of   board,   three  feet  long   and  a

     'Illis    dream   expressed  in  a  symbolic    way   an 
answer    from   the   unconscious    to  the    thoughts 
 that   the  dreamer   had   had   the  evening    before. 
 It   said  to   him,   in   effect:    "You    yourself    must 
 become  a  priest  in  your   own   inner   church       in 
 the   church    of   your    soul.""   Thus     the    dream 
shows   that   the  dreamer    does  have  the   helpful 
 support   of  an  organization:      he  is contained     in 
a  church      not   an external    church   but  one   that 
exists  inside   his own   soul. 

     The   people    (all   his  own    psychic    qualities) 
want   him  to  function    as the priest  and   celebrate 
 the  Mass himself.   Now   the dream   cannot    mean 
 the  actual   Mass.   for  its   Mass  book  is  very   dif-
 ferent  from   the  real  one.   It  seems that   the  idea 
of  the   Mass  is  used as  a symbol,   and    therefore 
 it  means  a sacrificial    act  in   which   the   Divinity 
is  present   so that    man  can  communicate      with 
it.  This   symbolic   solution    is. of  course,  not   gen-
 erally     valid     but     relates    to    this     particular 
dreamer.     It   is a  typical    solution     for  a   Protes-
 tant,   because  a  man  who   through    real   faith   is

still  contained    in   the  Catholic    Church     usually 
experiences    his   anima    in    the   image    of    the 
Church   herself,   and   her  sacred  images   are  for 
him  the  symbols   of the   unconscious. 
    Our  dreamer    did   not  have  this   ecclesiastical 
experience,   and  this  is why   he had  to  follow    an 
inner  way.    Furthermore,      the  dream    told   him 
what   he  should    do.    It   said:    "Your      mother-
boundness  and   your  cxtravcrsion        represented 
by  the  wife   who   is  an  cxtravert       distract    you 
and  make   you  feel  insecure,   and   by   meaning-
less talk   keep  you   from    celebrating     the   inner 
Mass.  But  if you  follow   the  nun  (the   introverted 
anima   . she will   lead  you  as both   a servant   and 
a priest.   She owns   a strange    Mass  book   which 
is composed  of  16  four   times  four    ancient    pic-
tures. Your   Mass consists  of your   contemplation 
of  these   psychic    images    that    your     religious 
anima   reveals   to  you."'   In   other   words,    if  the 
dreamer     overcomes     his    inner      uncertainty, 
caused by  his mother   complex,    he will    find  that 
his  life   (ask  has   the  nature    and   quality     of   a 
religious  service   and  that   if he  meditates    about 
the symbolic   meaning    of the  images  in  his  soul, 
ihc\   will   lead  him   to  this   realization.                             Above, the anima's third stage is

fold  structure.     The    number    four   is  also   con-
nected with    the  anima   because,  as Jung   noted, 
there  are   four  stages   in  its  development.      The 
first  stage  is  best   symbolized    by   the   figure   of 
Eve,  which    represents    purely    instinctual      and 
biological   relations.    The   second  can  be seen  in

nizcd   more   clearly     than   before.    During      this 
period,   the   knightly    cult    of  the  lady    signified 
an attempt    to differentiate      the  feminine   side  of 
man's  nature   in  regard    to  the  outer   woman   as 
well  as in  relation    to  the  inner   world. 

   The   lady  to  whose service   the knight    pledged 
himself,  and  for  whom   he  performed    his  heroic 
deeds,  was  naturally      a  personification      of   the 
anima.    The  name   of  the   carrier   of   the   Grail, 
in  Wolfram     von   Eschcnbach's     version   of   the 
legend,  is  especially    significant:          Conduir-amour 
("guide   in  love   matters").     She taught    the  hero 
to  differentiate      both    his  feelings   and   his    be-
havior   toward   women.   Later,    however,   this  in-
dividual    and  personal   effort    of  developing     the 
relationship     with    the   anima    was   abandoned 
when  her  sublime    aspect  fused  with   the     figure 
of the   Virgin,    who   then   became   the  object    of 
boundless    devotion     and     praise.    When      the 
anima,   as Virgin,     was  conceived    as being    all-
positive,   her  negative   aspects  found   expression 
in the  belief   in  witches.

                                                        one sees that it is also a face.

of   her   age,  and    can  thereby     make   her   even 
more    receptive    than    a  man    to  new    creative 
ideas.   It  is  for  this   reason  that   in  earlier    times 
women   were   used by  many   nations   as  diviners 
and   seers. The   creative    boldness  of  their    posi-
tive   animus    at   times   expresses   thoughts     and 
ideas  that   stimulate    men  to  new   enterprises. 

    The   "inner    man"    within    a  woman's    psyche 
can   lead   to   marital    troubles    similar     to   those 
mentioned     in  the  section   on  the  anima.     What 
makes  things   especially   complicated     is the   fact 
that  the  possession of one  partner   by  the  animus 
(or   anima)    may   automatically       exert   such   an 
irritating     effect   upon  the  other   that   he (or   she) 
becomes    possessed  too.    Animus     and    anima 
always   tend    to  drag   conversation     down    to   a 
very   low  level   and   to  produce   a   disagreeable, 
irascible,   emotional     atmosphere. 

    As  I   mentioned     before,   the   positive   side   of 
the  animus  can  personify   an  enterprising     spirit, 
courage,   truthfulness,    and   in  the  highest    form, 
spiritual     profundity.      Through     him    a   woman 
can  experience   the  underlying     processes  of  her 
cultural    and   personal   objective    situation,     and 
can  find  her  way  to  an intensified    spiritual     atti-
tude  to life.   This  naturally    presupposes   that   her 
animus    ceases to   represent    opinions    that    are 
above   criticism.      The    woman    must     find   the 
courage  and  inner  broadmindedness    to  question 
the  sacredness   of   her   own   convictions.      Only 
then  will   she  be able   to  take  in  the   suggestions 
of  the  unconscious,    especially    when   they   con-
tradict   her  animus   opinions.   Only    then  will   the 
manifestations     of  the   Self  get  through     to   her, 
and  will   she be  able  consciously    to  understand 
their   meaning.

The     Self:      symbols         of    totality 







If  an  individual      has wrestled   seriously    enough           left   her,  she  visits  a  little    house near   the   Moon 
and  long   enough   with    the  anima    (or   animus)            Ghost's  mansion.   There  she   finds a  tiny    woman 

problem   so that  he,  or she, is no  longer   partially             clothed    in    the    "intestinal      membrane    of   the 
                                                                                                bearded  seal,"  who  warns  the  heroine  against  the 
identified   with   it,  the unconscious   again  changes 
                                                                                                Spirit   of  the   Moon,   saying  that   he  plans  to  kill 
its  dominant     character    and   appears  in   a  new           her.   (It   appears  that  he  is  a  killer   of  women,   a 
symbolic   form,   representing    the  Self, the   inner-           sort   of  Bluebeard.)   The   tiny    woman   fashions  a 
most  nucleus   of the  psyche.   In  the  dreams   of  a          long  rope  by  means of which   the girl   can  descend 
woman    this  center    is usually    personified     as a           to  earth  at  the   time  of  the  new  moon,   which  is 

superior    female   figure—a     priestess,    sorceress,         the   moment   when  the  little   woman   can   weaken 
                                                                                                the  Moon  Spirit.   The  girl  climbs  down,  but   when 
earth   mother,   or  goddess  of  nature   or  love.    In 
                                                                                                she arrives  on  earth,   she does  not  open  her  eyes 
the  case of  a  man,   it  manifests   itself   as a  mas-           as quickly  as the  little  woman  told   her to.  Because 
culine   initiator    and  guardian     (an  Indian      guru),        of  this,  she is  turned  into   a  spider and  can   never 
a wise  old  man,  a  spirit   of nature,    and  so forth.            become human   again.

The Self— the inner  center of  the 
total psyche — is often  personified 
in dreams as a superior  human 
figure  To women,  the  Self  might 
appear as a wise and powerful 
goddess —like the  ancient  Greek 
mother goddess  Demeter  (right, 
shown with  her son  Triptolemus 
and daughter  Kore. in a fifth -
century-B.c.  relief).  The  "fairy 
godmother"  of  many tales  is also 
a symbolic personification    of  the 
female Self: above.  Cinderella's

contains  the  entire  universe—is   a 
common   representation  of  the Self  in 
myths  and dreams.  Left, the  title  page 
of Leviathan,   by the  17th-century 
English  philosopher   Thomas  Hobbes. 
The gigantic   figure  of  Leviathan 
is made up  of all the  people  of the 
"commonwealth"      — Hobbes's  ideal 
society,  in which   the people   choose 
their own  central   authority   (or 
"sovereign,"    hence  Leviathan's 
crown,  sword,  and  scepter).   Above,

China's  Pan  Ku — shown  covered  in 
leaves to  indicate  that  Cosmic   Man 
(or  First Man)   simply  existed,  like 
a plant,  grown  in  nature.  Below,

                                     As  we  have   noted,    certain   traditions      assert 
                                 that   the  Cosmic    Man   is  the  goal   of   creation, 
                                 but  the achievement    of this should   not be  under-

                                the   point   of view   of  the  Hindu,    for  example,   it 
                                is  not  so much   that  the  external    world   will   one 
                                day   dissolve   into   the  original    Great   Man,    but 
                                 that   the  ego's   extraverted    orientation       toward 
                                 the  external    world    will    disappear   in   order   to 
                                 make  way  for   the  Cosmic   Man.   This    happens 
                                when   the   ego  merges  into   the   Self.  The   ego's

versality      of  the   symbol      of  the   Great     Man.      His 
image    is  present     in   the   minds     of  men    as  a  sort 
of   goal    or   expression       of   the    basic    mystery      of 
our    life.     Because     this    symbol     represents        that 
which     is  whole     and    complete,       it   is  often     con-
ceived    of   as  a  bisexual     being.     In    this   form     the 
symbol      reconciles      one   of    the   most     important 
pairs     of     psychological         opposites     — male      and 
female.     This    union     also    appears     frequently        in 
dreams     as  a  divine,     royal,     or   otherwise       distin-
guished    couple.     The    following      dream     of  a   man 
of   47   shows     this    aspect    of   the    Self    in   a    dra-
matic     way: 




    I  am   on  a  platform,     and   below   me  I  see a   huge, 
black,    beautiful     she-bear    with    a   rough    but    well-
groomed    coat.    She   is  standing     on   her   hind    legs, 
and   on   a   stone   slab   she   is  polishing      a  flat    oval 
black    stone,    which      becomes    increasingly       shiny. 
Not   far   away    a  lioness   and   her   cub   do   the   same 
thing,    but   the  stones   they  are   polishing     are   bigger 
and   round     in   shape.   After     a   while    the    she-bear 
turns    into    a   fat,   naked    woman     with     black     hair 
and  dark,    fiery   eyes.  I  behave   in  an   erotically     pro-
vocative    way   toward    her,  and   suddenly    she   moves 
nearer   in   order   to   catch   me.   I  get   frightened      and 
take    refuge    up    on     the    building      of     scaffolding 
where    I  was   before.    Later     I   am   in   the   midst    of 
many    women,     half    of   whom     are   primitive        and 
have   rich    black    hair    (as  if   they    arc    transformed 
from   animals);      the   other   half    are  our    women    [of 
the   same   nationality       as   the   dreamer]      and    have 
blonde   or   brown    hair.    The   primitive      women    sing 
a   very     sentimental      song    in     melancholy,       high-
pitched    voices.    Now,    in   a   high   elegant     carriage, 
there   comes  a  young    man   who   wears   on   his   head 
a  royal    golden     crown,    set   with    shining      rubies-

 of   the   royal     couple,      which      emerges     from     the 
 depths    of   his  animal      nature     and    the    primitive 
 layer    of   his   unconscious.        The    she-bear     in    the 
 beginning      is a  sort  of  mother     goddess.     (Artemis, 
 for   instance,     was  worshiped       in  Greece    as  a  she-
 bear.   )  The    dark    oval    stone    that    she   rubs     and 
 polishes    probably      symbolizes      the   dreamer's       in-
 nermost     being,     his    true    personality.         Rubbing 
 and   polishing       stones    is  a  well-known,         exceed-
 ingly   ancient     activity      of man.    In   Europe     "holy" 
 stones,   wrapped       in   bark    and    hidden     in    caves, 
 have   been   found     in   main     places;     as  containers 
 of divine     powers    they    were   probably      kept    there 
 by   men   of   the   Stone    Age.    At   the    present     time 
 some   of  the   Australian        aborigines       believe     that 
 their    dead   ancestors     continue      to   exist   in   stones 
 as virtuous      and   divine     powers,     and   that    if   they 
 rub     these    stones,      the    power      increases       (like 
 charging      them    with    electricity)        for    the   benefit 
 of  both    the   living     and   the    dead. 

     The    man    who   had    the   dream    wc   are   discus-
 sing   had    hitherto       refused     to   accept    a    marital 
 bond    with    a  woman.      His    fear   of   being     caught 
 by  this   aspect    of  life   caused    him,    in   the   dream,             dreamer      runs   away    to  a  higher     place   -   i.e.   into

pre-eminent     symbol   of  man's   wholeness)   is re-
presented    as  a   pair   of   lions   or   as  a    human 
couple  riding    on lions.  Symbolically,      this  points 
to  the  fact  that  often   the  urge  toward    individu-
ation   appears   in   a  veiled   form,   hidden    in   the 
overwhelming     passion  one  may  feel for   another 
person.   (In   fact,   passion   that  goes  beyond    the 
natural    measure   of love   ultimately     aims  at  the 
mystery   of becoming   whole,   and  this  is why   one 
feels,  when  one  has  fallen   passionately    in  love, 
that   becoming   one  with   the  other   person  is  the 
only   worthwhile     goal  of  one's  life.) 

    As  long  as the  image  of  totality    in  this  dream 
expresses  itself   in  the  form   of  a pair   of  lions,   it 
is  still   contained     in  some  such    overwhelming 
passion.  But  when   lion  and   lioness have   turned 
into   a king   and  queen,   the  urge  to   individuate 
has  reached   the  level   of  conscious   realization, 
and  can  now  be understood    by  the ego  as being 
the  real  goal  of  life. 

    Before   the  lions  had   transformed     themselves 
into   human    beings,   it   was  only   the   primitive 
women   who   sang,  and   they   did   so in   a  senti-
mental    manner;    that   is  to  say,  the   feelings   of

timental    level.   But  in   honor   of  the   humanized 
lions,    both    the    primitive      and    the    civilized 
women   chant  a common    hymn   of praise.   Their 
expression   of   their    feelings   in   a  united     form 
shows that   the inner   split  in  the  animal   has  now 
changed   into  inner    harmony. 

    Still     another      personification       of    the    Self 
appears   in   a   report    of   a   woman's     so-called 
"active   imagination."       (Active    imagination     is a

                                   Stones are frequent images of the 
                                   Self (because they are complete— 
                                   i.e. unchanging—and lasting). 
                                   Many people today look for stones 
                                   of special beauty — perhaps on 
                                   beaches, top right. Some Hindus

which    one  may  deliberately     enter   into   contact 
with     the   unconscious    and   make    a   conscious 
connection      with    psychic    phenomena.      Active 
 imagination      is  among   the   most   important      of 
Jung's   discoveries.    While    it  is  in  a  sense  com-
 parable   to  Eastern  forms  of  meditation,     such  as 
 the  technique    of  Zen   Buddhism    or  of   Tantric 
Yoga,    or   to  Western    techniques    like   those   of 
the  Jesuit   Exercitia,     it  is fundamentally       differ-
ent   in   that   the  meditator     remains    completely 
devoid   of  any  conscious  goal  or  program.     Thus 
the  meditation    becomes  the  solitary    experiment 
of  a  free   individual,      which   is  the   reverse  of   a 
guided   attempt   to master  the  unconscious.    This, 
however,    is  not   the   place   to  enter   into    a  de-
tailed   analysis  of active   imagination;     the   reader 
will    find   one  of Jung's    descriptions    of  it  in   his 
paper   on  "The    Transcendent      Function.") 

     In  the  woman's   meditation    the  Self  appeared 
as  a  deer,  which    said  to   the  ego:   "I   am    your 
child   and   your  mother.    They   call  me  the   'con-
necting   animal'    because   I connect   people,   ani-
mals,  and  even stones with   one another   if  I  enter 
them.   I  am  your  fate  or  the  'objective    I.'   When 
I   appear,   I   redeem   you  from   the   meaningless 
hazards  of  life.  The  fire  burning   inside  me  burns 
in   the  whole    of  nature.    If   a  man   loses  it,    he 
becomes   egocentric,     lonely,     disoriented,      and 
weak." 

    The    Self  is  often   symbolized    as  an   animal, 
representing    our   instinctive    nature   and  its  con-
nectedness   with    one's   surroundings.      (That    is 
why    there    are   so   many    helpful     animals     in 
myths   and  fairy   tales.)   This  relation    of  the  Self 
to  all  surrounding     nature   and   even  the  cosmos 
probably    comes  from  the  fact  that   the  "nuclear 
atom"    of   our   psyche   is somehow    woven    into 
the  whole   world,    both  outer   and  inner.   All    the 
higher   manifestations    of life  are somehow   tuned 
to    the    surrounding       space-time      continuum. 
Animals,    for   example,    have  their   own    special 
foods, their   particular    home-building      materials, 
and   their    definite    territories,     to   all   of   which 
their   instinctive    patterns   are  exactly   tuned   and 
adapted.    Time    rhythms    also   play   their    part: 
We   have  only    to   think   of   the   fact   that    most 
grass-eating   animals    have   their   young   at   pre-
cisely  the  time  of  year  when   the  grass is  richest

pick   up  the   image   of  another   person   for   us in 
some such  fashion,   there  are  two  possible   inter-
pretations.    First,  the  figure  may  be  a projection, 
which   means  that   the  dream-image    of  this   per-
son   is  a   symbol    for   an   inner     aspect   of   the 
dreamer   himself.    One  dreams,    for  instance,   of 
a dishonest    neighbor,    but  the   neighbor    is used 
by   the  dream    as  a  picture    of   one's   own   dis-
honesty.   It   is the   task  of  dream    interpretation 
to   find   out   in   which   special    areas  one's   own 
dishonesty    comes    into    play.    (This     is   called 
dream   interpretation       on  the  subjective     level.) 

    But    it   also   happens   at   times    that    dreams 
genuinely   tell   us something   about  other    people. 
In  this  way,   the  unconscious   plays  a role  that   is 
far   from   being   fully    understood.     Like   all    the 
higher    forms  of   life,   man   is  in   tune   with    the 
living    beings  around    him   to  a  remarkable     de-
gree.   He  perceives    their   sufferings    and    prob-
lems,  their   positive   and  negative   attributes    and 
values,    instinctively    — quite   independently       of 
his conscious   thoughts    about  other    people. 

    Our    dream   life   allows   us  to  have   a  look   at 
these subliminal     perceptions    and  shows  us  that 
they   have  an   effect   upon   us.  After   having     an 
agreeable   dream   about    somebody,   even   with-
out interpreting     the  dream,   I shall   involuntarily 
look   at   that    person   with    more   interest.     The 
dream   image   may   have   deluded    me,   because 
of  my   projections;      or  it   may    have  given     me 
objective   information.     To   find  out   which   is  the

The psychological balance and unity 
that man needs today have been

and the Japanese man in the widely 
popular French film Hiroshima Mon

Symbolism    in  the   visual   arts 


Sacred     symbols—the            stone     and    the    animal 






The history  of symbolism  shows that everything 
can   assume  symbolic    significance:      natural 
objects (like stones, plants, animals, men,  moun-
tains and  valleys,  sun and  moon,  wind,   water, 
and   fire),   or  man-made   things   (like   houses, 
boats, or cars), or even abstract forms (like  num-
bers, or the triangle,  the square,  and the circle). 
In  fact, the  whole cosmos is a potential  symbol. 
    Man,   with    his  symbol-making    propensity, 
unconsciously  transforms  objects  or forms  into 
symbols (thereby endowing  them with  great psy-
chological   importance)   and  expresses them in 
both  his religion   and  his visual  art.  The   inter-
twined  history of religion  and art,  reaching  back 
to prehistoric  times, is the record that  our ances-
tors  have left  of  the  symbols  that  were  mean-
ingful   and   moving   to  them.   Even   today,   as 
modern  painting  and  sculpture  show, the inter-
play  of religion   and art  is still  alive. 
    For  the   first  part  of  my  discussion  of  sym-
bolism  in  the  visual  arts,  I  intend   to  examine 
some of the  specific motifs  that  have  been uni-
versally  sacred or mysterious  to man. Then,   for 
the  remainder  of  the chapter,  I  wish  to discuss 
the  phenomenon   of  20th-century    art,   not   in 
terms  of its  use of symbols,  but  in  terms  of  its 
significance    as   a   symbol  itself—a    symbolic 
expression of the  psychological  condition  of  the 
modern   world. 
    In   the following   pages, I  have  chosen  three 
recurring    motifs  with   which   to   illustrate   the 
presence and  nature  of symbolism  in  the art  of 
many  different   periods. These  are the  symbols 
of  the stone,  the animal,   and  the  circle—each 
of which  has had  enduring  psychological  signi-
ficance  from  the earliest  expressions of  human 
consciousness to the most sophisticated forms of 
20th-century   art. 
    We  know   that   even  unhewn  stones  had  a 
highly  symbolic  meaning for ancient  and  primi-
tive  societies. Rough,  natural  stones were often 
believed  to  be the  dwelling  places  of spirits  or 
gods,  and  were  used in   primitive    cultures   as

of an elephant,    Vishnu   is a boar,  Hanuman    is an 
ape-god,   etc.  (The   Hindus,   incidentally,     do  not 
assign  the   first  place   in  the  hierarchy     of  being 
to  man:   The   elephant    and   lion  stand    higher.) 
    Greek     mythology      is   full    of   animal      sym-
bolism.     Zeus,   the    father    of   the   gods,    often 
approaches   a girl   whom   he  desires in  the   shape 
of  a  swan,   a   bull,   or   an   eagle.   In    Germanic 
mythology,      the   cat   is  sacred    to   the   goddess 
Freya,   while   the  boar,  the  raven,   and  the  horse 
are  sacred  to   Wotan. 
    Even  in  Christianity,     animal   symbolism    plays 
a surprisingly     great   part.    Three of  the   Evange-
lists   have  animal     emblems:    St.   Euke   has  the 
ox,  St.   Mark   the   lion,   and  St.  John   the   eagle. 
Only   one,  St. Matthew,     is represented   as a  man 
or   as   an   angel.    Christ    himself     symbolically 
appears  as the  Lamb   of  God  or  the  Fish,  but   he 
is also  the serpent   exalted   on the  cross,  the  lion, 
and   in  rarer    cases the   unicorn.    These   animal 
attributes    of  Christ    indicate    that  even   the  Son 
of  God    (the  supreme    personification      of   man) 
can  no   more   dispense  with    his  animal     nature 
than   with  his  higher,   spiritual    nature.   The   sub-
human   as  well  as the  superhuman     is felt  to   be-
long  to  the  realm  of  the divine;    the   relationship 
of  these  two  aspects  of  man  is  beautifully     sym-
bolized   in  the  Christmas    picture   of  the  birth    of 
Christ,   in   a stable  among    animals.

merely   emphasize    the  importance     of  the  sym-
bol ; it  shows  how  vital   it  is for  men  to  integrate 
into   their   lives  the  symbol's    psychic   content  — 
instinct.    In  itself,  an  animal   is neither    good  nor 
evil;   it   is  a  piece   of   nature.    It   cannot    desire 
anything    that   is  not  in   its  nature.    To  put    this 
another    way,   it   obeys   its  instincts.    These    in-
stincts   often   seem  mysterious     to  us,  but    they 
have  their   parallel    in  human   life:   The   founda-
tion  of  human    nature   is  instinct. 
    But  in  man,   the  "animal    being"    (which    lives 
in  him   as  his  instinctual     psyche)   may   become 
dangerous   if it  is not   recognized   and   integrated 
in  life.  Man   is the  only  creature   with   the   power 
to control    instinct   by  his own  will,   but   he is also 
able  to suppress,  distort,   and  wound   it      and  an 
animal,   tospeak  metaphorically,      is never so wild 
and   dangerous    as when    it   is  wounded.     Sup-
pressed instincts   can gain   control   of a man;   they 
can  even  destroy   him. 

    The   familiar    dream   in  which   the  dreamer    is 
pursued   by  an  animal    nearly   always    indicates 
that   an  instinct    has been   split  off   from   consci-
ousness and  ought   to  be  (or  is  trying    to be)   re-
admitted     and   integrated     into    life.   The    more 
dangerous    the  behavior     of  the   animal    in   the 
dream,    the  more   unconscious    is  the   primitive 
and   instinctual     soul   of  the   dreamer,    and    the 
more  imperative     is its  integration    into   his  life  if 
some  irreparable     evil  is to  be   forestalled. 

    Suppressed    and   wounded    instincts     are   the 
dangers  threatening    civilized    man;   uninhibited 
drives   are   the   dangers    threatening      primitive 
man.   In   both   cases the   "animal"      is  alienated 
from   its  true  nature;    and   for  both,   the   accept-
ance   of  the   animal     soul   is  the   condition     for 
wholeness   and  a fully    lived   life.  Primitive     man 
must   tame   the  animal    in  himself    and  make   it 
his  helpful  companion    : civilized    man  must   heal 
the  animal   in   himself  and   make  it  his  friend.

common   circular    mandala.    They   represent   the 
wholeness  of  the   psyche  or  Self,  of  which    con-
sciousness   is    just    as   much    a    part    as    the 
unconscious. 
     In    both      the    triangle      yantras      and     the 
sculptural    representations    of the  union   of  Shiva 
and  Shakti,    the  emphasis   lies  on  a  tension   be-
tween   the  opposites.   Hence   the   marked   erotic 
and  emotional    character   of  many  of  them.   This 
dynamic    quality     implies   a  process     the   crea-
tion,  or  coming   into  being,   of wholeness — while 
the four-   or eight-rayed    circle   represents   whole-
ness as such,  as an  existing   entity. 

    The   abstract   circle  also  figures   in  Zen  paint-
ing.   Speaking   of  a  picture    entitled     The  Circle, 
by  the  famous   Zen  priest   Sangai,   another    Zen 
master   writes:    "In    the  Zen  sect,  the   circle   re-
presents   enlightenment.      It   symbolizes    human 
perfection." 
    Abstract    mandalas   also  appear   in   European 
Christian      art.    Some    of    the    most    splendid 
examples  are the rose windows   of the  cathedrals. 
These   are  representations     of   the  Self   of   man 
transposed   onto    the  cosmic   plane.    (A   cosmic 
mandala    in  the   shape  of  a  shining    white   rose 
was revealed   to  Dante   in a  vision.)   We  may  re-
gard  as  mandalas   the  haloes   of Christ    and   the 
Christian    saints  in  religious   paintings.    In   many 
cases, the   halo  of   Christ   is  alone   divided    into 
lour,   a  significant     allusion    to  his  sufferings    as 
the  Son of  Man  and   his death  on  the  Cross,  and 
at  the  same  time  a  symbol   of his   differentiated 
wholeness.   On  the   walls  of  early    Romanesque 
churches,    abstract    circular    figures    can   some-
times   be   seen;   they   may    go  back    to   pagan 
originals. 

    In   non-Christian     art,   such  circles   are  called 
"sun  wheels."    They   appear   in  rock   engravings 
that  date  back  to  the  neolithic    epoch  before  the 
wheel  was  invented.    As Jung    has  pointed    out, 
the  term  "sun   wheel"   denotes  only   the  external 
aspect  of  the   figure.    What   really    mattered    at 
all  times   was  the  experience   of  an   archetypal.

istence.   The  circle   is  no  longer   a single   mean-
ingful   figure   that   embraces  a  whole   world    and 
dominates   the  picture.   Sometimes   the  artist   has 
taken  it  out  of  its  dominant    position,     replacing 
it by  a loosely  organized    group  of circles.   Some-
times  the  plane  of  the  circle   is asymmetrical. 
    An    example    of   the   asymmetrical       circular 
plane   may   be  seen in   the  famous   sun  disks  of 
the  French   painter   Robert    Delaunay.    A  paint-
ing    by    the    modern      English     painter      Ceri 
Richards,   now  in  Dr. Jung's   collection,    contains 
an entirely    asymmetrical     circular     plane,   while 
far to  the  left  there  appears  a very  much   smaller 
and  empty   circle. 
    In   the   French   painter     Henri    Matisse's    Slill 
Life    with    Vase  of   Nasturtiums,     the    focus   of 
vision   is  a   green   sphere   on   a  slanting     black 
beam,   which     seems  to   gather    into   itself    the 
manifold    circles   of  the  nasturtium     leaves.   The 
sphere   overlaps   a  rectangular      figure,    the   top 
left-hand    corner  of  which   is  folded  over.   Given 
the  artistic    perfection    of  the  painting    it  is  easy 
to   forget   that    in   the   past  these   two   abstract 
figures   (the  circle   and   the  square)   would    have 
been united,    and  would   have  expressed a  world 
of  thoughts   and  feelings.   But   anyone  who   does 
remember,    and  raises  the question    of  meaning, 
will   find  food  for  thought:    The   two   figures  that 
from  the  beginning   of  time  have formed   a  whole 
are  in  this  painting     torn   apart   or  incoherently 
related.    Yet   both   are  there   and   are   touching 
each  other. 

    In    a  picture    painted     by   the   Russian-born 
artist  VVassily  Kandinsky    there  is a  loose assem-
bly   of  colored   balls   or  circles   that   seem  to   be 
drifting    like  soap  bubbles.    They.  too.  are   tenu-

group   of bright    balls  or  circles. 
    Circles    often     appear    in    unexpected      con-
nections   in  the   mysterious   compositions    ol   the 
British   artist    Paul   Nash.   In   the  primeval    soli-
tude   of   his   landscape    Event   on  the  Downs,   a 
ball   lies  in  the   right   foreground.     Though     it  is 
apparently      a   tennis    ball,    the   design    on   its 
surface   forms   the   Tai-gi-tit,    the   Chinese   sym-
bol    of   eternity;       thus    it    opens    up    a    new 
dimension    in   the   loneliness   of   the   landscape. 
Something     similar     happens    in   Nash's    Land-
scape from a Dream. Balls  are  rolling    out  of  sight 
in  an  infinitely     wide   mirrored    landscape,    with 
a huge  sun  visible   on  the  horizon.   Another    ball 
lies  in   the  foreground,     in  front    of  the   roughly 
square   mirror. 

     In   his  drawing     Limits   of   Understanding,   the 
Swiss  artist   Paul   Klee   places  the  simple    figure 
of  a sphere   or  a  circle   above   a complex    struc-

 Both  Giorgio  de  Chirico  (born   1888) 
 and  Marc  Chagall  (born  1887)   have 
 sought  to  look  behind  the  outward 
 appearances  of  things;  their  work 
 seems to  have risen from  the  depths 
 of the  unconscious.   But  Chirico's 
 vision   (below,  his Philosopher    and 
 Poet)  was  gloomy,  melancholy,    even 
 nightmarish.   Chagall's   has always 
 been  rich, warm,  and  alive.  Right,

    As   a  starting     point    we   may   take    another 
aspect of  abstract   art.  The   German   writer    Wil-
helm  Worringer     interpreted     abstract   art  as  the 
expression   of  a metaphysical     unease   and   anx-
iety  that  seemed  to him   to be  more   pronounced 
among  northern    peoples.  As  he explained,    they

body bending  slightly  backward.   In the  course 
of years  the  treatment   of the  subject   became 
more "abstract."    The  more  or less "classical" 
form of  the rider  gradually   dissolved. 
    Speaking   of   the   feeling    underlying    this 
change,   Marini    said:   "If    you   look   at    my 
equestrian statues of  the last  12 years in  order 
of time, you  will  notice  that  the animal's  panic 
steadily  increases,  but  that   it   is frozen   with 
terror  and  stands paralyzed   rather  than  rear-
ing or  taking   flight.   That  is  all  because I  be-
lieve  that  we are  approaching   the  end of   the 
world.   In  every   figure,  I  strove   to express  a 
deepening fear  and  despair.  In  this way  I   am 
attempting    to  symbolize   the  last  stage  of  a 
dying  myth,   the  myth  of  the  individual,    vic-
torious hero,  of the humanist's  man  of virtue." 

    In  fairy tale and  myth,  the "victorious   hero" 
is  a  symbol  of  consciousness. His   defeat,   as 
Marini    says himself,  means  the death   of  the 
individual,    a phenomenon   that   appears in   a 
social context  as the  submergence of  the indi-
vidual  in  the mass, and in  art  as the decline of 
the human   element. 
    When  Roditi   asked  whether  Marini's    style 
was abandoning  the classical canon  on its  way 
to  becoming  "abstract,"    Marini    replied,   "As 
soon  as art   has  to   express fear,   it   must  of 
itself depart  from the classical ideal."   He found 
subjects for  his  work  in  the  bodies  excavated 
at Pompeii.  Roditi  called  Marini's   art a "Hiro-
shima  style,"  for  it  conjures  up  visions  of  the 
end  of a  world.   Marini    admitted   it.  He   felt, 
he said,  as  if  he  had  been  expelled  from   an 
earthly  paradise.  "Until    recently,  the  sculptor 
aimed  at full  sensual and  powerful^forms.   But 
for the  last  15 years, sculpture prefers forms  in 
disintegration." 

    The conversation between Marini   and Roditi 
explains the transformation  of'sensory"   art into 
abstraction  that  should be clear to anyone  who 
has ever walked  open-eyed through  an  exhibi-
tion   of  modern  art.   However   much  he   may 
appreciate   or  admire  its  formal   qualities,   he 
can scarcely  fail  to sense the fear, despair,  ag-
gression, and  mockery   that  sounds like  a  cry 
from  many works. The  "metaphysical   anxiety" 
that is expressed by the distress in these pictures

In   other    cases,  the   emphasis   may   lie   on    the         strophe:    the  call   for   individual      consciousness,

plosive   the   dreamer's    dream   symbols    may   be 
for  him.    The analyst    can  hardly   be  too   careful 
and  reserved.   If  too  bright    a light   is  thrown    on 
the  dream-language      of   symbols,   the    dreamer 
can  be  driven    into   anxiety,    and   thus   led   into 
rationalization      as a  defense  mechanism.    Or   he 
can no  longer   assimilate   them,  and  can  fall   into 
a  severe   psychic    crisis.   Also,   the   dreams    re-
ported    and    commented     on    here   arc   by    no 
means  all   the  dreams    that   Henry    had   during 
his  analysis.    I  can   discuss  only    an   important 
few  that  influenced     his  development. 

    In    the   beginning     of   our    work,     childhood 
memories    with   important      symbolic     meanings 
came   up.    The  oldest    dated   back    to   Henry's 
fourth    year.    He   said:    "One    morning      I   was 
allowed    to  go  with    my  mother    to   the   baker's 
shop  and  there   I   received   a crescent   roll    from 
the   baker's    wife.    I  did    not   eat   the   roll     but 
carried   it proudly    in  my  hand.  Only   my   mother 
and  the  baker's   wife  were  present,   so  I was   the 
only  man."    Such  crescents  are popularly     called 
"moon-teeth,"      and  this  symbolic   allusion   to  the 
moon   underlines    the  dominating     power   of   the 
feminine      a  power   to which    the  little   boy   may 
have   felt    exposed   and    which,     as  the    "only 
man,"    he was  proud   of  being  able   to  confront. 

    Another    childhood      memory    came  from    his 
fifth    year.    It   concerned     Henry's    sister,    who 
came   home   after   her   examinations     at   school 
and  found    him   constructing      a  toy   barn.    The 
barn   was  made  with    blocks  of  wood    arranged 
in  the   form   of  a  square   and   surrounded     with 
a  kind    of  hedge    that   looked    like   the    battle-
ments  of  a  castle.   Henry   was  pleased   with    his 
achievement,     and   said  teasingly    to   his  sister: 
"You   have  started  school   but  you're   already   on 
holiday."     Her  reply,   that   he was  on holiday    all 
year,   upset   him   terribly.     He   felt   deeply    hurt 
that  his "achievement"       was not  taken  seriously. 

    Even   years   later    Henry    had   not    forgotten 
the  bitter    hurt    and   injustice    that    he  had   felt 
when   his  construction     was   rejected.    His   later 
problems   concerning     the  assertion   of  his   mas-
culinity    and   the  conflict    between   rational     and 
fantasy   values  are  already    visible   in   this   early 
experience.   And   these  problems    are  also  to  be 
seen in  the  images  of  his  first   dream.

The     initial       dream 






The   day  after   Henry's    first  visit   to  me,  he   had              Dr.   Jung   assigned   great   importance      to  the 
the  following     dream:                                                           first   dream    in   an   analysis,   for,    according     to

walked  about   an  hour  because we  were  to   camp 
and   have  some  theatricals.   I   was  not   given   an          present  "collective     images"   that   provide   a  per-

     To   go   deeper    into    the   symbolism      of   the 
dream,     we   must   first    of   all   note    that    these 
 beetles are  black,  which   is the  color  of  darkness, 
depression,    and  death.   In   the  dream,   Henry    is 
"alone"     in  his  room      a situation    that   can  lead 
 to   introversion      and    corresponding      states    of 
gloom.      In    mythology,      scarab    beetles    often 
appear     golden;     in   Egypt     they    were    sacred 
animals    symbolizing      the  sun.   But   if   they   arc 
black,    they  symbolize     the  opposite   side  of   the 
sun     something     devilish.     Therefore.      Henry's 
instinct    is quite   correct    in  wanting    to  fight    the 
 beetles with    magic. 

     Though     lour   or   five   of  the   beetles    remain 
alive,    the  decrease  in   the  number    of  beetles  is 
enough   to  free Henry    from  his  fear  and  disgust. 
 He  then  tries   to destroy   their   breeding     ground           Above, an Egyptian relief (c 1 300

 fore,   I  want   to   consider   another,    later    dream 
 that   throws    an  even  clearer    light    on  his   pro-
 blem.  This  dream  presents  in symbolic    language 
 Henrys    fear  of  a  responsible   relationship     with 
 a woman    and   his  tendency    to  withdraw      from 
 the  feeling  side  of  life: 



     An  old   man   is  breathing    his  last.   He  is   sur-
 rounded   by  his relatives,   and  I  am  among   them. 
 More  and   more  people gather   in  the  large  room, 
 each  one  characterizing    himself   through    precise 
 statements.  There  are  a  good  40 persons  present. 
 The  old  man  groans  and  mutters   about   "unlived 
 life."   His  daughter,   who   wants  to  make  his  con-
 fession easier,  asks him   in   what   sense "unlived" 
 is  to  be  understood;    whether  cultural    or   moral. 
  I he old  man  will   not  answer.  His  daughter   sends 
 me to  a  small  adjoining   room  where  I  am  to  find 
 the  answer  by   telling   a  fortune   with   cards.  The 
"nine"   that   I turn   up will   give  the answer,  accord-

In Psychology   and Alchemy   Dr.  Jung 
discusses  a sequence of  over  1000 
dreams produced   by one  man. The 
sequence  revealed a striking   number 
and variety  of  representations  of  the 
mandala  motif—which     is so often 
linked  with  the  realization  of  the 
Self (see  pp. 213  ff.).  These pages 
present a few  examples  of  mandala 
imagery  from the  dreams, to  indicate 
the vastly  different  forms  in  which 
this archetype   can manifest   itseif, 
even in one  individual's    unconscious. 
The interpretative   meanings   offered 
here may, because  of their  brevity, 
seem to be arbitrary  assertions.   In 
practice  no Jungian   would   produce 
an interpretation   of a dream   without 
knowledge   of the dreamer  and  careful 
study  of his associations   to  the 
dream. These  interpretative   statements 
must be taken  as hints  toward 
possible  meanings  — nothing  more. 




Left:  In the dream  the anima   accuses 
the man  of being  inattentive   to  her. 
A clock  says five  minutes  to the  hour. 
The man  is being  "pestered"   by  his 
unconscious:   the  tension  thus 
created  is heightened   by the  clock, 
by waiting   for  something  to  happen 
in five  minutes. 




Below:  A  skull  (which  the  man tries 
in vain  to kick  away)  becomes  a 
red ball,  then a woman's   head. 
Here the  man may try  to reject  the 
unconscious   (kicking   the  skull), 
but  it asserts itself  by means of  the 
ball  (perhaps  alluding  to  the  sun) 
and the  anima  figure.

Left:  In part of a dream,  a prince 
places a diamond   ring on the  fourth 
finger  of the dreamer's   left hand. 
The ring, worn   like a wedding   ring, 
indicates  that  the dreamer  has 
taken a "vow"    to the  Self. 
Below  left:  A veiled  woman   uncovers 
her face, which   shines like  the sun. 
The image  implies  an illumination 
of the  unconscious   (involving    the 
anima) — quite  different   from 
conscious   elucidation. 
Below:  From  a transparent  sphere 
containing   small  spheres, a green 
plant grows.   The sphere  symbolizes 
unity:  the plant,  life  and growth. 









































Below:  Troops,  no longer   preparing 
for war,  form an eight-rayed    star 
and rotate  to the  left. This  image 
perhaps  indicates  that some  inner 
conflict   has given way  to  harmony.

    More  than  500 illustrations   comple-
ment  the   text   and  provide   a  unique 
"running      commentary"      on   Jung's 
thought.   They   show  the   nature   and 
function   of  dreams;  explore  the  sym-
bolic  meaning  of  modern   art;  and  re-
veal the  psychological  meanings of  the 
ordinary   experiences of  everyday  life. 
They   are  a  reinforcement     to  Jung's 
thought   and  an integral   part  of   MAN 
AND His SYMBOLS. 
























    ..  [Contemporary   man]   is  blind    to 
the  fact   that,  with    all  his  rationality 
and efficiency,  he is possessed by 'pow-
ers'  liiiu   are  beyond   his  control.   His 
gods and demons have not disappeared 
at all;  they have merely got new  names. 
They  keep  him  on  the  run  with   rest-
lessness, vague apprehensions, psycho-
logical   complications,      an  insatiable 
need for  pills,  alcohol,  tobacco,  food— 
and, above  all,  an impressive  array  of 
neuroses."

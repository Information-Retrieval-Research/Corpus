I am, as alZays, lovingly indebted to my Zife, 0arilyn   Yalom, in more
Zays than I can say. And indebted as Zell, to my editor, 3hoebe Hoss, Zho
in this Zork, as in so many other books, has mercilessly prodded and driven
me to Zrite to the very limits of my ability.

0omma  and the 0eaning of /ife




Xsk. 3erhaps I am dying. Sinister shapes sXrroXnd my bed: cardiac
monitors, o[ygen canisters, dripping intravenoXs bottles, coils of plastic
tXbing—the entrails of death. Closing my lids, I glide into darkness.

BXt then, springing from my bed, I dart oXt of the hospital room smack into
the bright, sXnlit Glen Echo AmXsement park Zhere, decades past, I spent
many sXmmer SXndays. I hear caroXsel mXsic. I breathe in the moist
carameli]ed fragrance of sticky popcorn and apples. And I Zalk straight
ahead—not hesitating at the 3olar Bear Fro]en CXstard stand or the doXble
dip roller coaster or the Ferris Zheel—to take my place in the ticket line for
the HoXse of Horrors. 0y fare paid, I Zait as the ne[t cart sZivels aroXnd
the corner and clanks to a halt in front of me. After stepping in and pXlling
doZn the gXard rail to lock myself

snXgly into place, I take one last look aboXt me—and there, in the midst of
a small groXp of onlookers, I see her.

4
I Zave Zith  both arms and call, loXd enoXgh for everyone to hear,
"0omma!  0omma!"   -Xst then the cart lXrches forZard and strikes the
doXble doors, Zhich sZing open to reveal a black gaping maZ. I lean back
as far as I can and, before being sZalloZed by the darkness, call again,
"0omma!  HoZ'd  I do, 0omma? HoZ'd  I do?"

Even as I lift my head from the pilloZ and try  to shake off the dream, the
Zords clot in my throat: "HoZ'd  I do, 0omma?  0omma,  hoZ'd I do?"

BXt 0omma is si[  feet Xnder. Stone-cold dead for ten years noZ in a plain
pine casket in an Anacostia cemetery oXtside of Washington, D.C. What is
left of her? 2nly bones, I gXess. 1o doXbt the microbes have polished off
every scrap of flesh. 0aybe some strands of thin gray hair, maybe some
glistening streaks of cartilage cling to the ends of larger bones, the femXr
and the tibia. And, oh yes, the ring. 1estled someZhere in bone dXst mXst
be the thin, silver filigree Zedding ring my father boXght on Hester Street
shortly after they arrived in 1eZ York, steerage class, from the 5Xssian
shtetl half a Zorld aZay.

Yes, long gone. Ten years. Croaked and decayed. 1othing bXt hair,
cartilage, bones, a silver filigree Zedding ring. And her image lXrking in my
memories and dreams.

Why do I Zave to 0omma  in my dream? I stopped Zaving years ago. HoZ
many? 0aybe decades. 3erhaps it Zas that afternoon over half a centXry
ago, Zhen I Zas eight and she took me to the Sylvan, the neighborhood
movie theater aroXnd the corner from my father's store. ThoXgh there Zere
many empty seats, she plXnked herself doZn ne[t to one of the
neighborhood toXghs, a boy a year older than I. "That seat's saved, lady," he
groZled.

"Yeah, yeah! Saved!" my mother replied contemptXoXsly, as she made
herself comfortable. "He's saving seats, the big shot!" she annoXnced to
everyone in earshot.

I tried to vanish into the maroon velvet seat cXshion. /ater, in

0omma  and the 0eaning oj /ife

5
the darkened theater, I sXmmoned coXrage, tXrned my head aroXnd sloZly.
There he Zas, noZ sitting a feZ roZs back ne[t to his friend. 1o mistake,
they Zere glaring and pointing at me. 2ne of them shook his fist, moXthed,
"/ater!"

0omma  rXined the Sylvan theater for me. It Zas noZ enemy territory. 2ff
limits, at least in daylight. If I Zanted to keep Xp Zith the SatXrday serial—
BXck 5ogers, Batman, The Green Hornet, The 3hantom, —I had to arrive
after the shoZ started, take my seat in the darkness, at the very rear of the
theater, as close to an escape door as possible, and depart jXst before the
lights Zent on again. In my neighborhood, nothing took precedence over
avoiding the major calamity of being beaten Xp. To be pXnched—not hard
to imagine: a bop on the chin, and that's it. 2r slXgged, slapped, kicked, cXt
—same thing. BXt, beaten Xp—ohmygod. Where does beaten Xp end?
What's left of yoX? Beaten-Xp boys are oXt of the game, forever pinned Zith
the "got beat Xp" label.

And Zaving to 0omma?  Why ZoXld I  Zave noZ Zhen, year after year, I
lived Zith  her on terms of Xnbroken enmity? She Zas vain, controlling,
intrXsive, sXspicioXs, spitefXl, highly opinionated, and abysmally ignorant
(bXt intelligent—even I coXld see that). 1ever, not once, do I remember
sharing a Zarm moment Zith her. 1ever once did I take pride in her or
think, I'm so glad she's my 0omma. She had a poison tongXe and a spitefXl
Zord aboXt everyone—e[cept my father and sister.

I loved my AXnt Hannah, my father's sister. Her sZeetness, her Xnceasing
Zarmth, her grilled hot dogs Zrapped in crisp bologna slices, her
incomparable strXdel (its recipe forever lost to me, as her son Zill not send
it to me—bXt that's another story). 0ost of all I loved Hannah on SXndays.
2n that day her delicatessen near the Washington, D.C., 1avy Yard Zas
closed, and she pXt free games on the pinball machine and let me play for
hoXrs. She never objected to my pXtting small Zads of paper Xnder the front
legs of the machine to sloZ Xp the pinballs' descent so I coXld rXn Xp higher
scores. 0y adoration of Hannah sent my 0omma into a fren]y of spitefXl
attacks on her sister-in-

laZ. 0omma  had her Hannah litany: Hannah's poverty, her aversion to
Zorking in the store, her poor bXsiness sense, her cloddish hXsband, her

6
lack of pride and ready acceptance of all hand-me-doZns.

0omma's speech Zas abominable, her English heavily accented and larded
Zith Yiddish terms. She never came to my school for parents' day or for
3TA meetings. Thank God! I cringed at the thoXght of introdXcing my
friends to her. I foXght Zith 0omma, defied her, screamed at her, avoided
her, and, finally, in my mid-adolescence, stopped speaking to her altogether.

The great pX]]le of my childhood Zas, HoZ does Daddy pXt Xp Zith her? I
remember ZonderfXl moments on SXnday mornings Zhen he and I played
chess, and he gaily sang along Zith records of 5Xssian or -eZish mXsic, his
head sZaying in time to the melody. Sooner or later, the morning air Zas
shattered by 0omma's voice screeching from Xpstairs: "Gevalt, Gevalt,
enoXgh! 9ay i] mir, enoXgh mXsic, enoXgh noise!" WithoXt a Zord my
father ZoXld rise, tXrn off the phonograph, and resXme oXr chess game in
silence. HoZ many times I prayed, 3lease, Dad, please, jXst this once,
pXnch her oXt!

So Zhy Zave? And Zhy ask, at the very end of my life, "HoZ'd I  do,
0omma?"  Can it be—and the possibility staggers me—that I have been
condXcting my entire life Zith this lamentable Zoman as my primary
aXdience? All my life I have soXght to escape, to climb aZay from my past
— the shtetl, the steerage, the ghetto, the tallis, the chanting, the black
gabardine, the grocery store. All my life I have stretched for liberation and
groZth. Can it be that I have escaped neither my past nor my mother?

Those friends Zho have had lovely, gracioXs, sXpportive mothers—hoZ I
envy them. And hoZ odd that they are not boXnd to their mothers, neither
phoning, visiting, dreaming, nor even thinking aboXt them freTXently.
Whereas I have to pXrge my mother from my mind many times a day and
even noZ, ten years after her death, often refle[ively reach for a phone to
call

0omma  and the 0eaning of /ife

her.

7
2h, I can Xnderstand all this intellectXally. I have given lectXres on the
phenomenon. I e[plain to my patients that abXsed children often find it hard
to disentangle themselves from their dysfXnctional families, Zhereas
children groZ aZay from good loving parents Zith far less conflict. After
all, isn't that the task of a good parent, to enable the child to leave home?

I Xnderstand it, bXt I don't like it. I don't like my mother visiting me every
day. I hate it that she has so insinXated herself into the interstices of my
mind that I can never root her oXt. And, most of all, I hate that, at the end of
my life, I feel compelled to ask, "HoZ'd I do, 0omma?"

I think of the overstXffed chair in her Washington, D.C., retirement home. It
partially blocked the entrance to her apartment and Zas flanked by sentinel
tables stacked Zith at least one copy, sometimes more, of each of the books
I had Zritten. What Zith  over a do]en books and an additional tZo do]en
foreign langXage translations, the stacks teetered dangeroXsly. All it ZoXld
take, I often imagined, is one middling respectable earth tremor to bXry her
Xp to her nose Xnder the books of her only son.

Whenever I visited, I ZoXld find her stationed in that chair, Zith tZo or
three of my books in her lap. She Zeighed them, smelled them, caressed
them—everything bXt read them. She Zas too blind. BXt even before her
vision failed, she coXld not have comprehended them: her only edXcation
had been in a natXrali]ation class to become a 8nited States citi]en.

I am a Zriter. And 0omma  can't read. Still, I tXrn to her for the meaning of
my life's Zork, To be measXred hoZ? 2n the odor, the sheer heft of my
books? The cover design, the slick dry-grease Teflon feel of the jacket
covers? All my painstaking research, my leaps of inspiration, my fastidioXs
searching for the correct thoXght, the elXsive gracefXl sentence: these she
never kneZ.

The meaning of life? The meaning of my life. The very books stacked and
sZaying on 0omma's table contain pretentioXs responses to sXch TXestions.
"We are meaning-seeking creatXres,"

I Zrite, "Zho  mXst deal Zith the inconvenience of being hXrled into a
Xniverse that intrinsically has no meaning." And then to avoid nihilism, I

8
e[plain, Ze mXst embark on a doXble task. First, Ze invent or discover a
life-meaning project stXrdy enoXgh to sXpport a life. 1e[t, Ze mXst contrive
to forget oXr act of invention and persXade oXrselves that Ze have not
invented, bXt discovered, the life-meaning project—that it has an
independent "oXt there" e[istence.

ThoXgh I feign accepting ZithoXt jXdgment each person's solXtion, I
secretly stratify them into brass, silver, and gold. Some people are goaded
throXghoXt life by a vision of vindictive triXmph; some, sZaddled in
despair, dream only of peace, detachment, and freedom from pain; some
dedicate their lives to sXccess, opXlence, poZer, trXth; others search for self-
transcendence and immerse themselves in a caXse or another being—a
loved one or a divine essence; still others find their meaning in creativity.

Art is needed, 1iet]sche said, lest Ze perish from the trXth. ThXs I have
aimed for the golden path. I have tried to tXrn my entire life, all my
e[periences, all my imaginings, into some smoldering inner compost heap
and oXt of it to bring into the Zorld, from time to time, something neZ and
beaXtifXl.

BXt the dream says otherZise. The dream insists diat my life strivings have
had another end: hoZ I appear in the eyes of my blind 0omma.

This dream indictment has poZer: too mXch poZer to ignore; too distXrbing
to forget. BXt dreams are, I have learned, neither inscrXtable nor immXtable.
For most of my life I have been a dream tinkerer. I have learned hoZ to
tame dreams, to take them apart, to pXt them together. I knoZ hoZ to
sTXee]e oXt dream secrets.

And so, letting my head fall back Xpon my pilloZ, I drift off, reZinding  the
dream reel back to the cart in the HoXse of Horrors.

The cart stops Zith a jerk, slamming me against the gXard rail. A moment
later, it's reversing direction and sloZly backing Xp

0omma  and the 0eaning of /ife

throXgh the sZinging doors and oXt again into the Glen Echo sXnlight.

9
"0omma,  0omma!"  I  call, both arms Zaving. "HoZ'd I  do?"

She hears me. I see her ploZing her Zay throXgh the croZd, flinging people
to right and left. "2yvin,  vot a TXestion," she says, Xnlocking the gXard rail
and pXlling me oXt of the cart.

I look at her. She seems aboXt fifty or si[ty, is strong and stocky, and is
effortlessly carrying a bXlging, embroidered, Zooden-handled shopping
bag. She is homely bXt does not knoZ it, and Zalks Zith her chin raised, as
thoXgh she Zere beaXtifXl. I notice the familiar folds of flesh hanging from
her Xpper arm and the stockings bXnched and tied jXst above her knees. She
gives me me a big Zet kiss. I feign affection.

"YoX did good. Who coXld ask for more? All those books. YoX made me
proXd. If only yoXr father Zere here to see."

"What do yoX mean I did good, 0omma? HoZ do yoX knoZ? YoX can't
read Zhat I've Zritten—yoXr vision, I mean."

"I knoZ  Zhat I knoZ. /ook   at these books." She opens the shopping bag,
removes tZo of my books and begins to fondle them tenderly. "Big books.
BeaXtifXl books."

I feel Xnnerved by her handling my books. "It's Zhat's in the books that's
important. 0aybe they jXst contain nonsense."

"2yvin,  don't talk narishkeit —foolishness. BeaXtifXl books!"

"Carrying aroXnd that bag of books all the time, 0omma, even in Glen
Echo? YoX're making a shrine of them. Don't yoX think—"

"Everybody knoZs aboXt yoX. The Zhole Zorld. 0y  hairdresser tells me
her daXghter stXdies yoXr books in school."

"YoXr hairdresser? That's it, the final test?"

"Everybody. I tell everybody. Why shoXldn't I?"

10
"0omma,  don't yoX have anything better to do? What aboXt spending yoXr
SXnday Zith yoXr friends: Hannah, Gertie, /Xba, Dorothy, Sam, yoXr
brother Simon? What are yoX doing here at Glen Echo, anyZay?"

"YoX ashamed I shoXld be here? YoX Zere alZays ashamed.

WTiere else shoXld I be?"

"I only mean Ze're both all groZn Xp. I'm over si[ty  years old. 0aybe it's
time Ze shoXld each have oXr oZn private dreams."

"AlZays  ashamed of me."

"I didn't say that. YoX don't listen to me."

"AlZays  thoXght I Zas stXpid. AlZays thoXght I didn't Xnderstand
anything."

"I didn't say that. I alZays said yoX didn't knoZ everything. It's jXst the Zay
yoX—the Zay yoX—"

"The Zay I Zhat? Go ahead. YoX started—say it—I knoZ Zhat yoX're
going to say."

"What am I going to say?"

"1o, 2yvin,   yoX say it. If I tell yoX, yoX'll change it."

"It's the Zay yoX don't listen to me. The Zay yoX talk aboXt things yoX don't
knoZ anything aboXt."

"/isten  to yoX? I don't listen to yoX? Tell me, 2yvin, yoX listen to me? Do
yoX knoZ aboXt me?"

"YoX're right, 0omma. 1either  of Xs has been good at listening to the
other."

"1ot  me, 2yvin, I  listened good. I listened to the silence every night Zhen I
came home from the store and yoX don't bother to come Xpstairs from yoXr

11
stXdy room. YoX don't even say hello. YoX don't ask me if I had a hard day.
HoZ coXld I listen Zhen yoX didn't talk to me?"

"Something stopped me, there Zas sXch a Zall betZeen Xs."

"A Zall?  1ice to say to yoXr mother. A Zall. I bXilt it?"

"I didn't say that. I only said there Zas a Zall. I knoZ I retreated from yoX.
Why? HoZ can I remember? This Zas fifty years ago, 0omma, bXt
everything yoX said to me Zas, I felt, some sort of reprimand."

"9os? 5eperand?"

"I mean criticism. I had to stay aZay from yoXr criticism. Those years I Zas
feeling bad enoXgh aboXt myself as it Zas, and didn't need more criticism."

"What did yoX have to feel bad aboXt? All those years—

0omma  ana the 0eaning of /ife

Daddy and I Zorking in the store for yoX to stXdy. Till midnight. And hoZ
many times did yoX phone for me to bring home something for yoX? 3encils
or paper. 5emember Al? He Zorked in the liTXor store. The one Zho got his
face cXt dXring a robbery?"

"2f  coXrse, I remember Al, 0omma. The scar all the Zay doZn the front of
his nose."

"Well, Al  ZoXld ansZer the phone and alZays holler, right across the
croZded store, 'It's the king! The king is calling! /et  the king go bXy his
oZn pencils. The king coXld Xse a little e[ercise.' Al Zas jealoXs; his
parents gave him nothing. I never paid attention to Zhat he said. BXt Al Zas
right, I treated yoX like a king. Any time yoX called, day or night, I'd leave
Daddy Zith a store fXll of cXstomers and rXn doZn the block to 0ensch's
Five & Dime. Stamps, too, yoX needed. And notebooks, and ink. And then
ballpoint pens. All yoXr clothes smeared Zith ink. /ike a king. 1ot
criticism."

12
"0a,  Ze're talking noZ. And  that's good. /et's not accXse each other. /et's
Xnderstand. /et's jXst say I felt critici]ed. I knoZ yoX said good things aboXt
me to others. YoX bragged aboXt me. BXt yoX never said it to me. To my
face."

"1ot  so easy to talk to yoX then, 2yvin. And not jXst for me, for everybody.
YoX kneZ everything. YoX read everything. 0aybe people Zere a little
afraid of yoX. 0aybe me, too. 9er veys? Who knoZs. BXt let me tell yoXr
something, 2yvin, I had it voise than yoX. First, yoX never said anything
nice aboXt me, either. I kept hoXse, I cooked for yoX. TZenty years yoX ate
my food. YoX liked it, I knoZ, becaXse the plates and pots Zere alZays
empty. BXt yoX never told me. 1ot once in yoXr life. HXh? 2nce in yoXr
life?"

Ashamed, I coXld only boZ my head.

"Second, I kneZ that yoX didn't say anything nice behind my back—at least,
yoX had that, 2yvin, yoX kneZ that behind yoXr back I bragged aboXt yoX
to others. BXt I kneZ yoX Zere ashamed of me. Ashamed all the Zay
throXgh—in front of me and behind my back. Ashamed of my English, my
accent. 2f everything I didn't knoZ. And the things I said Zrong. I heard the
Zay yoX and

yoXr friends made rXn of me—--Xlie, Shelly, -erry. I heard everything.
HXh?"

I boZed my head loZer. "YoX never missed anything, 0omma."

"HoZ coXld I knoZ  anything that's in yoXr books? If I had a chance, if I
coXld have gone to school, Zhat I coXld have done Zith my head, my
saycbel? In 5Xssia, in the shted, I coXldn't go to school—only the boys."

"I knoZ, 0omma,  I  knoZ. I knoZ  yoX ZoXld have done as Zell as me in
school if yoX'd had the chance."

"I got off the boat Zith my mother and father. I Zas only tZenty. Si[  days a
Zeek I had to Zork in a seZing factory. TZelve hoXrs a day. Seven in the
morning to seven at night, sometimes eight. And, tZo hoXrs earlier, at five

13
in the morning, I had to Zalk my father to his neZspaper stand ne[t to the
sXbZay and help him Xnpack the papers. 0y brothers never helped. Simon
Zent to accoXntancy school. Hymie drived a cab—never came home, never
sent money. And then I married Daddy and moved to Washington and, Xntil
I Zas old, I Zorked side by side Zith him in  the store tZelve hoXrs a day
and cleaned the hoXse and cooked, too. And then I had -ean Zho never gave
me one minXte troXble. And then I had yoX. And yoX Zere not easy. And I
never stopped Zorking. YoX saZ me! YoX knoZ! YoX heard me rXnning Xp
and doZn the stairs. Am I lying?"

"I knoZ, 0omma."

"And all those years, as long as they lived, I sXpported BXbba and Zeyda.
They had nothing—the feZ pennies my father made from the paper stand.
/ater, Ze opened a candy store for him bXt he coXldn't Zork—the men had
to pray. YoX remember Zeyda?"

I nodded. "Faint memories, 0omma." I mXst have been foXr or five ... a
soXr-smelling tenement bXilding in the Bron[ . . . throZing scraps of bread
and balls of tinfoil doZn five  stories to the chickens in the coXrtyard . . . my
grandfather, all in black, tall black yarmXlke, Zhite Zild beard stained Zith
gravy, his arms and forehead Zrapped in black cords, mXmbling prayers.
We coXldn't

converse—he spoke only Yiddish—bXt he pinched my cheek hard.
Everyone else—BXbba, 0omma, AXnt /ena—Zorking, rXnning Xp and
doZn stairs all day to the store, Xnpacking and packing, cooking, cleaning
feathers from chickens, scales from fish, dXsting. BXt Zeyda didn't lift a
finger. -Xst sat and read. /ike a king.

"Every month," 0omma  keeps on, "I took the train to 1eZ York and
broXght them food and money. And later Zhen BXbba Zas in the nXrsing
home, I paid for the home and visited her every tZo Zeeks—yoX remember,
sometimes I took yoX on the train. Who else in the family helped? 1obody!

14
YoXr 8ncle Simon ZoXld come every feZ months and bring her a bottle of
 8p, and my ne[t visit all I ZoXld  hear aboXt Zas yoXr 8ncle Simon's
ZonderfXl  8p. Even Zhen she Zas blind, she'd lie there jXst holding the
empty  8p bottle. And not only BXbba I helped, bXt everyone else in the
family—my  brothers, Simon and Hymie, my sister /ena, Tante Hannah,
yoXr 8ncle Abe, the greenhorn, Zho I broXght from 5Xssia—everybody,
the Zhole family, Zas sXpported by that schmXt]ig, dirty, little grocery
store. 1obody helped me—ever! And no one ever thanked me."

Taking a deep, deep breath and Xttered the Zords: "I thank yoX, 0omma. I
thank yoX."

That isn't too hard. Why has it taken me fifty years? I take her arm, maybe
for the first time. The fleshy part jXst above the elboZ. It feels soft and
Zarm, something like her Zarm kichel doXgh jXst before baking. "I
remember yoXr telling -ean and me aboXt 8ncle Simon's  8p. That mXst
have been hard."

"Hard? YoX're telling me. Sometimes she'd drink his  8p Zith a piece of
my kichel—yoX knoZ Zhat a job making kichel is—and all she'd talk aboXt
Zas the  8p."

"It's good to talk, 0omma.  It's the first time. 0aybe I've  alZays Zanted it
and that's Zhy yoX stay in my mind and my dreams. 0aybe noZ it Zill be
different."

"Different hoZ?"

"Well, I'll  be able to be more myself—to live for the pXrposes

and caXses that I choose to cherish."

"YoX Zant to get rid of me?"

"1o—Zell,   not in that Zay, not in a bad Zay. I Zant the same for yoX too. I
Zant yoX to be able to rest.

15
"5est? Did yoX ever see me rest? Daddy napped every day. Ever see me
nap?"

"What I mean is yoX shoXld have yoXr oZn pXrpose in life— not this'' I say,
poking her shopping bag. "1ot my books! And I shoXld have my oZn
pXrpose."

"BXt I jXst e[plained," she replies, moving her shopping bag to her other
hand, aZay from me. "These aren't only yoXr books. These are my books,
too!"

Her arm, Zhich I'm still  clXtching, is sXddenly cold, and I release it.

"What do yoX mean," she goes on, "I shoXld have my pXrpose? These books
are my pXrpose. I Zorked for yoX—and for them. All my life I Zorked for
those books— my books." She reaches into her shopping bag and pXlls oXt
tZo more. I cringe, afraid she is going to hold them Xp and shoZ them to
the small croZd of bystanders Zho have noZ gathered aroXnd Xs.

"BXt yoX don't get it, 0omma. We've got to be separate—not fettered by
one another. That's Zhat it is to become a person. That's e[acdy Zhat I Zrite
aboXt in those books. That's hoZ I Zant my children—all children—to be.
8nfettered."

"9os meinen—Xnfeathered?"

"1o, no, Xnfettered —a Zord that means free or liberated. I'm not getting
throXgh to yoX, 0omma. /et me pXt it this Zay: every single person in the
Zorld is fXndamentally alone. It's hard, bXt that's the Zay it is and Ze have
to face it. So I Zant to have my oZn thoXghts and my oZn dreams. YoX
shoXld have yoXrs, too. 0omma, I Zant yoX oXt of my dreams."

Her face tightens sternly, and she steps back aZay from me. I rXsh to add,
"BXt not becaXse I don't like yoX, bXt becaXse I Zant Zhat's good for all of
Xs—for me and for yoX, too. YoX shoXld have yoXr oZn dreams in life, too.
SXrely voX can Xnderstand

that."

"2yvin,  still yoX think I  Xnderstand nothing and that yoX Xnderstand
everything. BXt I look, too, into life. And death. I Xnderstand aboXt death—

than yoX."

"BXt, 0omma, yoX don't face being alone. YoX stay Zith me. YoX don't
leave me. YoX Zander aboXt in my thoXghts. In my dreams."

"1o, Sonny."

"Sonny": I haven't heard name that for fifty years, have forgotten that's Zhat
she and my father often called me.

"It's not the Zay yoX think it is, Sonny," she continXes. "There's some things
yoX don't Xnderstand, some things yoX've got tXrned Xpside doZn. YoX
knoZ that dream, the one Zith me standing there in the croZd, Zatching
yoX in the cart Zaving to me, calling to me, asking me hoZ yoX did in life?"

"Yes, of coXrse, I remember my dream, 0omma. That's Zhere this all
started."

"YoXr dream? That's Zhat I Zant to say to yoX. That's the mistake, 2yvin—
yoXr thinking I Zas in yoXr dream. That dream Zas not yoXr dream, Sonny.
It Zas my dream. 0others get to have dreams, too"

A

s a medical stXdent, I Zas taXght the fine art of looking, listening, and
toXching. I looked at vermilion throats, bXlging eardrXms, and the

17
serpentine arterial rivXlets in the retina. I listened to the hiss of mitral
mXrmXrs, the gXrgling tXbas of the intestines, the cacophony of respiratory
rales. I felt the slippery edges of spleens and livers, the taXtness of ovarian
cysts, the marble hardness of prostatic cancer.

/earning aboXt patients—yes, that Zas the bXsiness of medical school. BXt
to learn from patients—that aspect of my higher edXcation came mXch later.
3erhaps it began Zith my professor, -ohn Whitehorn, Zho often said,
"/isten  to yoXr patients, let them teach yoX. To groZ Zise yoX mXst remain
a stXdent." And he meant mXch more than the banal trXth that the good
listener learns more aboXt the patient. He meant TXite literally that Ze

1

shoXld alloZ oXr patients to teach Xs.

A formal, aZkZard,  coXrtly man, Zhose gleaming pate Zas fringed Zith a
fastidioXsly clipped crescent of gray hair, -ohn Whitehorn Zas the
distingXished chairman of the -ohns Hopkins Department of 3sychiatry for
thirty years. He Zore gold-rimmed spectacles and had no sXperflXoXs
featXres—not a Zrinkle in his face, or in the broZn sXit he Zore every day
of the year (he mXst have, Ze sXrmised, tZo or three more identical ones in
his closet). And no sXperflXoXs e[pressions: Zhen he lectXred, his lips
moved; all else—hands, cheeks, eyebroZs—remained remarkably still.

DXring my third year of psychiatric residency, five classmates and I spent
every ThXrsday afternoon making roXnds Zith Dr. Whitehorn. Beforehand,
Ze had lXnch in his oak-paneled office. The fare Zas simple and Xnvarying
—sandZiches of tXna, cold cXts, and cold Chesapeake Bay crab cake,
folloZed by frXit  salad and flattened pecan pie—bXt served Zith SoXthern
elegance: linen table cloth, glistening silver trays, bone china. The lXnch
conversation Zas long and leisXrely. ThoXgh each of Xs had calls to retXrn
and patients clamoring for attention, there Zas no Zay to rXsh Dr.
Whitehorn; and Xltimately even I, the most frenetic of the groXp, learned to
pXt time on hold. In these tZo hoXrs, Ze had the opportXnity to ask oXr
professor anything: I remember asking him aboXt sXch matters as the
genesis of paranoia, a physician's responsibility to the sXicidal, the
incompatibility betZeen therapeXtic change and determinism. ThoXgh he

18
responded fXlly, he clearly preferred other sXbjects: the accXracy of 3ersian
archers, the comparative TXality of Greek versXs Spanish marble, the major
blXnders of the battle of GettysbXrg, his improved periodic table (he Zas
originally trained as a chemist).

After lXnch, Zhich XsXally lasted tZo hoXrs, Dr. Whitehorn began
intervieZing in his office  the foXr or five patients on his service Zhile Ze
silently observed. It Zas never possible to predict the length of each
intervieZ. Some lasted fifteen minXtes, many continXed for tZo or three
hoXrs. I most clearly remember the sXmmer months, the cool darkened
office, the orange- and green-

16

Travels Zith 3aXla

striped aZnings blocking oXt the fierce Baltimore sXn, the aZning posts
encircled by magnolia climbers Zhose fleecy blossoms dangled jXst oXtside
the ZindoZ. From the corner ZindoZ, I coXld jXst spot the edge of the
hoXse staff tennis coXrt. 2h hoZ I ached to play in those days! I fidgeted
and daydreamed aboXt aces and volleys as the shadoZs ine[orably
lengthened across the coXrt. 2nly Zhen dXsk had sZalloZed the very last
strands of tennis tZilight did I relinTXish all hope and rally give my
attention to Dr. Whitehorn's intervieZ.

His pace Zas leisXrely. He had plenty of time. 1othing interested him as
mXch as a patient's occXpation and avocation. 2ne Zeek he ZoXld be
encoXraging a SoXth American planter to talk for an hoXr aboXt coffee trees
and the ne[t Zeek it might be a history professor discXssing the failXre of
the Spanish Armada. YoX ZoXld have thoXght his paramoXnt pXrpose Zas
to Xnderstand the relationship betZeen altitXde and the TXality of the coffee
bean or the si[teenth-centXry political motives behind the Spanish Armada.
So sXbtly did he shift into more personal domains that I Zas alZays
sXrprised Zhen a sXspicioXs, paranoid patient sXddenly began to speak
frankly aboXt himself and his psychotic Zorld.

By alloZing  the patient to teach him, Dr. Whitehorn related to the person,
rather than the pathology, of that patient. His strategy invariably enhanced

19
both the patient's self-regard and Zillingness to be self-revealing.

A cXnning intervieZer, one might say. Yet "cXnning" it Zas not. There Zas
no dXplicity: Dr. Whitehorn genXinely Zanted to be taXght. He Zas a
collector and had in this manner over the years accXmXlated an astoXnding
treasXretrove of factXal cXrios. "YoX and yoXr patients both Zin," he ZoXld
say; "if yoX let them teach yoX enoXgh aboXt their lives and interests. /earn
aboXt their lives: yoX Zill not only be edified, bXt yoX Zill Xltimately learn
all yoX need to knoZ aboXt their illness."

Fifteen years later, in the early 190s, Dr. Whitehorn Zas dead, I had
become a professor of psychiatry, and a Zoman named 3aXla Zith advanced
breast cancer entered my life to continXe my

edXcation. ThoXgh I didn't knoZ it at the time and thoXgh she never
acknoZledged it, I believe that from the very beginning she assigned herself
the task of mentoring me.

3aXla had called for an appointment after having heard from a social Zorker
in the oncological clinic that I Zas interested in forming a therapy groXp of
patients Zith terminal disease. When she first entered my office, I Zas
instantaneoXsly captivated by her appearance: by the dignity in her bearing,
by her radiant smile Zhich gathered me in, by her shock of short,
e[Xberantly boyish, gloZing Zhite  hair, and by something I can only call
lXminosity, Zhich seemed to emanate from her Zise and intensely blXe
eyes.

She caXght my attention Zith her first Zords: "0y  name is 3aXla West," she
said. "I have terminal cancer. BXt / am not a cancer patient? And, indeed, in
my travels Zith her throXgh many years I never regarded her as a patient.
She Zent on to describe in clipped, precise fashion her medical history:
cancer of the breast diagnosed five years earlier; sXrgical removal of that
breast; then cancer of the other breast, that breast also removed. Then came
chemotherapy Zith its familiar aZfXl entoXrage: naXsea, vomiting, total loss
of hair. And then radiation therapy, the ma[imXm permitted. BXt nothing
ZoXld sloZ the spread of her cancer—to skXll, spine, and the orbits of her
eyes. 3aXla's cancer demanded to be fed, and thoXgh the sXrgeons tossed it

20
sacrificial offerings— her breasts, lymph nodes, ovaries, adrenal glands—it
remained voracioXs.

When I imagined 3aXla's nXde body, I saZ a chest crisscrossed Zith scars,
ZithoXt breasts, flesh, or mXscle, like the rib-planks of some shipZrecked
galleon, and beloZ her chest, a sXrgically scarred abdomen, and all
sXpported by thick, Xngainly, steroid-thickened hips. In short, a fifty-five-
year-old Zoman sans breasts, adrenals, ovaries, XterXs, and, I'm sXre, libido.

I have alZays relished Zomen Zith firm, gracefXl bodies, fXll breasts, and a
readily apparent sensXality. Yet the most cXrioXs thing happened to me the
first time I met 3aXla: I foXnd her beaXtifXl and fell in love Zith her.

18

Travels Zith 3aXla

We met Zeekly for a feZ months, in an irregXlar contractXal arrangement.
"3sychotherapy," an observer might have said, for I entered her name in my
professional appointment book and she sat in the patient's chair for the
ritXal fifty minXtes. Yet oXr roles Zere alZays blXrred. The TXestion of fees,
for e[ample, never arose. From the very beginning, I kneZ this Zas no
ordinary professional contract, and foXnd myself relXctant to mention
money in her presence—it ZoXld have been vXlgar. And not only money
bXt other sXch tasteless issXes as carnality, marital adjXstment, or social
relationships.

/ife,  death, spiritXality, peace, transcendence: those Zere the topics Ze
discXssed; those Zere 3aXla's only concerns. 0ostly Ze talked aboXt death.
Each Zeek, foXr of Xs, not tZo, met in my office—3aXla and I, her death
and my oZn. She became my coXrtesan of death: she introdXced me to it,
taXght me hoZ to think aboXt it, even to befriend it. I came to Xnderstand
that death has had a bad press. ThoXgh there is little joy to be foXnd in it,
still death is not a monstroXs evil that drags Xs off to some Xnimaginably
terrible place. I learned to demythologi]e death, to see it for Zhat it is—an
event, a part of life, the end of fXrther possibilities. "It's a neXtral event,"
3aXla said, "Zhich Ze've learned to color Zith fear."

21
Every Zeek 3aXla entered my office, flashed the broad smile I adored,
reached into her large straZ bag, lifted her joXrnal to her lap, and shared her
reflections and dreams of the past Zeek. I listened hard and tried to respond
appropriately. Whenever I voiced doXbts aboXt Zhether I Zas being helpfXl,
she seemed pX]]led; then after a moment's paXse, she smiled again as if to
reassXre me, and tXrned again to her joXrnal.

Together Ze relived her entire encoXnter Zith cancer: the initial shock and
disbelief, the mXtilation of her body, her gradXal acceptance, her getting
Xsed to saying, "I have cancer." She described her hXsband's loving care and
that of close friends. I coXld easily Xnderstand that: it Zas hard not to love
3aXla. (2f coXrse I never declared my love Xntil mXch later, at a time Zhen

she Zas not to believe me.)

Then she described the horrible days of her cancer's recXrrence. That phase
Zas her Calvary, she said, and the stations of the cross Zere the trials
e[perienced by all patients Zith recXrrence: radiotherapy rooms Zith
doomsday metallic eyeball sXspended aloft, impersonal harried technicians,
Xncomfortable friends, aloof doctors, and, most of all, the deafening hXsh of
secrecy everyZhere. She cried Zhen she told me aboXt calling her sXrgeon,
a friend of tZenty years, only to be informed by his nXrse that there Zere to
be no fXrther appointments since the doctor had nothing more to offer.
"What is Zrong Zith  doctors? Why don't they Xnderstand the importance of
sheer presence?" she asked me. "Why can't they reali]e that the very
moment they have nothing else to offer is the moment they are most
needed?"

The horror in learning of one's sickness Xnto death, I learned from 3aXla, is
intensified many times over by the ZithdraZal of others. The isolation of
the dying patient is e[acerbated by the foolish charade of those Zho attempt
to conceal the approach of death. BXt death cannot be concealed; the clXes
are XbiTXitoXs: the nXrses speak in hXshed tones, the roXnding doctors often
pay attention to the Zrong parts of the body, the medical stXdents tiptoe into
the hospital room, the family smiles bravely, visitors attempt cheeriness. A
patient Zith cancer once told me that she kneZ death Zas near Zhen her
doctor, Zho had alZays conclXded his physical e[am Zith a playfXl pat on
her fanny, ended his e[am Zith a Zarm handshake.

22
0ore  than death, one fears the Xtter isolation that accompanies it. We try to
go throXgh life tZo by tZo, bXt each of Xs mXst die alone—no one can die
oXr death Zith Xs or for Xs. The shXnning of the dying by the living
prefigXres final absolXte abandonment. 3aXla taXght me hoZ the isolation of
the dying Zorks tZo Zays. The patient cXts herself off from the living, not
Zanting to drag family or friends into her horror by revealing her fears or
her macabre thoXghts. And friends shrink aZay, feeling helpless, aZkZard,
Xncertain of Zhat to say or do, and relXctant to get too

20

Travels Zith 3aXla

close to a previeZ of their oZn death.

BXt 3aXla's isolation Zas noZ at an end. If nothing else, I Zas constant.
ThoXgh others had abandoned 3aXla, I ZoXld not. HoZ good that she had
foXnd me! HoZ coXld I have knoZn then that the time ZoXld come Zhen
she ZoXld consider me her 3eter, denying her not once bXt many times?

She coXld find no sXitable Zords to describe the bitterness of her isolation,
a period she often referred to as her Garden of Gethsemane. 2nce, she
broXght me a lithograph draZn by her daXghter, in Zhich several highly
styli]ed silhoXette figXres are stoning a saint, a single tiny croXching
Zoman Zhose frail arms cannot protect her from the hail of granite. It still
hangs in my office, and Zhenever I see it, I think of 3aXla saying, "I am that
Zoman, helpless before the onslaXght."

It Zas an Episcopalian priest Zho helped her find her Zay oXt of the Garden
of Gethesmane. Familiar Zith the Zise aphorism of 1iet]sche, the
Antichrist: "He Zho  has a 'Zhy' can pXt Xp Zith any 'hoZ,'" the priest
reframed her sXffering. "YoXr cancer is yoXr cross," he told her." YoXr
sXffering is yoXr ministry."

That formXlation—that "divine illXmination"—as 3aXla called it, changed
everything. As she described her acceptance of her ministry and her
dedication to easing the sXffering of individXals stricken Zith cancer, I
began to Xnderstand my assigned role: she Zasn't my project, I Zas hers, the

23
object of her ministry. I coXld help 3aXla, bXt not throXgh sXpport,
interpretation, or even caring or fidelity. 0y  role Zas to alloZ her to
edXcate me.

Is it possible that someone Zhose days are limited, Zhose body is infiltrated
Zith cancer, can e[perience a "golden period"? 3aXla did. It Zas she Zho
taXght me that embracing death hon-esdy permits one to e[perience life in a
richer, more satisfying manner. I Zas skeptical. I sXspected that her talk of a
"golden period" Zas overdone, her typical spiritXal hyperbole. "Golden?
5eally? 2h, come noZ, 3aXla, hoZ can there be anything golden aboXt
dying?"

"Irv," 3aXla chided, "that's the Zrong TXestion! Try to Xnder-

stand that Zhat's golden is not the dying bXt the fXll living of life in the face
of death. Think of the poignancy and precioXsness of last times: the last
spring, the last flight of dandelion flXff, the last shedding of Zisteria
blossoms."

"The golden period is also," 3aXla said, "a time of great liberation—a time
Zhen yoX have the freedom to say 20 to all trivial obligations, to devote
yoXrself Zholly to Zhatever yoX most care aboXt— the presence of friends,
the changing seasons, the rolling sZell of the sea." She Zas deeply critical
of Eli]abeth .Xbler-5oss,  medicine's high priestess of death, Zho, failing to
recogni]e the golden stage, developed a negativistic clinical approach.
.iibler-5oss's  "stages" of dying—anger, denial,bargaining. depression,
acceptance—never failed to aroXse 3aXla's ire. She insisted, and I am
certain that she Zas correct, that sXch rigid categori]ing of emotional
responses leads to a dehXmani]ation of both patient and doctor.

3aXla's golden period Zas a time for intense personal e[ploration: she had
dreams of Zandering throXgh enormoXs halls and discovering in her hoXse
neZ, XnXsed rooms. And it Zas a time of preparation: she had dreams of
cleaning her hoXse from basement to attic and of reorgani]ing bXreaXs and
closets. She prepared her hXsband efficiently and lovingly. There Zere
times, for e[ample, Zhen she felt strong enoXgh to shop and cook bXt
deliberately refrained in order to train him to be more self-sXfficient. 2nce,
she told me that she Zas very proXd of him becaXse he had for the first time

24
referred to "my" rather than "oXr retirement." At sXch times I sat Zide-eyed
in disbelief. Was she on the level? Did sXch virtXe really e[ist oXtside the
Dickensian Zorld of 3eggotty, /ittle  Dorrit,  and the ChX]]leZits?
3sychiatric te[ts rarely discXss the personality trait of "goodness" e[cept to
label it a defense against darker impXlses; and at first, I TXestioned her
motives Zhile poking aroXnd as XnobtrXsively as possible looking for flaZs
and chinks in the facade of saintliness. Finding none, I eventXally
conclXded it Zas no facade and, calling off my search, alloZed myself to
bask in 3aXla's grace.

3reparation for death, 3aXla believed, is vital and reTXires

22

Travels Zith 3aXla

e[plicit  attention. 8pon learning that her cancer had spread to her spine,
3aXla prepared her thirteen-year-old son for her death by sending him a
letter of fareZell that moved me to tears. In her final paragraph she
reminded him that the lXngs in the hXman fetXs do not breathe, nor do its
eyes see. ThXs the embryo is being prepared for an e[istence it cannot yet
imagine. "Are Ze not, too," 3aXla sXggested to her son, "being prepared for
an e[istence beyond oXr ken, beyond even oXr dreams?"

I have alZays been baffled by religioXs belief. As long as I can remember, I
have regarded it as self-evident that religioXs systems develop in order to
provide comfort and soothe the an[ioXsness of oXr hXman condition. 2ne
day Zhen I Zas tZelve or thirteen and Zorking in my father's grocery store,
I talked of my skepticism aboXt the e[istence of God Zith a second Zorld
Zar soldier Zho had jXst retXrned from the EXropean front. In response, he
gave me a crinkled, faded pictXre of the 9irgin 0ary and -esXs Zhich he
had carried Zith him throXghoXt the 1ormandy invasion. "TXrn it over," he
said. "5ead the back. 5ead it aloXd."

"'There are no atheists in fo[holes,"' I read.

"5ight!  There are no atheists in fo[holes," he repeated sloZly, shaking his
finger at me Zith every Zord. "Christian God, -eZ  God, Chinese God, any

25
other God— hXt some god, by God! Can't do ZithoXt it."

Given to me by a total stranger, that crinkled pictXre fascinated me. It had
sXrvived 1ormandy and Zho knoZs hoZ many other battles. 3erhaps, I
thoXght, it is an omen; perhaps Divine 3rovidence has finally foXnd me. For
tZo years I carried that pictXre in my Zallet, every so often pXlling it oXt
and pondering it. And then one day I asked, "So? What if it is trXe that there
are no atheists in fo[holes? If anything, that sXpports the skeptical position:
of coXrse, belief increases Zhen fear is greatest. That's the very point: fear
begets belief; Ze need and Zant a god, bXt Zishing doesn't make it so.
Belief, no matter hoZ fervent, hoZ pXre, hoZ consXming, says nothing
Zhatsoever aboXt the reality of God's e[istence. The ne[t dav in a
bookstore, I dreZ the noZ-

poZerless pictXre oXt of my Zallet and—I Zas carefXl Zith it, for it
deserved respect—inserted it in the leaves of a book entitled 3eace of 0ind,
Zhere perhaps some other embattled soXl might find it and make better Xse
of it.

AlthoXgh the idea of dying had long filled me Zith dread, I came to prefer
the raZ dread to some absXrd belief Zhose chief appeal lay in its very
absXrdity. I have alZays hated the impregnable declaration "I believe
becaXse it is absXrd." Yet, as a therapist, I keep sXch sentiments to myself: I
knoZ that religioXs faith is a poZerfXl soXrce of comfort, and never tamper
Zith a belief if  I have no better replacement.

0y  agnosticism has rarely Zavered. 2h, perhaps a feZ times in school
dXring morning prayer, I ZoXld feel TXeasy at the sight of all my teachers
and classmates, heads boZed, Zhispering to the 3atriarch above the cloXds.
Has everyone bXt me gone mad? I Zondered. And then there Zere those
neZspaper photos of the beloved Franklin Delano 5oosevelt attending
chXrch every SXnday—those gave me paXse: FD5's beliefs had to be taken
very serioXsly.

BXt Zhat of 3aXla's vieZs? What of her letter to her son, of her belief in a
pXrpose aZaiting Xs that Ze cannot anticipate? FreXd ZoXld have been
amXsed at 3aXla's metaphor—and in the religioXs arena, I have alZays
agreed Zith him entirely. "Wish fXlfillment, pXre and simple," he ZoXld

26
have said. "We Zish to be, Ze dread nonbeing, and Ze invent pleasant fairy
tales in Zhich all oXr Zishes come trXe. The XnknoZn pXrpose aZaiting Xs,
the endXring soXl, Heaven, immortality, God, reincarnation—all illXsions,
all sZeeteners to cXt the bitters of mortality."

3aXla alZays responded gently to my skepticism and softly reminded me
that thoXgh I thoXght her beliefs Zere implaXsible, they Zere impervioXs to
disproof. Even so, I liked 3aXla's metaphors and listened to her preachifying
Zith more tolerance than I ever had to anyone before. 3erhaps it Zas simply
barter, me trading a small corner of my skepticism for a closer snXggle Zith
3aXla's grace. At times, I even heard myself moXthing little

24

Travels Zith 3aXla

phrases like: "Who knoZs?" "Where, after all, does certainty lie?" "Can Ze
ever really knoZ?" I envied her son. Does he reali]e hoZ blessed he is?
HoZ I longed to be the son of sXch a mother.

AroXnd this time, I attended the fXneral service of a friend's mother in
Zhich the priest offered a story of consolation. He described a congregation
of people on a shore Zho sadly Zave goodbye as a ship sails aZay. The ship
diminishes in si]e Xntil only the rip of its mast is visible. When that, too,
vanishes, the onlookers mXrmXr, "She's gone." At that very instant,
hoZever, someZhere far aZay, another groXp of people are scanning their
hori]on and, seeing the tip of a mast appear there, e[ciaim, "She's come!"

"A silly  fable," I might have snorted in my pre-3aXla days. Yet noZ I felt
less condescending. As I looked aroXnd at my felloZ moXrners, I felt for a
brief moment at one Zith them, bonded together in illXsion, all of Xs
gloZing at the image of the ship nearing the shores of a neZ life.

Before 3aXla, no one had been TXicker than I to ridicXle the flaky California
landscape. The 1eZ Age hori]on Zent on forever: Tarot, I Ching, body
Zork, reincarnation, SXfi, channeling, astrology, nXmerology- acXpXnctXre,
Scientology, 5olfing, holotrophic breathing, past-lives therapy. 3eople have
alZays needed these pathetic beliefs, I Xsed to think. They ansZer a deep

27
longing and some people are too Zeak to stand alone. /et them have their
fairy tales, poor children! 1oZ  I e[pressed my opinions more gently-Softer
phrases noZ came to my lips: "Who can tell?" "0aybe!" "/ife   is comple[
and XnknoZable."

After 3aXla and I had met for many Zeeks, Ze began to make concrete
plans to form a groXp for dying patients. 1oZadays, sXch groXps are
commonplace and mXch discXssed in maga]ines and television; bXt in I93,
there Zas no precedent for one: dying Zas as heavily censored as
pornography. Hence Ze had to improvise every step of the Zay. The
beginning posed a major hXrdle. HoZ to start sXch a groXp? HoZ to recrXit
groXp members? With a classified ad: "Wanted! Dying people"?

BXt 3aXla's netZork Zith her chXrch, hospital clinics, and

home-care organi]ations began to yield potential groXp members. The
Stanford renal dialysis Xnit referred the first, -im, a nineteen-year-old Zith
severe kidney disease. ThoXgh he mXst have knoZn that his life span Zas
short, he had little interest in deepening his acTXaintance Zith death. -im
avoided eye contact Zith 3aXla and me and, for that matter, any form of
engagement—Zith anyone. "I'm a man ZithoXt a fXtXre," he said. "Who
ZoXld Zant me as a hXsband or a friend? Why keep facing the pain of
rejection? I've talked enoXgh. Been rejected enoXgh. I'm doing okay ZithoXt
anyone." 3aXla and I saZ him only tZice; he did not retXrn for a third
session.

-im, Ze conclXded, Zas too healthy. 5enal dialysis offers too mXch hope,
postponing death so long that denial takes root. 1o, Ze needed the doomed,
the short-timers on death roZ, those ZithoXt hope.

Then 5ob and Sal came throXgh oXr door. 1either of them met oXr
TXalifications precisely: 5ob often denied that he Zas dying, and Sal
claimed that he had already come to terms Zith his illness and needed no
help from Xs. 5ob, only tZenty-seven, had lived for si[ months Zith a
highly malignant brain tXmor. /Xrching in and oXt of denial, he ZoXld
insist, at one moment, "YoX'll see, I'll be backpacking in the Alps in si[
Zeeks. (I don't believe poor 5ob had ever been east of 1evada), and, a feZ
moments later, cXrse his paraly]ed legs for preventing him from searching

28
for his life insXrance policy: "I've got to find oXt Zhether the benefits to my
Zife and kids Zill  be canceled if I commit sXicide."

AlthoXgh Ze kneZ Ze Zere not large enoXgh, Ze started a groXp of foXr—
3aXla, Sal, 5ob, and I. Since Sal and 3aXla needed no help and I Zas the
therapist, 5ob became the groXp's raison d'etre. BXt 5ob obstinately refXsed
to give Xs mXch satisfaction. We tried to offer him comfort and gXidance
Zhile respecting his choice to deny. SXpporting denial, hoZever, is an
Xnsatisfying, dXplicitoXs endeavor, especially Zhen Zhat Ze Zanted Zas to
help 5ob accept his dying and get the most of Zhat life he had left. 1one of
Xs looked forZard to oXr meetings. After tZo months,

26

Travels Zith 3aXla

5ob's headaches greZ more severe, and one night he died TXietly in his
sleep. I doXbt Ze Zere XsefXl to him.

Sal greeted death in a very different manner. His spirit e[panded as his life
dreZ to a close. His imminent death flooded his life Zith a meaning he had
never previoXsly knoZn. 0Xltiple myeloma, an e[traordinarily  painfXl
bone-invasive cancer, Zas Sal's disease; he had fractXred many bones and
Zas encased in a fXll body cast from neck to thigh. So many people loved
Sal that it Zas hard to believe he Zas only thirty. /ike 3aXla, he had been, at
a time of greatest despair, transformed by the stXnning idea that his cancer
Zas his ministry. This revelation determined everything Sal did
sXbseTXently in life, even agreeing to enter the groXp: he felt it might
provide a forXm to help others find some transcendent meaning in their
illness.

AlthoXgh Sal entered oXr groXp si[ months too early, Zhen it Zas still too
small to give him the aXdience he deserved, he foXnd other platforms—
primarily high schools, Zhere he addressed troXbled teenagers. "YoX Zant
to corrXpt yoXr body Zith drXgs? Want to kill it Zith boo]e, Zith  grass, Zith
cocaine?" his voice thXndered throXgh the aXditoriXm. "YoX Zant to smash
yoXr body in aXtos? .ill it? ThroZ  it off  the Golden Gate Bridge? YoX don't

29
Zant it? Well, then, give me yoXr bodyl /et me have it. I need it. I'll take it
—I Zant to live!"

It Zas an e[traordinary appeal. I trembled Zhen I heard him speak. The
force of his delivery Zas aXgmented by the particXlar poZer that Ze alZays
give to the Zords of the dying. The stXdents listened in hXshed silence,
sensing, as I did, that he Zas speaking trXly, that he had no time for game
playing or pretense or fear of conseTXences.

Evelyn's arrival in the groXp a month later provided Sal Zith another
opportXnity to Zork at his ministry. Si[ty-tZo  years old, embittered, and
gravely ill Zith  leXkemia, Evelyn Zas Zheeled into the groXp Zith a blood
transfXsion in process. She Zas candid aboXt her illness. She kneZ she Zas
dying: "I can accept that," she said, "it no longer matters. BXt Zhat does
matter is my daXghter. She is poi-

soning my final days!" Evelyn reviled her daXghter, a clinical psychologist,
as "a vindictive, Xnloving Zoman." 0onths  earlier, they had had a bitter and
foolisn argXment after her daXghter, caring for Evelyn's cat, had fed it the
Zrong food. Since then they had not spoken to one another.

After hearing her oXt, Si \ spoke to her simply and passionately, "/isten to
Zhat I have to say, Evelyn. I'm dying, too.. What does it matter Zhat yoXr
cat ea~s? What does it matter Zho gives in first? YoX knoZ yoX don't have
mXch time left. /et's stop pretending. YoXr daXghter's love is the most
important thing in the Zorld to yoX. Don't die, please don't die, ZithoXt
telling her that! It Zill  poison her life, she'll never recover, and she'll pass
on the poison to her daXghter! Break the cycle! Break the cycle, Evelyn!"

The appeal Zorked. AlthoXgh Evelyn died a feZ days later, the Zard nXrses
told Xs that, sZayed by Sal's Zords, she had had a tearfXl reconciliation Zith
her daXghter. I Zas very proXd of Sal. It Zas oXr groXp's first triXmph!

TZo more patients joined, and after several months, 3aXla and I Zere
persXaded that Ze had learned enoXgh to begin Zorking Zith larger
nXmbers of patients. 1oZ she began to recrXit in earnest. Her contacts Zith
the American Cancer Society soon generated a nXmber of referrals. After

30
Ze had intervieZed and accepted seven neZ patients, all Zith breast cancer,
Ze officially  opened oXr groXp for bXsiness.

At oXr first fXll-si]ed groXp meeting 3aXla sXrprised me Zhen she began the
session by reading aloXd an old Hasidic tale:

A rabbi had a conversation Zith the /ord aboXt .  >aven and Hell. "I Zill
shoZ yoX Hell," said the /ord and led the . "bbi into a room containing a
large roXnd table. The peopi^ sitting aroXnd the table Zere famished and
desperate. In the m idle of the table Zas an enormoXs pot of steZ Zhich
smelled s.: delicioXs that the rabbi's moXth Zatered. Each person aroXnd
the table held a spoon Zith a very long handle. AlthoXgh the long spoons
jXst reached the pot, their handles Zere longer than ZoXld-be diners' arms:
thXs, Xnable to bring food to their lips,

28

Travels Zith 3aXla

no one coXld eat. The rabbi saZ that their sXffering Zas terrible indeed.

"1oZ  I Zill   shoZ yoX Heaven," said the /ord, and they Zent into another
room, e[actly the same as the first. There Zas the same large roXnd table,
the same pot of steZ. The people, as before, Zere eTXipped Zith the same
long-handled spoons—bXt here everyone Zas Zell noXrished and plXmp,
laXghing and talking. The rabbi coXld not Xnderstand. "It is simple, bXt it
reTXires a certain skill," said the /ord. "In this room, yoX see, they have
learned to feed each other."

AlthoXgh 3aXla's independent decision to start the session by reading the
parable threZ me off balance, I let it pass. That's her Zay, I thoXght,
knoZing that Ze had not yet Zorked oXt oXr roles and oXr collaboration in
the groXp. Besides, her jXdgment Zas impeccable—it remains to this day
the most inspired beginning of a groXp I have ever Zitnessed.

What to name the groXp? 3aXla sXggested the "Bridge GroXp." Why? TZo
reasons. First, the groXp created a bridge from one cancer patient to another.

31
Second, it Zas a groXp Zhere Ze pXt oXr cards on the table. Hence, the
Bridge GroXp. A typical 3aXla toXch.

2Xr "flock,"  as 3aXla called it, greZ rapidly. 1eZ, terror-stricken faces
appeared every Zeek or tZo. 3aXla took the neZ members in hand, inviting
them oXt to lXnch, teaching, charming, and spiritXali]ing them. Soon Ze
Zere so large Ze had to split into tZo groXps, and I introdXced some
psychiatric residents as co-leaders. All the members resisted the splitting; it
threatened the integrity of the family. I sXggested a compromise: Ze ZoXld
meet as tZo separate groXps for an hoXr and a TXarter and then, in the final
fifteen minXtes, ZoXld merge so that the tZo groXps coXld inform one
another of the details of their meeting.

The meetings Zere poZerfXl and dealt, I believe, Zith issXes that Zere more
painfXl than any groXp had ever dared to face before. 0eeting after
meeting, members came in Zith neZ metastases, neZ tragedies; and each
time Ze foXnd a Z r ay to offer pres-

ence and comfort to each stricken person. 2ccasionally, if someone Zere
too Zeak, too close to death to attend, Ze ZoXld hold the groXp meeting in
that member's bedroom.

There Zas no topic too difficXlt for the groXp to discXss, and 3aXla played
an important role in every critical discXssion. 2ne meeting, for e[ample,
began Zith a member named Eva speaking of envying a friend Zho had,
that Zeek, very sXddenly and very Xne[pectedly died in her sleep of a
coronary. "That's the best Zay to go," Eva proclaimed. BXt 3aXla took issXe
Zith Eva and sXggested that instant death is a tragic death.

I felt embarrassed for 3aXla. Why, I Zondered to myself, is she compelled
to commit herself to sXch lXdicroXs positions? Who coXld disagree Zith
Eva's position that dying in yoXr sleep is a good Zay to go? With her XsXal
persXasiveness, hoZever, 3aXla gracefXlly elaborated on her point of vieZ
that sXdden death is the Zorst death. "YoX need time, mXch XnhXrried time,"
she said, "to prepare others for yoXr death—yoXr hXsband, friends and,
most of all, yoXr children. YoX need to attend to life's Xnfinished bXsiness.
For sXrely yoXr projects are important enoXgh not to be discarded casXally.

32
They deserve to be completed or resolved. 2therZise, Zhat meaning does
yoXr life contain?

"FXrthermore," she conclXded, "dying is a part of life. To miss it, to sleep
throXgh it, is to miss one of life's great adventXres."

Eva, herself a formidable presence, Zas, hoZever, to have the final Zord.
"Say Zhat yoX Zant, 3aXla, I still envy my friend's sXdden death. I've
alZays loved sXrprises."

The groXp soon became Zell knoZn in the Stanford commXnity. StXdents—
psychiatric residents, nXrses, classes of XndergradXates—began observing
the meetings throXgh the one-Zay mirror. Sometimes the pain in the groXp
Zas too mXch to bear, and stXdents ran from the observation room in tears.
BXt they alZays retXrned. AlthoXgh psychotherapy groXps often permit
observation by stXdents, it is alZays grXdgingly. 1ot this groXp: they
Zelcomed it. /ike  3aXla, the members Zere eager for stXdents; they felt that
they had mXch to teach, and that their death sentences had made them

30

Travels Zith 3aXla

Zise. They had learned one lesson particXlarly Zell: that life cannot be
postponed; it mXst be lived noZ, not sXspended Xntil the Zeekend, Xntil
vacation, Xntil the children leave for college, Xntil the diminished years of
retirement. 0ore than once, I heard the lament, "What a pity it is that I had
to Zait till  noZ, till  my body Zas riddled Zith  cancer, to learn hoZ to live."

At that time I Zas consXmed Zith sXcceeding in the academic Zorld, and
my fren]ied schedXle of research, grant applications, lectXring, teaching,
and Zriting limited  my contact Zith 3aXla. Was I Zas afraid of getting too
close to her? 3erhaps her cosmic perspective, her detachment from
TXotidian goals, threatened the Xnderpinnings of my dedication to sXccess
in the academic marketplace. 2f coXrse, I saZ her Zeekly in the groXp,
Zhere I Zas the titXlar leader and 3aXla—that Zas she?—not a co-therapist,
bXt something else—a coordinator, or co-facilitator, or liaison. She oriented
neZ members to the groXp, made certain they Zere Zelcomed, shared her

33
personal e[periences, phoned all members dXring the Zeek, took them oXt
to lXnch, and Zas available to anyone in crisis.

3erhaps "spiritXal consXltant" is the best Zay to describe 3aXla's role. She
elevated and deepened the groXp. Whenever she talked, I listened
attentively: 3aXla alZays had Xne[pected insights. She taXght the members
hoZ to meditate, hoZ to reach deep Zithin themselves, hoZ to find a center
of tranTXillity, hoZ to contain pain. 2ne day, as a meeting Zas aboXt to
close, she sXrprised me by taking a candle oXt of her bag, lighting it, and
setting it on the floor. "/et's move closer together," she said, stretching oXr
her hand to the member on either side of her, "look at the candle, and
meditate for a feZ moments in silence."

Before I met 3aXla, I Zas so deeply ensconced in the medical tradition that
I'd not have had charitable thoXghts aboXt a therapist Zho ended groXp
sessions Zith the members holding hands and staring silently at a candle.
Yet 3aXla's sXggestion felt so right to the members, and to me, that Ze
began to end each meeting in that fashion. I came to treasXre those closing
moments and, if I happened to be sitting ne[t to 3aXla, ZoXld give her hand
a Zarm

sTXee]e before I relinTXished it. She generally led the meditation aloXd,
improvising, alZays Zith  great dignity. I loved her meditations, and to the
end of my life, I Zill  hear her TXiedy instrXcting Xs: "/et go, let go of anger,
let go of pain, let go of self-pity. 5each into yoXr center, into yoXr TXiet,
peacefXl depths and open yoXrself Xp to love, to forgiveness, to God."
Heady stXff for an Xptight, free-thinking, medically trained empiricist!

Sometimes I Zondered Zhether 3aXla had any needs beyond the need to
help others. ThoXgh I often asked her Zhat the groXp coXld do for her, I
never got an ansZer. Sometimes I Zondered aboXt her oZn bXsy pace—she
visited several sick patients every day. What drives her? I asked myself, and
Zhy does she present her problems only in the past tense? She offers Xs
only her solXtions, never her Xnsolved problems. BXt I never Zondered too
long. After all, 3aXla did have advanced metastatic cancer and had oXtlived
even the most optimistic statistics. She Zas energetic, Zidely loved, Zidely
loving, an inspiration to everyone forced to live Zith cancer. What more
coXld one ask?

34
This Zas the golden period of my travels Zith 3aXla. 3erhaps I shoXld have
let things remain there. BXt one day I looked aroXnd and observed hoZ
large the entire enterprise Zas getting—groXp leaders, secretarial help to
transcribe sXmmaries of intakes and meetings, teachers to meet Zith stXdent
observers. SXch si]e needs capital, I decided, and began searching for
research fXnding to keep the groXp afloat. Since I did not Zant to think of
myself as being in the death profession, I had never charged any of the
patients or even inTXired aboXt medical insXrance. 1onetheless, I Zas
devoting considerable energy and time to the groXp, and I had a moral
obligation to Stanford 8niversity to help cover the salary it Zas paying me.
I also felt that my clinical apprenticeship in leading groXps of cancer
patients Zas coming to an end; it Zas time to do something Zith this
enterprise, to research it, to evalXate its effectiveness, to pXblish oXr resXlts,
to spread the Zord, to encoXrage similar programs elseZhere in the coXntry.
In short, it Zas time to promote it and to get promoted.

32

Travels Zith 3aXla

A propitioXs opportXnity appeared Zhen the 1ational Cancer InstitXte sent
oXt a call for applications for social-behavioral breast cancer research. I
applied sXccessfXlly for a grant enabling me to evalXate the effectiveness of
my therapeXtic approach to the terminal breast cancer patient. It Zas a
simple, straightforZard project. I felt confident that my treatment approach
improved the TXality of life of the terminally ill patient, and that I had only
to develop an evalXation component—the administration of TXestionnaires
before members entered the groXp and at regXlar intervals thereafter.

1otice that I noZ  begin to make more Xse of the first-person pronoXn: "I
decided ... I applied .. . my treatment approach." As I look back and sift
throXgh the ashes of my relationship Zith 3aXla, I sXspect that these first-
person pronoXns foreshadoZed the corrXption of oXr love. BXt as I lived
throXgh this period, I Zas XnaZare of even the most sXbtle spoilage. I
remember only that 3aXla filled me Zith light, and that I Zas her rock, the
haven for Zhich she had searched before Ze tZo Zere lXcky enoXgh to have
foXnd each another.

35
2f  one thing I am certain: it Zas shortly after the fXnded research officially
began that things started to go Zrong. First, small hairline cracks, then
crevices began to appear in oXr relationship. 3erhaps the first clear sign that
something Zas amiss Zas 3aXla's telling me one day that she felt e[ploited
by the research project. I thoXght this a cXrioXs remark becaXse I had tried
in every Zay possible to make her role in the project jXst Zhat she
reTXested: she intervieZed all the neZ candidates for the groXps, all Zomen
Zith metastatic breast cancer, and helped in the constrXction of the
evalXation TXestionnaires. FXrthermore, I made sXre she Zas Zell paid—far
more than the average research assistant and more than she had reTXested.

A feZ Zeeks later, in a distXrbing conversation, she told me that she felt
overZorked and yearned for more time for herself. I felt sympathetic and
tried to offer sXggestions for redXcing her frenetic pace.

Shortly afterZard, I sXbmitted to the 1ational Cancer InstitXte mv Zritten
report of the first stage of the research. ThoXgh I made sXre to list 3aXla's
name first among the list of the research associates, I soon heard a rXmor
that she Zas dissatisfied aboXt the amoXnt of credit she had received. I
made the mistake of paying this rXmoXr little heed: it seemed
Xncharacteristic of 3aXla.

A short time later, I introdXced Dr. .ingsley into one of the groXps as a co-
therapist—a yoXng, female psychologist Zho, thoXgh ine[perienced in
Zorking Zith  cancer patients, Zas e[traordinarily intelligent,
Zellintentioned, and dedicated. Soon 3aXla soXght me oXt. "That Zoman,"
she scolded, "is the coldest, most Xngiving person I've ever encoXntered.
1ot in a thoXsand years Zill she be able to help any of the patients."

I Zas astonished—both by her gross misperception of the neZ co-therapist
and by her bitter, condemning tone. Why so harsh 3aXla? I thoXght. Why so
Xncompassionate, so Xnchristian?

The research grant stipXlated that, dXring the first si[ months of fXnding, I
hold a tZo-day Zorkshop to consXlt Zith a panel of si[ e[perts in cancer
treatment, research design, and statistical analysis. I also invited 3aXla and
foXr other groXp members to attend as patient consXltants. The Zorkshop
Zas pXre ZindoZ-dressing, a flagrant Zaste of time and money. BXt sXch is

36
life in the field of federally sponsored contractXal research: one simply
learns to accommodate to these charades. 3aXla, hoZever, coXldn't
accommodate. CalcXlating the amoXnt of money spent in the tZo-day
meeting (appro[imately five thoXsand dollars), she railed at me aboXt the
immorality of the Zorkshop: "Think  of the help that five thoXsand dollars
coXld provide for cancer patients!"

3aXla, I thoXght, I do love yoX bXt yoX can be so mXddle-headed. "Can't
yoX see," I said, "that compromise is necessary. There's no Zay that five
thoXsand dollars can be Xsed for direct patient care. 0ore important, Ze'll
lose oXr fXnding if Ze don't folloZ federal gXidelines for a consXltation
Zorkshop. If Ze can persevere, complete the research, demonstrate the
valXe of oXr approach to dying cancer patients, Ze Zill benefit more
patients, many more,

34

Travels Zith 3aXla

than coXld be directly helped by the five thoXsand dollars. /et's not be
penny-Zise and poXnd-foolish, 3aXla. Compromise, please," I pleaded, "this
one time."

I coXld sense her disappointment Zith me. Shaking her head sloZly, she
replied, "Compromise once, Irv? 1o sXch thing as a single compromise.
They breed."

DXring the Zorkshop the consXltants all made the contribXtion for Zhich
they had been recrXited (and Zere Zell paid). 2ne discXssed psychological
testing to measXre depression, an[iety, modes of coping, locXs of control;
another talked aboXt healthcare delivery systems; another aboXt commXnity
resoXrces.

3aXla threZ herself fXlly into the Zorkshop. I assXme she felt that, Zith
little time left one doesn't play a Zaiting game. She, the only
nonprofessional in attendance, acted the Socratic gadfly to the solemn
consXltant panel. When, for e[ample, they discXssed sXch objective
evalXation indices of maladaptive coping as a patient's not getting oXt of

37
bed, not dressing, ZithdraZing, and crying, 3aXla argXed that, for her, each
of these activities Zas at times a stage of incXbation, Zhich eventXally
Xshered in another stage, sometimes a period of groZth. She rejected the
e[perts' attempts to convince her that Zhen one Xses a large enoXgh sample,
aggregate scores, and a control groXp, sXch considerations can be easily
dealt Zith statistically in the data analysis.

Then came the moment Zhen the Zorkshop participants Zere asked to
sXggest important antecedent variables: that is, factors that might predict a
person's psychological adjXstment to cancer. Dr. /ee, a cancer specialist,
Zrote these on the blackboard as the participants called them oXt: marital
stability, available environmental resoXrces, personality profile, family
history. 5aising her hand, 3aXla sXggested, "HoZ aboXt coXrage? And
spiritXal depth?"

Deliberately, ZithoXt speaking, Dr. /ee looked over at her, all the Zhile
tossing chalk in the air and catching it a coXple of times. Finally, he tXrned
and Zrote 3aXla's sXggestions on the board. AlthoXgh I thoXght them not
Xnreasonable, I kneZ—and kneZ that everyone else kneZ—that, as Dr. /ee
Zatched the tXmbling chalk,

he Zas thinking, Somebody, anybody, please, get that old lady oXt of here!
/ater at lXnch he referred to 3aXla contemptXoXsly as an evangelist.
AlthoXgh I needed his sXpport for the necessary nXmber of patients, I risked
antagoni]ing him, and defended her staXnchly bv emphasi]ing her critical
importance in the formation and fXnctioning of the groXps. ThoXgh I failed
to alter his impression of her, I felt proXd of myself for standing by her.

That evening 3aXla phoned me. She Zas fXrioXs. "All of the medical
professionals at the Zorkshop are aXtomatons, inhXmane aXtomatons. We
patients Zho strXggle Zith cancer tZenty-foXr hoXrs a day—Zhat are Ze to
them? I'll tell yoX: Ze are nothing more than 'maladaptive coping
strategies'." I spoke Zith her a long time and did all that I coXld to mollify
her. I tried to sXggest, gendy, that she not stereotype the doctors, and Xrged
her to be patient. Affirming my loyalty to the principles Zith  Zhich Ze
started the groXp, I conclXded. "5emember, 3aXla, none of this makes any
difference, becaXse I have my oZn research plan. I'm not going to be
controlled by their mechanistic perspective. TrXst me!"

38
BXt 3aXla Zas not to be mollified; nor, as it tXrned oXt, ZoXld she trXst me.
The Zorkshop festered in her mind. For Zeeks she rXminated aboXt it and
finally directly  accXsed me of selling oXt to the bXreaXcracy. She sXbmitted
a minority report of one to the 1ational Cancer InstitXte, and it did not lack
vigor or rancor.

Finally, one day, 3aXla came into my office and annoXnced that she had
decided to leave the groXp.

"Why?"

"Well, I'm jXst tired of it."

"3aXla, there's more to it than that. What's the real reason?"

"I told yoX, I'm tired of it."  1o matter hoZ I  probed, she continXed to insist
on that e[cXse, thoXgh Ze both kneZ that the real reason Zas that she Zas
disenchanted Zith me. I Xsed all my cXnning (and after all my years of
practice, I kneZ a feZ Zays to get aroXnd people), bXt to no avail. Each of
my attempts, inclXding some ill-advised bantering and appeals to oXr long
friendship, Zas greeted by an icy glare. I had no more rapport Zith her and
had to

36

Travels Zith 3aXla

endXre the sorroZ of a deceptive discXssion.

"I'm jXst Zorking too hard. It's too mXch for me," she said.

"Isn't that Zhat I've been saying for months, 3aXla? CXt doZn all yoXr visits
and phone calls to the do]ens of patients on yoXr roll. Simply come to the
groXp. The groXp needs yoX. And I need yoX. SXrely ninety minXtes a Zeek
isn't too mXch."

"1o, I  can't do things piecemeal. I need a clean break. Besides the groXp
isn't Zhere I am anymore. It's too sXperficial. I need to go deeper—to Zork
Zith symbols, dreams, and archetypes."

39
"I agree, 3aXla." I Zas by this time very sobered. "It's Zhat I Zant, too, and
Ze're jXst noZ breaking that groXnd in the groXp."

"1o, I'm  too tired, too drained. Each neZ patient forces me to relive my
oZn time of crisis, my oZn Garden of Gethsemane. 1o, I've decided: ne[t
Zeek Zill  be my last meeting."

And it Zas. 3aXla never retXrned to the groXp. I asked her to call me at any
time if she Zanted to talk. She replied that it Zas also possible for me to call
her. AlthoXgh she Zasn't being malicioXs, her comment shifted the frame
and stXng me sharply. She never called me again. I phoned her a feZ times
and tZice took her to lXnch. The first lXnch (Zhich Zas so painfXl that it
Zas many months before I called her for another) began ominoXsly-Finding
the restaXrant of oXr choice croZded, Ze Zent across the street to Trotter's,
a hXge cavernoXs strXctXre, Xtterly ZithoXt grace, Zhich had had many
previoXs lives: an 2ldsmobile dealership, a natXral foods grocery store, a
dance parlor. 1oZ it Zas a restaXrant featXring a menX of "dance"
sandZiches—the Walt], the TZist, the Charleston.

1o, it Zas not right, I  felt it Zasn't right  Zhen I heard myself order a HXla
sandZich, and kneZ it Zasn't Zhen 3aXla opened her pXrse, e[tracted a
rock, aboXt the si]e of a small grapefrXit, and placed it on the table betZeen
Xs.

"0y  anger rock," she said. From this point, my memory is
Xncharacteristically spotty. FortXnately, I took some notes after oXr lXnch—
my conversations Zith 3aXla being too important to me to be entrXsted to
memory.

"Anger rock?" I repeated blankly, transfi[ed by the lichen-covered boXlder
sitting on the tabie betZeen Xs.

"I've been bXffeted aboXt so mXch, Irv, that I've been sZalloZed by anger.
1oZ  I've pXt the anger aZay. Into this rock. I had to bring it today. I Zanted
it here Zhen I met yoX."

"Why are yoX angry Zith me, 3aXla?"

40
"I'm no longer angry. There's too little time left to be angry. BXt I've been
hXrt, I've been deserted Zhen I needed help most of all."

"I've never deserted yoX, 3aXla," I said, bXt she didn't acknoZledge my
comment, and Zent on.

"After the Zorkshop, I Zas shattered. /ooking  at Dr. /ee standing there
tossing that chalk in the air, ignoring me, ignoring the hXman concerns of
all patients, I felt the Zhole Zorld give Zay  Xnder me. 3atients are hXman.
We strXggle. Sometimes Ze strXggle Zith great coXrage against cancer.
2ften Ze talk  aboXt Zinning or losing oXr fight—it is a fight. Sometimes
Ze're plXnged into despair, sometimes into sheer physical e[haXstion, and
sometimes Ze rise above oXr cancer. We are not 'coping strategies.' We are
mXch, mXch more than that."

"BXt 3aXla, that Zas Dr. /ee—that's not me. That's not the Zay I felt. I
defended yoX Zhen I spoke to him later, I've told yoX that. After all oXr
Zork together, can yoX believe that I consider yoX nothing more than a
coping strategy? I hate that langXage and that perspective as mXch as yoX
do!"

"YoX knoZ, I'm really not going to retXrn to the groXp."

"That's not the point, 3aXla." And it Zasn't. It Zas no longer of Xrgent
concern to me Zhether she retXrned to the groXp. While she had been a
great force there, I had come to reali]e that she had been almost too
poZerfXl and too inspiring: her leaving had made it possible for several
other patients to groZ and to learn to inspire themselves. "What's most
important to me is that yoX trXst me and care for me."

"After the Zorkshop, Irv, I  cried for tZenty-foXr hoXrs. I called yoX. YoX
did not call back that day. /ater, Zhen yoX did, yoX offered

41
me no comfort. I Zent to chXrch to pray and had a three hoXr talk Zith
Father Elson. He listened to me. He alZays listens to me. I think he saved
me."

Damn that priest! I strained to recollect that day three months ago. I
vagXely remembered speaking to her on the phone, bXt not her asking for
help. I had been certain she Zas phoning to gripe some more aboXt the
Zorkshop, Zhich I'd already discXssed Zith her several times. Too many
times. Why coXldn't she get it? HoZ often did I have to tell her that the
Zhole damn thing Zas meaningless, that / Zasn't Dr. /ee, that / hadn't
tossed the chalk, that I had defended her against him later, that I Zas going
to continXe the groXp in the same Zay, that nothing ZoXld change e[cept
that the groXp members ZoXld be asked to fill oXt a feZ TXestionnaires
every three months? Yes, 3aXla had called me that day, bXt not then, not
ever, had she asked me for help.

"3aXla, if yoX had told me yoX Zanted help for yoXrself, do yoX think I'd
have refXsed yoX?"

"I cried for tZenty-foXr  hoXrs."

"BXt I'm not a mind reader. YoX told me yoX Zanted to talk aboXt the
research and yoXr minority report."

"I cried for tZenty-foXr  hoXrs."

And so it Zent, the tZo of Xs speaking past each another. I did my best to
reach her. I told her I needed her—for myself, not for the groXp. Indeed, I
did need her. There Zere issXes in my life troXbling me at the time, and I
yearned for her inspiration and her soothing presence. 2nce, several months
before, I had called 3aXla one evening, ostensibly to discXss oXr plans for
the groXp, bXt in reality becaXse my Zife Zas oXt of toZn and I Zas feeling
lonely and an[ioXs. After oXr phone conversation, Zhich Zent on for over
an hoXr, I felt mXch better—thoXgh slightly gXilty for having gotten therapy
on the sly.

I thoXght noZ aboXt that long healing phone conversation Zith 3aXla. Why
hadn't I been more honest? Why hadn't I simply said, "/ook here, 3aXla,

42
can I talk to yoX tonight? Can yoX help me—I'm feeling an[ioXs, lonely,
driven? I'm having troXble

sleeping." 1o, no, oXt of the TXestion! I prefer to take my noXrishment
secretly.

HoZ hypocritical, therefore, for me to have demanded that 3aXla ask help
from me openly. So she'd covertly asked for help, Xsing a cover story aboXt
the Zorkshop? So Zhat! I shoXld have tried to comfort her ZithoXt insisting
she genXflect.

As I contemplated 3aXla's anger rock, I reali]ed hoZ little chance there Zas
of salvaging oXr relationship. Certainly this Zas no time for sXbtlety and I
opened Xp to her as never before. "I need yoX," I said, reminding her, as
often before, that therapists, too, have needs. "And perhaps," I Zent on, "I
haven't been sensitive enoXgh to yoXr distress. Yet I'm not a mind reader,
and haven't yoX for years refXsed all my offers to help yoX?" What I Zanted
to say Zas, "Give me another chance. Even if this one time I didn't pick Xp
on yoXr distress, 3aXla, don't leave forever." BXt I had come close enoXgh to
begging that day. 3aXla Zas adamant, and Ze parted ZithoXt toXching.

I pXt 3aXla oXt of mind for many months Xntil Dr. .ingsley, the yoXng
psychologist to Zhom she had taken sXch an irrational dislike, told me of a
disagreeable encoXnter she had had Zith 3aXla. She had retXrned to the
groXp Dr. .ingsley  Zas leading (Ze noZ had several groXps in the project)
and—soXnding like "0rs. Cancer," as the psychologist pXt it—had
monopoli]ed the session Zith a speech. I immediately phoned 3aXla and
invited her to lXnch again.

I Zas sXrprised hoZ pleased 3aXla seemed by my invitation, bXt as soon as
Ze met—this time at the Stanford FacXlty ClXb, Zhich serves no HXla
sandZiches—her agenda became clear. She coXld talk of nothing else bXt
Dr. .ingsley.  According to 3aXla, Dr. .ingsley's  co-therapist had invited
her to address their groXp bXt that, as soon as she began speaking, Dr.
.ingsley  accXsed her of taking too mXch time. "YoX've got to reprimand
her," 3aXla said Xrgently. "YoX knoZ teachers can and shoXld be held
responsible for the Xnprofessional behavior of their stXdents." BXt Dr.
.ingsley  Zas my colleagXe, not my stXdent, and I had knoZn her

43
40

Travels Zith 3aXla

for years. 1ot only Zas her hXsband a close friend, bXt she and I had co-led
many groXps: knoZing her to be a sXperb therapist, I Zas certain that
3aXla's accoXnt of her behavior Zas greatly distorted.

SloZly, far too sloZly,  it daZned on me that 3aXla Zas jealoXs: jealoXs of
the attention and affection I bestoZed on Dr. .ingsley; jealoXs of my
alliance Zith her and Zith all the members of the research staff. 1atXrally
3aXla had resisted the consXltation Zorkshop; natXrally she had discoXraged
any collaboration Zith other researchers. She ZoXld resist any change. All
she Zanted Zas to revert to the time Zhen she and I had been alone Zith
oXr little flock.

What coXld I do? Her insistence that I choose betZeen her and Dr.
.ingsley,  placed me in an impossible dilemma. "I care for both, yoX and Dr.
.ingsley,  3aXla. HoZ can I maintain my oZn integrity and my collegiality
and friendship Zith Dr. .ingsley   ZithoXt yoXr feeling, once again,
abandoned by me?" ThoXgh I reached oXt to her in every Zay possible, the
distance betZeen Xs greZ greater. I coXld find no proper Zords, there
seemed to be no safe topics. I no longer had the right to ask her personal
TXestions, nor did she evince any interest in my life. We ate oXr lXnch
ZithoXt the personal interchange I had hoped for.

All throXgh lXnch, she told me stories aboXt terrible mistreatment by the
doctors: "They ignore my TXestions, their medications do more harm than
good." She also Zarned me aboXt a psychologist Zho Zas talking to some
of the cancer patients Zho had been in oXr groXp: "He's stealing oXr
findings to Xse in his oZn book. YoX'd better protect yoXrself, Irv."

3aXla Zas obvioXsly deeply troXbled, and I Zas alarmed and saddened by
her paranoia. I think my distress mXst have shoZed becaXse, as I moved to
leave, she asked me to stay a feZ minXtes more.

"I have a story for yoX, Irv. Sit back and let me tell yoX aboXt the coyote
and the locXst."

44
She kneZ I loved stories. Especially her stories. I listened

e[pectantly.

There Zas once a coyote Zho felt overZhelmed by the pressXres in his life.
All he coXld see Zere too many hXngry cXbs, too many hXnters, too many
traps. So one day he ran off to be alone. SXddenly he heard the notes of a
sZeet melody, a melody of Zell-being and great peacefXlness. FolloZing
the song to a clearing in the forest, he came Xpon a large locXst sXnning
himself on a holloZ log and singing.

"Teach me yoXr song," the coyote asked the locXst. 1o response. Again, he
demanded to be taXght the song. BXt the locXst remained silent. Finally,
Zhen the coyote threatened to gobble him Xp, the locXst acTXiesced and
sang the sZeet song over and over again Xntil the coyote had memori]ed it.
HXmming his neZ song, the coyote started back to his family. SXddenly a
flock of Zild  geese fleZ Xp and distracted him. When he had recovered his
Zits he opened his moXth to sing again bXt foXnd he had forgotten the song.

So he tXrned back to the sXnny clearing in the forest. BXt by this time, the
locXst had molted, floZn onto a tree branch, and left his empty skin sXnning
on the same holloZ log. The coyote Zasted no time making sXre that he had
the song permanently inside him. In one gXlp he sZalloZed the locXst skin
thinking that the locXst Zas still Zithin. Starting home, again he discovered
he did not knoZ the song. He reali]ed he coXld not learn it from ingesting
the locXst. He ZoXld have to let the locXst oXt and force it to teach him.
Taking a knife, he cXt into his abdomen to release the locXst. He cXt so deep
that he died.

"And so, Irv," 3aXla said, giving me her lovely, beatific smile, reaching oXt
for my hand, and then Zhispering into my ear, "yoX've got to find yoXr oZn
song to sing."

I Zas very moved: her smile, her mystery, her stretch for Zisdom—that Zas
the 3aXla I loved so mXch. I liked the parable. It Zas vintage 3aXla, it felt
like old times. I took the meaning at face valXe—that I shoXld sing my oZn
song—and pXshed aZay the

45
42

Travels Zith 3aXla

story's darker and distXrbing implications aboXt my relationship Zith her. I
have refXsed, even to this day, to e[amine it too deeply.

And so Ze each sang oXr songs separately. 0y career progressed: I
condXcted research, Zrote many books, received the academic reZards and
promotions I so coveted. Ten years Zent by. The breast cancer project that
3aXla had helped laXnch had long been completed, and the findings from it
pXblished. We had offered groXp therapy to fifty Zomen Zith metastatic
breast cancer and foXnd that, compared Zith thirty-si[ control patients, the
groXp had vastly improved the TXality of the patients' remaining life. (Years
later, in a folloZ-Xp stXdy pXblished in /ancet, my colleagXe, Dr. David
Spiegel, Zhom I had asked many years before to become the project's
principal investigator, Xltimately demonstrated that the groXp had
significantly lengthened the lives of the members.) BXt the groXp Zas noZ
history; all of the thirty Zomen in the original Bridge  GroXp and the eighty-
si[ Zomen in  the metastatic breast cancer stXdy had died.

All bXt one. 2ne day, in the hospital corridor, a yoXng Zoman Zith red hair
and a flXshed face hailed me, said, "I bear greetings from 3aXla West."

3aXla! CoXld it be? 3aXla still alive? And I hadn't even knoZn. I shXddered
to think that I had become a person Zho Zas XnaZare of Zhether a spirit
like hers Zas alive or dead.

"3aXla? HoZ is she?" I stammered oXt. "HoZ do yoX knoZ her?"

"TZo years ago Zhen I Zas diagnosed as having lXpXs, 3aXla came to visit
me and introdXced me into her lXpXs self-help groXp. Ever since, she's been
taking care of me—indeed, the Zhole lXpXs commXnity."

"I'm sorry to hear aboXt yoXr illness. BXt 3aXla? /XpXs? I hadn't heard."
What hypocrisy, I thoXght. HoZ coXld I have heard? Had I even once called
her?

46
"She says it Zas caXsed by the medicine she Zas given for cancer."

"Is she verv sick?"

"YoX never knoZ Zith 3aXla. Certainly not too sick to start a lXpXs sXpport
groXp, to invite all the neZ lXpXs patients to lXnch, to visit Xs Zhen Ze're
too ill to leave the hoXse, to arrange a series of medical speakers to keep Xs
apprised of neZ research in lXpXs. Also, not too sick to laXnch a medicai-
ethics-board investigation of her cancer doctors."

2rgani]ing,  edXcating, nXrsing, agitating, starting Xp lXpXs self-help groXps,
castigating her doctors—soXnded like 3aXla all right.

I thanked the yoXng Zoman and, later that day, dialed 3aXla's nXmber,
Zhich I still  kneZ by heart even thoXgh it had been a decade since I had last
called. As I Zaited for her to ansZer, I thoXght of some recent geriatric
research that shoZed a positive correlation betZeen personality style and
longevity: cantankeroXs patients Zho are paranoid, vigilant, and assertive
tend to live longer. Better a feisty, irritating, living 3aXla, I thoXght, than a
placid dead one!

She seemed glad to hear from me. Since the lXpXs had, she said, made her
sXn-sensitive, she rarely ventXred oXt to restaXrants in the daytime, bXt Zhy
not come to lXnch Zith her at her home? I accepted gladly. The day of oXr
lXnch, I foXnd 3aXla, in her front garden. Wrapped in linen from head to toe
and Zearing an enormoXs broad-brimmed beach hat, she Zeeding a
beaXtifXl patch of tall, fragrant Spanish lavender. "This disease is probably
going to kill me, bXt I'm not going to let it keep me oXt of my garden,"
3aXla said, clasping my arm and escorting me inside. She led me to a dark
pXrple velvet sofa and, sitting doZn ne[t to me, immediately began on a
serioXs note. "It's been ages since I've seen yoX, Irv, bXt I think of yoX often.
YoX're mXch in my prayers."

"I like yoXr thinking of  me, 3aXla. BXt as for yoXr pravers, yoX knoZ my
shortcomings there."

"Yes, yes, I reali]e that in this one area, yoX have yet to open yoXr mind. It
reminds me," she said, smiling, "that my job Zith yoX isn't yet complete. Do

47
yoX remember the last time Ze talked

44

Travels Zith 3aXla

aboXt God? It's years ago, bXt I remember yoXr telling me that my feeling of
the holy Zas not mXch different from gas pains in the night!"

"2Xt of conte[t  that soXnds harsh, even to me. BXt I didn't mean to be
insXlting. I only meant that a feeling is merely a feeling. A sXbjective state
can never sXbstantiate an objective trXth. A Zish, a fear, a sense of aZe, of
the tremendXm, doesn't mean that—"

"Yes, yes" 3aXla interrXpted me Zith a smile, "I knoZ yoXr hard-line
materialist litany. I've heard it many times, and I've alZays been strXck by
the amoXnt of passion, of devoXtness, of faith yoX pXt into it. I remember
that in oXr last conversation yoX told me yoX had never had a close friend,
never knoZn anyone Zhose mind yoX respected, Zho Zas a devoXt
believer."

I nodded.

"Well, there's something I shoXld have said to yoX then. YoX forgot one
friend Zho is a believer—me! HoZ I  Zish I coXld introdXce yoX to the
holy! HoZ  strange that yoX phoned noZ becaXse I've been thinking mXch
aboXt yoX the last tZo Zeeks. I've jXst retXrned from a tZo-Zeek chXrch
retreat in the Sierras and I so mXch Zish I coXld have taken yoX Zith me.
Sit back, and let me tell yoX aboXt it.

"2ne morning Ze Zere  asked to meditate Xpon someone Zho had died,
some beloved person from Zhom Ze really hadn't parted. I chose to think of
my brother Zhom I had loved very mXch, bXt Zho died at seventeen Zhen I
Zas still a child. We Zere asked to Zrite a letter of fareZell telling that
person all the important things Ze had never said. 1e[t Ze searched in the
forest for an object symboli]ing that person to Xs. Finally Ze Zere to bXry
the object together Zith the letter. I chose a small granite boXlder and bXried
it in the shade of a jXniper. 0y brother Zas like a rock—solid, steadfast. If

48
he had lived, he ZoXld have sXpported me. He ZoXld never have passed me
by."

3aXla looked in my eyes as she said this, and I started to lodge a protest.
BXt she pXt her finger on my lips and continXed.

"That night at midnight the monastery  bells chimed for the per-

son each of Xs had lost. There Zere tZenty-foXr of Xs on the retreat, and the
bells rang tZenty-foXr times. Sitting in my room, hearing the first bell, I
e[perienced, really e[perienced, my brother's death and a Zave of
indescribable sadness descended Xpon me as I thoXght of all the e[periences
he and I together had had and also those Ze never had. Then a strange thing
happened: as the bells continXed to toll, I thoXght, Zith each sXbseTXent
chime, of member of oXr Bridge GroXp Zho had died. When the chimes
stopped, I had remembered tZenty-one. And all dXring the tolling I cried. I
cried so hard that one of the nXns heard me, came into my room, pXt her
arms aroXnd me and held me.

"Irv, do yoX remember them? Do yoX remember /inda and BXnny—"

"And Eva and /ily."  I  felt my oZn tears come, as I joined her in recalling
the faces and the stories and the pain of oXr first groXp members.

"And 0adeline  and Gabby."

"And -Xdy and -oan."

"And Evelyn and 5obin."

"And Sal and 5ob,"

Holding one another and rocking gendy, 3aXla and I continXed oXr dXet, oXr
dirge, Xntil Ze had inXrned the names of tZenty-one of oXr little family.

"This is a holy moment, Irv," she said breaking aZay and looking in my
eyes. "Can't yoX feel the presence of their spirits?"

49
"I remember them so clearly, and I feel yoXr presence, 3aXla. That's holy
enoXgh for me."

"Irv, I knoZ  yoX Zell. 0ark  my Zords—the  day Zill  come Zhen yoX
reali]e hoZ religioXs yoX really are. BXt it's Xnfair trying to convert yoX
Zhile yoX're hXngry. I'll get lXnch."

"Wait one moment, 3aXla." I had something to ask before letting her get Xp.
"A feZ  minXtes ago, Zhen yoX said yoXr brother Zas one Zho ZoXld never
have passed yoX by, Zas that statement meant for me?"

"2nce," said 3aXla, looking at me Zith her lXminoXs eyes, "at

46

Travels Zith 3aXla

a time Zhen I needed yoX badly, yoX did desert me. BXt that Zas then. It's
gone. YoX've come back noZ."

I Zas certain I kneZ the then she meant—the time Zhen Dr. /ee tossed that
chalk into the air. HoZ mXch time for the flight of that chalk? 2ne second?
TZo? BXt those brief moments Zere fro]en in her memory. I'd need an ice
pick to hack them oXt. I Zas not so foolish as to try. Instead, I retXrned to
her brother.

"YoXr saying that yoXr brother Zas like a rock makes me think of another
rock, the anger rock yoX placed on the table betZeen Xs the last time Ze
met. Do yoX knoZ that yoX've never, Xntil this day, mentioned yoXr brother
to me, bXt his death helps me Xnderstand some things aboXt the tZo of Xs.
0aybe Ze've alZays  been a threesome—yoX, me, and yoXr brother? I
Zonder if his death is the reason yoX've chosen to be yoXr oZn rock—the
reason yoX ZoXld never let me be yoXr rock? 3erhaps his death convinced
yoX that other men ZoXld prove frail and Xnreliable?"

I stopped and Zaited. HoZ ZoXld she respond? In all the years I had knoZn
3aXla, this Zas the first time I had offered her an interpretation aboXt
herself. BXt she said nothing. I continXed, "I think I'm right, and I think it's

50
good that yoX Zent on this retreat, good that yoX tried to say good-bye to
him. 0aybe things can be different betZeen yoX and me noZ."

0ore  silence. Then, Zith an enigmatic smile, she stood Xp saying, "1oZ it's
time to feed yoX," and Zalked into the kitchen.

Was that statement—"1oZ it's time to feed yoX"—an acknoZledgment that
I had jXst fed her? Damn, it Zas hard to give her anything!

A moment later, Zhen Ze sat doZn to eat, she looked directly at me and
said, "Irv, I'm in troXble. Will yoX be my rock noZ?"

"2f  coXrse," I said, glad to recogni]e her plea as the ansZer to my TXestion.
"/ean on me. What kind of troXble?" BXt my pleasXre in being alloZed at
last to help tXrned TXickly to dismay as she began to e[plain her troXble.

"I've been so oXtspoken aboXt the doctors that I think I've been medically
blacklisted. I can't get good medical care any

longer. All the doctors of the /archZood Clinic  are in on it. Yet I can't
sZitch clinics—my  insXrance forces me to get my treatment there. And
Zith my medical condition, Zhat other insXrance company ZoXld toXch
me? I'm convinced they've treated me Xnethically—their treatment is
responsible for my lXpXs. There's been definite malpractice! They're afraid
of me! They Zrite some of my medical notes in red ink so they can TXickly
identify and remove them from my chart in case of a sXbpoena. They're
Xsing me as a gXinea pig. They deliberately Zithheld steroids Xntil it Zas
too late. Then they abXsed the dosage.

"I honestly think they Zant me oXt of the Zay," 3aXla continXed. "I spent
this entire Zeek composing a letter e[posing them to the medical board. Yet
I haven't mailed it—mainly becaXse I began to Zorry aboXt Zhat Zill
happen to the doctors and to their families if they lose their licenses. 2n the
other hand, hoZ can I alloZ them to continXe injXring patients? I cannot
compromise. I remember once telling yoX that a compromise cannot e[ist
alone: it breeds, and before long yoX have lost Zhat yoX most dearly
believe. And silence here, noZ, is a compromise! I've been praying for
gXidance."

51
0y  dismay rose. 0aybe there Zas some small crystal of trXth in 3aXla's
charges. 0aybe some of her doctors Zere, like Dr. /ee many years before,
so pXt off by her manner as to dismiss her. BXt charts Zritten in red ink,
gXinea pig trials, Zithholding necessary medication? These Zere absXrd
accXsations, and I Zas certain they Zere signs of paranoia. I kneZ some of
these doctors and believed in their integrity. 2nce again she placed me in
the position of having to choose betZeen her strong beliefs and my strong
beliefs. 0ore than anything, I did not Zant her to believe I Zas deserting
her. Yet I coXld find no Zay of staying Zith her.

I felt trapped. Finally, after all these years, 3aXla Zas making a direct appeal
to me. I coXld see only one Zay to respond: to consider her a highly
distXrbed individXal and treat her—"treat" in the dark, false sense of the
Zord, in the sense of "handling." That had been Zhat I had alZays Zanted
to avoid Zith 3aXla—as Zith

48

Travels Zith 3aXla

anyone, for that matter—becaXse "handling" someone is to relate to him or
her as an object and, thXs, the antithesis of being Zith that person.

So I empathi]ed Zith her dilemma. I listened, probed gently, and kept my
opinions to myself. Finally, I sXggested that she Zrite a softer letter to the
medical board: "Honest bXt softer," I said. "Then the doctors Zill get only a
reprimand rather than a license forfeitXre." All this, of coXrse, Zas in bad
faith. 1o medical board in the Zorld Zas going to take her letter serioXsly.
1o one Zas going to believe that all the clinic physicians Zere conspiring
against her. There Zas no possibility of either reprimand or revoking of
license.

She lapsed into thoXght, Zeighing my advice. I believe she felt my caring
for her, and I hoped she ZoXld not knoZ that I Zas being false. Finally, she
nodded, "YoX've given me good soXnd coXnsel, Irv. It's jXst Zhat I needed."
I felt painfXlly the irony that it Zas only noZ,  Zhen I had acted in bad faith,
that she considered me helpfXl and trXstZorthy.

52
Despite her sensitivity to the sXn, 3aXla insisted on Zalking Zith me to my
car. She pXt on her sXn hat, Zrapped herself in her veil and linens, and, as I
started the ignition, leaned into the car ZindoZ to give me a last hXg. As I
drove aZay, I looked back throXgh the rearvieZ mirror. SilhoXetted against
the sXn, her hat and linen Zrapping gleaming Zith light, 3aXla seemed
incandescent. A bree]e came Xp. Her clothes flXttered. She seemed a leaf,
trembling, tZisting on its stem, readying itself for the fall.

In the ten years before this visit, I had dedicated myself to my Zriting. I
tXrned oXt book after book—a prodXctivity dXe to a simple strategy: I pXt
the Zriting first  and let no thing and no one interfere Zith it. GXarding my
time as fiercely as a mother bear gXards her cXbs, I eliminated all bXt
absolXtely essential activities. Even 3aXla fell into the nonessential
category, and I did not take the time to call her again.

Several months later, my mother died and, Zhile I Zas flying to her fXneral,
3aXla slipped into my mind. I thoXght of her

fareZell letter to her dead brother—the letter containing all the things she
had never said to him. And I thoXght of Zhat I had never said to my mother.
Almost everything! 0y  mother and I, thoXgh loving one another, had never
spoken direcdy, heart to heart, as tZo people reaching oXt Zith clean hands
and clear minds. We had alZays "treated" each another, spoken past each
other, each of Xs fearing, controlling, deceiving the other. I'm certain that's
Zhy I had alZays Zanted to speak honesdy and direcdy to 3aXla. And Zhy I
hated being forced to "treat" her falsely.

The night after the fXneral, I had a poZerfXl dream. 0y mother and several
of her friends and relatives, all dead, are seated very still, very TXiedy, on a
flight of stairs. I hear my mother's voice calling—shrieking—my name. I
am particXlarly aZare of AXnt 0inny, sitting on the top stair, Zho shordy
before the dream, had died from the aftermath of a cataclysmic stroke,
Zhich had completely paraly]ed her for several months, and left her Xnable
to move a mXscle in her body aside from her eyes. In my dream she is at
first very still, then begins to move, sloZly at first, then more and more
TXickly Xntil she is vibrating faster than a bXmblebee. At that point,
everyone on the stairs, all the big people of my childhood, all dead, begin to
vibrate. 0y  8ncle Abe reaches oXt to pinch my cheek, clXcking, "Darling

53
Sonny," as he Xsed to do. Then others reach oXt for my cheeks. At first
affectionate, the pinching groZs fierce and painfXl. I aZake in terror, cheeks
throbbing, at three in the morning.

The dream seemed to be a dXel Zith death. First, I am called by my dead
mother and see all the dead of my family sitting in eerie stillness on the
stairs. Then I try to negate deathly TXiescence by infXsing the movement of
life. BXt no sooner does my paraly]ed AXnt 0innie begin to move than she
veers oXt of control and into fren]y. 1e[t I try  to soothe my dread of the
dead by imagining them affectionately pinching my cheeks. BXt that dread
breaks throXgh once again, the pinching groZs fierce and malignant, and I
am overZhelmed Zith death an[iety.

The image of my aXnt vibrating like a bXmblebee haXnted me

0

Travels Zith 3aXla

for days. I coXldn't shake it loose. 3erhaps, I thoXght, it is a message telling
me that my oZn fren]ied life pace is bXt a clXmsy attempt to TXell death
an[iety. Is the dream not telling me to sloZ doZn and attend to the things I
really valXe?

The idea of valXe broXght 3aXla back to mind again. Why hadn't I called
her? She Zas one Zho had faced death and stared it doZn. I remembered
the Zay she had gXided the meditation at the end of oXr meetings: her eyes
fi[ed  on the candle flame, her sonoroXs voice leading me into deeper,
TXieter regions of myself. Had I ever told her hoZ mXch those moments
meant to me? So many things I never said to her. I ZoXld say them noZ. 2n
the plane ride home from my mother's fXneral, I resolved to reneZ my
friendship Zith her.

BXt I never did. Too mXch to do: Zife, children, patients, stXdents, Zriting. I
Zrote my page a day and ignored all else— friends, mail, phone calls,
invitations to lectXre. Everything, all the other parts of my life, ZoXld Zait
Xntil the book Zas finished. And 3aXla, too, ZoXld have to Zait.

54
3aXla, of coXrse, did not Zait. A feZ months later, I received a note from
her son—the boy I envied for having 3aXla as a mother, the son to Zhom
years before she had so ZonderfXlly Zritten of her approaching death. He
Zrote simply, "0y   mother died, and I an certain she ZoXld have Zanted me
to let voX knoZ."

SoXthern Comfort

I

pXt in my time. Five years. For five years I led a daily therapy groXp on a
psychiatric Zard. At ten every morning I left my co]y  book-lined office in
the Stanford 8niversity 0edical  School, bicycled over to the hospital,
entered the Zard, Zinced at my first breath of sticky /ysol-laced air, and
poXred my coffee from the staff caffeinated Xrn (no caffeine for the patients,
nor tobacco, alcohol, or se[—all part of an effort, I sXppose, to discoXrage
them from settling too comfortably and too long into the hospital). Then I
arranged the chairs into a circle in the mXltipXrpose room, Xnpocketed my
baton, and for eighty minXtes condXcted a groXp therapy meeting.

ThoXgh the Zard had tZenty beds, my meetings Zere small, sometimes
only foXr or five patients. I Zas picky aboXt my clientele and opened my
doors only for higher-fXnctioning patients.

C2

The ticket of admission? 2rientation times three: time, place, and person.
0y  groXp members had only to knoZ Zhen it Zas and Zho and Zhere they
Zere. While I didn't object to members being psychotic (as long as they
Zere TXiet aboXt it and did not interfere Zith the Zork of others), I did insist
that each member be able to talk, pay attention for eighty minXtes, and
acknoZledge the need for help.

Every prestigioXs clXb has entrance criteria. 3erhaps my reTXirements for
membership made my therapy groXp—the "agenda groXp," as it Zas called
for reasons I shall e[plain later— more desirable. Those ZithoXt the ticket

55
of admission—the more distXrbed, regressed patients? 2ff Zith them to
"commXnication groXp," the other groXp on the Zard, Zhich held shorter,
more strXctXred, less demanding meetings. And, of coXrse, there Zere
alZays those in social e[ile, those Zho Zere too intellectXally impaired,
distracted, belligerent, or manic to be accommodated in any groXp at all.
2ften some agitated patients in social e[ile ZoXld be permitted to attend the
commXnication groXp a day or tZo after medication settled them doZn.

"3ermitted to attend": that phrase ZoXld crack a smile in even the most
ZithdraZn  patient. 1o! /et  me be honest. 1ever in hospital history has
there been a sighting of distXrbed patients poXnding on the doors of the
groXp therapy room demanding admission. A far more familiar scene is the
pre-groXp roXndXp: the posse of attendants and Zhite-cloaked nXrses
galloping throXgh the Zard, roXsting members oXt of their hiding places in
closets, -ohns, and shoZers and herding them into the groXp room.

The agenda groXp had a distinct repXtation: it Zas toXgh and challenging
and, Zorst of all, had no corners—no place to hide. There Zas never any
gate crashing. An Xpper level patient ZoXld not be caXght dead in the
commXnication groXp. 2ccasionally some confXsed loZer fXnctioning
patient ZoXld stXmble into the agenda groXp meeting, bXt once he learned
Zhere he Zas, fear gla]ed his eyes, and no one had to escort him oXt.
AlthoXgh it Zas technically possible to gradXate from the loZer- to the

boXtnern Comfort

level groXp, feZ patients ever stayed in the hospital long enoXgh for that to
happen. ThXs Zas the Zard covertly stratified: everyone kneZ his or her
place. BXt no one ever talked aboXt it.

Before I began to lead groXps in the hospital, I Xsed to think that oXtpatient
groXps Zere challenging. It is not easy to lead a groXp of seven or eight
needy oXtpatients Zith major problems in relating to others; and at the end
of a meeting, I felt tired, often depleted, and marveled at the therapists Zho
had the stamina to go on lead another groXp meeting immediately

56
afterZard. Yet once I began Zorking Zith groXps of hospitali]ed patients, I
looked back Zith mXch nostalgia on those good old oXtpatient groXp
therapy days.

Imagine an oXtpatient groXp—a cohesive meeting of cooperative, highly
motivated patients; a TXiet, co]y room; no nXrses knocking on the door to
yank patients oXt for some lab procedXre or medical appointment; no
sXicidal members Zith bandaged Zrists; no one refXsing to talk; no one
]onked on medication, falling asleep and snoring in the groXp; and, most
important of all, the same patients and the same co-therapist there for each
session, Zeek after Zeek, month after month. What lX[Xry! A therapist's
1irvana. In contrast, the landscape of my inpatient groXps Zas nightmarish
— the continXal rapid tXrnover of members, the freTXent psychotic
oXtbXrsts, the conning, manipXlative members, the patients bXrned oXt by
tZenty years of depression or schi]ophrenia Zho Zere never going to get
better, the tangible levels of despair in the room.

BXt the real killer, the ball-breaker in this Zork, Zas the hospital and
insXrance indXstry bXreaXcracy. Every day, sXrveillance teams of H02
agents ZoXld sZoop throXgh the Zards, nose throXgh hospital charts, and
order the discharge of one or another confXsed, despairing patient Zho had
fXnctioned relatively Zell the previoXs day and Zhose chart had no 0D-
signed note stating e[plicitly that the he or she Zas sXicidal or dangeroXs.

Was there really a time, not so long ago, Zhen the care of the patient Zas
paramoXnt? When physicians admitted the sick and kept them in the
hospital Xntil they got Zell? Was all that only a

D2

dream? I no longer talk mXch aboXt it, no longer risk my stXdents'
patroni]ing smiles by prattling on aboXt that golden era Zhen the
administrator's job Zas to help the doctor help the patient.

The bXreaXcratic parado[es Zere maddening. Consider the case of -ohn,
middle-aged, paranoid, and mildly retarded. Having been once been
physically attacked in a shelter for the homeless, he thereafter avoided
state-sponsored shelters and slept oXtside. -ohn kneZ the magic, hospital-

57
opening Zords and often on cold Zet nights, XsXally aroXnd midnight, he
ZoXld scratch his Zrists in front of an emergency room and threaten deeper
ZoXnds Xnless the state foXnd him a safe, private sleeping space. BXt no
agency had the aXthority to provide tZenty dollars for a room; and since the
emergency room physician coXld not be certain— that is, medically-legally
certain—that -ohn ZoXld not make a serioXs sXicide attempt if he Zere
forced to sleep in the shelter, he spent many nights a year sleeping soXndly
in a five-hXndred-fifty dollar-a-day hospital room, coXrtesy of an inept and
inhXmane medical insXrance system.

The contemporary practice of brief psychiatric hospitali]ation Zorks only if
there is an adeTXate post-hospital oXtpatient program. 1onetheless, in I92,
Governor 5onald 5eagan Zith one bold brilliant stroke, abolished mental
illness in California by not only closing the large state psychiatric hospitals
bXt also eradicating most of the pXblic aftercare programs. As a resXlt the
staff Zere forced, day after day, to go throXgh the charade of treating
patients and discharging them back into the same no[ioXs setting that had
necessitated their hospitali]ation. It Zas like sXtXring Xp ZoXnded soldiers
and sending them back to the fray. Imagine breaking yoXr ass taking care of
patients—initial ZorkXp intervieZ, daily  roXnds, presentation to the
attending psychiatrist, staff planning sessions, medical stXdent ZorkXps,
Zriting  orders in the hospital charts, daily therapy sessions—knoZing all
the Zhile that in a coXple of days there ZoXld be no other option bXt to
retXrn them to the same malignant environment that had disgorged

SoXthern Comfort

them. Back to violent alcoholic families. Back to angry  spoXses Zho had
long ago rXn oXt of love and patience. Back to rag-filled grocery carts. Back
to sleeping in moidering cars. Back to the commXnity of cocaine-cra]ed
friends and pitiless dealers aZaiting them oXtside the hospital gates.

4Xestion: HoZ do Ze healers maintain sanity? AnsZer: /earn to cXltivate
hypocrisy.

So that Zas hoZ I pXt in my time. First, I learned to mXffle my caring—the
very beacon that had led me to this calling. 1e[t, I mastered the canons of
professional sXrvival: Avoid involvement—don't let patients matter too

58
mXch. 5emember they'll be gone tomorroZ. Don't concern yoXrself Zith
their discharge plans. 5emember that small is beaXtifXl—settle for small
goals— don't attempt too mXch—don't set yoXrself Xp for failXre. If, as a
resXlt of being in a therapy groXp, patients learn that talking helps, that
being closer to others feels good, that they may be of Xse to others—that's
plenty.

GradXally, after several frXstrating months of leading groXps Zith neZ
arrivals and discharges every day, I got the hang of it and developed a
method of getting the most oXt of these fragmented groXp meetings. 0y
most radical step Zas to change my time frame.

4Xestion: What is the lifespan of a therapy groXp on a hospital's psychiatric
Zard? AnsZer: one session.

2Xtpatient groXps last for many months, even years; certain problems
reTXire time to emerge, to be identified, and to be altered. In long-term
therapy there is time to "Zork throXgh"—to circle problems and to engage
them again and again (hence, the Zaggish term cyclotherapy). BXt in
hospital therapy groXps, there is no stability, no retXrning to any theme,
becaXse the cast of characters changes so rapidly. In my five years on the
Zard, I rarely had the same complement of members for tZo consecXtive
meetings, never for three! And there Zere many, so many, patients I saZ
only once, Zho attended only a single session and Zere discharged the
folloZing  day. So I became a -ohn StXart 0ill

Xtilitarian groXp therapist and, in my one-session groXps, strove only to
offer the greatest good to the greatest nXmber.

1iet]sche said that Ze need art lest Ze perish from the trXth. 3erhaps
tXrning the hospital therapy groXp into an art form permitted me to remain
committed to a task rendered ineffectXal by forces beyond my control. I
believed that I fashioned ZonderfXl groXp meetings. BeaXtifXl, artistic
meetings. Having by kindergarten discovered that I coXld not sing, dance,
draZ, or play an instrXment, I had resigned myself to never becoming an
artist. BXt I had a change of mind Zhen I began to scXlpt groXp meetings.
3erhaps I had talent after all; perhaps it Zas jXst a matter of finding my
metier. 3atients liked the meetings, the time passed TXickly, Ze e[perienced

59
tender, e[citing moments. I taXght others Zhat I had learned. StXdent
observers Zere impressed. I gave lectXres. I Zrote a book aboXt my
inpatient groXps.

And then, as the years passed, I greZ bored. The sessions felt repetitioXs.
There Zas only so mXch one coXld do in a single session. It Zas like being
permanently sentenced to the first feZ minXtes of a potentially rich
conversation. I yearned for more. I Zanted to go deeper, to matter more in
the lives of my patients.

So, many years ago, I stopped leading inpatient groXps and concentrated on
other forms of therapy. BXt every three months, Zhen neZ residents came
on service, I ZoXld bicycle over from my office in the medical school to the
inpatient Zard for a Zeek at a stretch to teach them to lead inpatient therapy
groXps.

That Zas Zhy I had come today. BXt my heart Zasn't in it. I felt heavy. I
Zas still licking  my ZoXnds. 0y  mother had died jXst three Zeeks before
and her death profoXndly inflXenced Zhat Zas aboXt to transpire in my
therapy groXp meeting.

Entering the groXp room, I looked aroXnd and immediately spotted the
eager, yoXng faces of the three neZ psychiatry residents. As alZays, I felt a
Zave of affection toZard my stXdents and Zanted nothing so mXch as to
give them something—a good demonstration, the type of dedicated
teaching and sXstenance I had been given Zhen I Zas their age. BXt as I
sXrveyed the meet-

8

SoXthern Comfort

ing room my spirits dropped. It Zas not simply that the clXtter of medical
paraphernalia—intravenoXs stands, indZelling catheters, cardiac monitors,
Zheelchairs—reminded me that this particXlar Zard speciali]ed in
psychiatric patients Zho had a severe medical illness and hence Zere likely
to be particXlarly resistant to talking therapy. 1o, it Zas the sight of the
patients themselves.

60
There Zere five in the room sitting in a roZ. The head nXrse had briefly
described their condition to me on the phone. First, there Zas 0artin, an
elderly man in a Zheelchair Zith a severe mXscle-Zasting disease. He Zas
belted into his chair and draped to his Zaist Zith a sheet that permitted only
a small glimpse of his loZer legs—fleshless tZigs covered by dark leathery
skin. 2ne of his forearms Zas heavily bandaged and sXpported by an
e[ternal frame: no doXbt he had slashed his Zrist. (I learned later that his
son, e[haXsted and bitter from having nXrsed him for thirteen years, had
greeted his sXicide attempt Zith, "So yoX botched that, too.")

1e[t  to 0artin  Zas Dorothy, a Zoman Zho had been paraplegic for a year
since trying to end her life by leaping from a third-story ZindoZ. She Zas
in sXch a depressive stXpor that she coXld barely lift her head.

Then there Zere 5osa and Carol, tZo anore[ic yoXng Zomen Zho, both
hooked Xp to I.9s, Zere being fed intravenoXsly becaXse their blood
chemistry Zas Xnbalanced from self-pXrging and their Zeight Zas
dangeroXsly loZ. Carol's appearance Zas particXlarly Xnsettling: she had
e[TXisite, nearly perfect facial featXres bXt almost no covering flesh.
/ooking  at her, I sometimes saZ the face of an astonishingly beaXtifXl
child, at others a grinning skXll.

/astly, there Zas 0agnolia,  an Xnkempt, obese seventy-year-old black
Zoman Zhose legs Zere paraly]ed and Zhose paralysis Zas a medical
mystery. Her thick gold-rimmed spectacles had been mended Zith a small
piece of adhesive tape, and a tiny delicate lace cap Zas pinned to her hair. I
Zas strXck, Zhen she introdXced herself, by the Zay she held my ga]e in
her creamy broZn eyes and by the dignity in her soft SoXthern draZl. "Ahm
very

pleased to meet yoX, Doctah," she said. "Ah heah good things aboXt yoX."
The nXrses had told me that 0agnolia, then sitting TXitely and patiendy in
her Zheelchair, Zas often agitated and tore at imaginary insects craZling on
her skin.

0y  first step Zas to move the members into a circle and to ask the three
residents to sit behind the patients, oXt of their immediate line of vision. I
started the meeting in my XsXal manner by attempting to orient the

61
members to groXp therapy. I introdXced myself, sXggested Ze Xse first
names, and informed them that I ZoXld be there for the ne[t foXr days:
"after that, the tZo residents,"—Zhom I named and pointed oXt—"Zill lead
the groXp. The groXp's pXrpose," I Zent on, "is to help each of yoX learn
more aboXt yoXr relationships Zith others." As I glanced at the hXman
devastation before me— 0artin's Zithered limbs, Carol's death-mask grin,
the intravenoXs bottles feeding 5osa and Carol the vital nXtrients they
refXsed to take by moXth, Dorothy's Xrine bottle holding the Xrine siphoned
from her paraly]ed bladder, 0agnolia's paraly]ed legs—my Zords seemed
pXny and foolish. These people needed so mXch, and "help Zith
relationships" seemed so pitifXlly little. BXt Zhat Zas the point of
pretending that groXps coXld do more than they coXld? 5emember yoXr
mantra, I kept reminding myself: Small is beaXtifXl. Small is beaXtifXl—
small goals, small sXccesses.

I referred to my inpatient groXp as the "agenda groXp" becaXse I alZays
began a meeting by asking each member to formXlate an agenda—to
identify some aspect of themselves that they Zished to change. The groXp
Zorked better if its members' agendas pertained to relationship skills—
especially to something that coXld be Zorked on in the here-and-noZ of the
groXp. 3atients Zho Zere hospitali]ed for major life problems Zere alZays
pX]]led by the focXs on relationships and failed to see the relevance of the
agenda task. I alZays ansZered, "I knoZ that troXbled relationships may not
have been the reason for yoXr hospitali]ation bXt I've foXnd over the years
that everyone Zho has encoXntered significant psychological distress can
profit by

60

SoXthern Comfort

improving their mode of relating to others. The important point is that Ze
can get the most oXt of this meeting by focXsing on relationships becaXse
that's Zhat groXps do best. That's the real strength of groXp therapy."

FormXlating a sXitable agenda Zas difficXlt and, even after attending a feZ
sessions, most groXp members rarely got the hang of it. BXt I told them not
to sZeat it: "0y  job is to help yoX." Still, the process generally consXmed

62
Xp to fifty percent of the meetings. After that, I ZoXld devote the rest of the
time to addressing as many agendas as possible. The demarcation betZeen
formXlating and addressing an agenda is not alZays sharp. For some
patients, forming an agenda Zas the therapy. To learn simply to identify a
problem and to ask for help Zas therapy enoXgh for many in oXr brief time
together.

5osa and Carol, the anore[ic patients, began. Carol claimed that she had no
problems and didn't Zant to improve her relationships. "2n the contrary,"
she said emphatically, "Zhat I Zant is less contact Zith others." 2nly Zhen
I commented that I had never knoZn anyone Zho didn't Zish to change
something aboXt herself did she tentatively offer that she Zas too often
coZed by the anger of others, especially her parents, Zho tried to force her
to eat. Accordingly, she posited, Zith little conviction, an agenda: "I'll try to
be assertive here in the meeting."

5osa , too, had no Zish to improve her relationships; she, too, Zanted to
stay apart. She didn't trXst anyone: "3eople alZays misXnderstand me and
try to change me." "WoXld it be helpfXl," I inTXired, trying to add a here-
and-noZ dimension to the agenda, "for yoX to be Xnderstood in this groXp,
today?" "It might," she said, bXt Zarned me that it Zas hard for her to talk
mXch in groXps: "I"ve alZays felt that others are better, more important than
me."

Dorothy, spittle dripping from her moXth, head deeply boZed to avoid any
eye contact, spoke in a tiny Zhisper and gave me nothing. She said that she
Zas too depressed to participate in the groXp, and that the nXrses had told
her it ZoXld be enoXgh for

her simply to listen. 1othing there to Zork Zith,  I reali]ed, and tXrned to
the other tZo patients.

"I have no hope of anything good ever happening to me again," 0artin said.
His body Zas being relentlessly Zhittled aZay; his Zife, along Zith
everyone else from his past, had died; years had passed since he had last
spoken to a friend; his son Zas sick to death of nXrsing him. "Doctor,
yoX've got better things to do. Don't Zaste yoXr time," he said to me. "/et's
face it—I'm beyond help. 2nce I Zas a good sailor. I coXld do everything

63
on a boat. ShoXld'Xv seen me scamper to the croZ's-nest. 1othing I coXldn't
do there, nothing I didn't knoZ. BXt noZ, Zhat can anyone give me? What
can I give anyone?"

0agnolia  pXt forZard this agenda: "Ah'd like to learn to listen better in this
groXp. Don' yoX think dat ZoXld be a good thing, Doctah? 0ah momma
alZays tol' me it Zas important to be a good listener."

Good God! It Zas going to be a long, long session. HoZ Zas I going to fill
the rest of the time? As I tried to keep my composXre, I coXld feel the edge
of panic seeping in. A fine demonstration for the residents this Zas going to
be! /ook  Zhat I had to Zork Zith:  Dorothy Zas not going to talk at all.
0agnolia  Zanted to learn to listen. 0artin, Zhose life  Zas devoid of
people, felt he had nothing to offer anyone. (I tagged that: a slight chance of
an opening there.) Carol's agenda to be more assertive and not to be coZed
by conflict Zas, I Zas certain, empty; she Zas only going throXgh the
motions of cooperating Zith me. Besides, to encoXrage someone's assertive-
ness, I need an active groXp in Zhich I can Xrge some patients to practice
asking for time or to e[press opinions forthrightly. BXt today there ZoXld be
little against Zhich Carol coXld be assertive. 5osa gave me one tiny ray of
hope—her conviction that she Zas misXnderstood and inferior to others.
0aybe there Zas some handhold there; I tagged it, too.

I made a start on Carol's fear of assertiveness by asking her to e[press some
criticism, hoZever slight, aboXt the Zay I Zas condXcting this meeting so
far. BXt she balked, assXring me that she

62

SoXthern Comfort

thoXght I Zas e[ceptionally sympathetic and skillfXl.

I tXrned to 5osa. There Zas no one else. To my sXggestion that she say
more aboXt others being more important than she, she described hoZ she
had messed Xp everything—"my edXcation, my relationships, every
opportXnity in my life." I tried  to bring her comments into the here-and-noZ
(Zhich alZays increases the poZer of therapy).

64
"/ook  aroXnd the room." I sXggested, "and try to describe hoZ the other
members are more important than yoX."

"I'll  start Zith Carol," she said, Zarming to the task. "She's beaXtifXl. I keep
looking at her. It's like looking at a great painting. And I'm jealoXs of her
bod. She's flat, she's perfectly proportioned Zhile me—look at me, I'm fat
and bloated. /ook at this." HereXpon 5osa pinched her abdomen to shoZ Xs
an eighth-of-an-inch roll of flesh betZeen her thXmb and forefinger.

All this Zas sheer anore[ic madness. 5osa, like many anore[ics, Zas so
cXnning at bXndling herself in layers of clothes that it Zas easy to forget her
emaciation. She Zeighed less than eighty poXnds. And it Zas mad, too, for
her to admire Carol, Zho Zas even thinner. A month ago Zhen I had been
on call and paged becaXse Carol had fainted, I got to the Zard jXst as the
nXrses Zere carrying her back to her bed. Her hospital goZn had opened,
e[posing her bXttocks, throXgh Zhich the head of her femXrs jXtted, all bXt
piercing the skin, reminding me of grXesome photographs of sXrvivors
liberated from concentration camps. BXt there Zas no point in debating
5osa's assessment that she Zas fat. Body-image distortions of anorectic
patients rXn too deep—I had challenged them on that issXe too many times
in too many groXps: that Zas an argXment I kneZ I coXld not Zin.

5osa continXed Zith her comparisons. 0artin and Dorothy Zere dealing
Zith far more significant problems than hers: "Sometimes." she said, "I
Zish I had something visibly Zrong Zith  me, like paralysis. Then I'd feel
more legitimate. That stirred Dorothy into raising her head and making her
first (and, as it happened, only) comment in the groXp. "YoX Zant paraly]ed

legs?" she Zhispered hXskily to 5osa. "Have mine."

To my great astonishment, 0artin rXshed in to defend 5osa: "1o, no,
Dorothy—I got the right name? It is Dorothy, isn't it? 5osa didn't mean it
like that. I knoZ she didn't mean that she Zanted yoXr legs or mine. /ook at
my iegs. /ook at 'em. -Xst look at 'em. Who in their right mind ZoXld Zant
'em?" With his one good hand, 0artin ripped aZay the covering sheet and
pointed to his legs. HideoXsly deformed, they ended in tZo or three gnarled
nXbbins. The rest of his toes had entirely rotted aZay. 1either Dorothy nor

65
any of the other members looked very long at 0artin's legs. They repelled
me, too, despite my medical training.

"5osa Zas jXst Xsing a figXre of speech," 0artin continXed. "She only
meant she Zanted to have a more obvioXs disease, something yoX can see.
She didn't mean to minimi]e oXr condition. Did yoX, 5osa? It is 5osa,
right?"

0artin  sXrprised me. I had alloZed his deformity to conceal his acXte
intelligence. BXt he Zas not finished.

"Do yoX mind if I ask yoX something, 5osa? I don't mean to be nosy, so yoX
don't have to ansZer if yoX don't Zant to."

"Shoot!" 5osa replied. "BXt I may not ansZer it."

"What is yoXr condition? I mean Zhat's Zrong Zith yoX? YoX're real skinny
bXt yoX don't look sick. Why are yoX getting that I.9?" he asked, gestXring
toZard it.

"I don't eat. They feed me Zith this stXff."

"Don't eat? They don't let yoX eat?"

"1o, they Zant me to eat. BXt I don't Zant to." 5Xnning her fingers throXgh
her hair, 5osa seemed to be trying to groom herself.

"Aren't yoX hXngry?" 0artin persisted.

"1o."

I Zas fascinated by this interchange. Since everyone alZays tiptoes aroXnd
eating-disorder patients, I had never before Zitnessed an anore[ic patient
being confronted by a bold ingenXe.

"I'm alZays hXngry," 0artin  said. "YoX shoXld have seen Zhat I had for
breakfast today: aroXnd tZelve pancakes, eggs, tZo

64

orange jXices." He paXsed, hesitated, "Don't eat? Haven't yoX ever had an
appetite?"

"1o. 1ot  as far back as I can remember. I don't like to eat."

"Don't like to eat?"

I coXld see 0artin strXggling to get his mind aroXnd this. He Zas genXinely
baffled—as thoXgh he had jXst met someone Zho didn't enjoy breathing.
"I've alZays eaten a lot. AlZays liked to eat. When my folks took me for a
ride in the car, they alZays had peanXts and potato chips. In fact, that Zas
my nickname."

"What Zas it?" asked 5osa, Zho had slightly tXrned her chair toZard
0artin.

"0r.  Crisp. 0y  mom and dad came from England and called potato chips,
'crisps.' That's Zhat they called me, 0r. Crisp. They liked to go doZn to the
harbor to Zatch the big ships come in. 'Come along, 0r. Crisp,' they'd say,
'let's all go for a ride.' And I'd rXn oXt to oXr car—Ze had the only car on
the block. 2f coXrse, I had good legs then. -Xst like yoX, 5osa." 0artin
leaned forZard in his Zheelchair and peered doZn. "YoX look like yoX got
good legs— a little skinny, thoXgh, no meat on 'em. I Xsed to love to rXn—"

0artin's  voice trailed off. 3X]]lement  fXrroZed his face as he pXlled the
sheet aroXnd him. '"Don't like to eat,'" he repeated as if to himself. "I alZays
liked food. I think yoX missed a lot of fXn."

At this point, 0agnolia,  Zho, trXe to her agenda, had been listening intently
to 0artin,  spoke Xp: "5osa, chile, Ah jXst reminded me of Zhen mah
Darnell Zas small. Sometimes he ZoXldn't eat either. And yoX knoZ Zhat
Ah Xsed to do? Change the scenery! We'd get in the car and drive into
Georgia—Ze lived right near the border. And he'd eat in Georgia. /aZd,
hoZ he ate in Georgia! We Xsed to josh him aboXt his Georgia appetite.
Honey"—here 0agnolia leaned over toZard 5osa and said in a loXd
Zhisper,—"maybe yoX oXght to leave California to eat."

67
Trying to mine something therapeXtic from this discXssion, I stopped the
action (in the jargon, I called for a "process check") and asked the members
to reflect Xpon their oZn interaction.

"5osa, hoZ are yoX feeling aboXt Zhat's happening noZ in the

groXp, aboXt 0artin's and 0agnolia's TXestions?"

"4Xestions are okay—I don't mind them. And I like 0artin—"

"CoXld yoX speak directly to him," I asked.

5osa tXrned to 0artin, "I like  yoX. I don't knoZ Zhy."  And then tXrned back
to face me: "He's been here for a Zeek, bXt today, in this groXp, is the first
time I've spoken to him. It's like Ze have a lot in common bXt I knoZ Ze
don't."

"Do yoX feel Xnderstood?"

"8nderstood? I don't knoZ. Well, yeah, in a fXnny sort of Zay I do. 0aybe
that's it."

"That's Zhat I saZ. I saZ 0artin  trying  his best to Xnderstand yoX. And he
Zasn't trying to do anything else—I didn't hear him try to manage yoX or
tell yoX Zhat to do, or even tell yoX that yoX oXght to eat."

"It's a good thing he didn't try. It ZoXldn't have done any good." Here 5osa
tXrned to Carol, and they e[changed bony grins of complicity. I hated their
grisly conspiracy. I Zanted to shake them so hard their bones rattled. I
Zanted to shoXt, "Stop drinking those diet Cokes! Stay off those goddamn
stationary bikes! This is no joke, yoX tZo are five or si[ poXnds aZay from
death, and Zhen each of yoX is finished dying, yoXr entire life Zill be
described in a three-Zord epitaph: 'I died thin.'"

BXt, of coXrse, I kept this to myself. It ZoXld have done nothing bXt rXptXre
Zhatever slender strands of a relationship I had established Zith them.
Instead, I said to 5osa, "Are yoX aZare that, throXgh yoXr discXssion Zith
0artin,  yoX've already filled part of yoXr agenda today? YoX said yoX

68
Zanted to have the e[perience of being Xnderstood by someone, and 0artin
seems to have done e[actly that."

I then tXrned to 0artin, "HoZ  do yoX feel aboXt that?"

0artin  jXst stared at me. This, I thoXght, may be the liveliest interaction he
has had for years.

"5emember," I reminded him, "yoX started this meeting bv saying yoX
coXld no longer be of Xse to anvone. I heard 5osa say yoX Zere of Xse to
her. YoX hear that, too?"

66

SoXthern Comfort

0artin  nodded. I saZ that his eyes Zere glistening and that he Zas too
moved to speak fXrther. Still, it Zas enoXgh. With only the tiniest of
openings, I had done good Zork Zith 0artin  and 5osa. At least, Ze
ZoXldn't Zalk aZay empty-handed (and I confess I Zas thinking of the
residents as mXch as of the patients).

I tXrned back to 5osa. "HoZ do yoX feel aboXt Zhat 0agnolia is saying to
yoX today? I'm not sXre it's possible to leave California to eat, bXt Zhat I did
see Zas 0agnolia stretching oXt to help yoX."

"Stretch? I'm sXrprised to hear yoX say that," said 5osa. "I don't think of
0agnolia  stretching. Giving is natXral to her, like breathing. She is pXre
soXl. I Zish I coXld take her home Zith me or go home Zith her."

"Honey," 0agnolia  gave 5osa an enormoXs, toothy smile, "yoX don't Zanna
go to mah hoXse. -es' can't fXmigate it. They jes' keep comin' back."
Apparently, 0agnolia Zas talking  aboXt her insect hallXcinations.

"YoX gXys shoXld hire 0agnolia," 5osa said, tXrning to me. "She's the one
Zho really helps me. And not jXst me. Everybody. Even the nXrses come to
0agnolia  Zith their troXbles."

69
"Chile, yoX makin' a lot oXt of nXthin'. YoX ain't got mXch. YoX so skinny
yoX easy to give to. And yoX got a big heart. 0akes folks Zant to give to
yoX. Feels good to help oXt. Thas mah bes' medicine."

"Thas mah bes' medicine, Doctah," 0agnolia repeated, looking over at me.
"YoX jes' let me help oXt folks."

For a feZ moments I coXldn't say a Zord. I felt entranced by 0agnolia—by
those Zise eyes, that inviting smile, that boXnteoXs lap. And those arms—
jXst like my mother's arms, Zith those generoXs folds of flesh cascading
doZn to obscXre her elboZs. What ZoXld it be like to be held, to be cradled,
in those pilloZy chocolate arms? I thoXght of all the pressXres in my life—
Zriting,  teaching, consXlting, patients, Zife, foXr children, financial
commitments, investments, and noZ my mother's death. I need comfort, I
thoXght. 0agnolia-comfort—that's Zhat I need, some of

0agnolia's big-armed comfort. A refrain from  an old -Xdy Collins song
drifted into my mind:

"Too many sad times. . . . Too many bad times.. . . BXt if somehoZ . . . yoX
coXld. . . pack Xp yoXr sorroZs and give them all to me. . . . YoX ZoXld lose
them. ... I knoZ hoZ to Xse them. . . . Give them all to me."

I hadn't thoXght of that song for ever so long. Years before, Zhen I first
heard -Xdy Collins's dXlcet voice sing oXt, "3ack Xp yoXr sorroZs and give
them all to me," desire stirred deep Zithin me. I Zanted to climb right into
the radio to find that Zoman and poXr my sorroZs into her lap.

5osa jolted me oXt of my reverie: "Dr. Yalom, yoX asked earlier Zhy I
thoXght others here Zere better than me. Well, yoX can see noZ Zhat I
mean. YoX see hoZ special 0agnolia is. And 0artin, too. They both care
aboXt others. 3eople—my folks, my sisters—Xsed to tell me I Zas selfish.
They Zere right. I don't reach oXt to do anything for anyone. I don't have
anything to offer. All I really  Zant is for people to leave me alone."

0agnolia  leaned toZard me. "That child is so artfXl," she said.

"ArtfXl"—a  strange Zord. I Zaited to see Zhat she meant.

70
"YoX shoXld see the blanket she's embroidering for me in occXpational
therapy. TZo roses in the center, and aroXnd them she's stitching teeny
violets, mXs' be tZenty of 'em, all along the edges. And she did the edges in
a delicate red design. Honey," 0agnolia tXrned to 5osa, "Zill yoX bring that
blanket into groXp tomorroZ? And the pictXre yoX Zas draZin', too?"

5osa blXshed, bXt nodded assent.

Time Zas passing. I sXddenly reali]ed I hadn't e[plored Zhat the groXp
coXld offer 0agnolia. I  had been too enchanted by the promise of her
largesse and the memory of that refrain, "YoX ZoXld lose them, I knoZ hoZ
to Xse them."

"YoX knoZ, 0agnolia,  yoX shoXld get something from the groXp, too. YoX
started the meeting by saving that Zhat yoX Zant from the groXp is to be a
good listener. BXt I'm impressed, very impressed, Zith Zhat a good listener
yoX already are. And a good

68

SoXthern Comfort

observer, too: look at the details yoX remember aboXt 5osa's napkins. So I
don't think yoX need a lot of help Zith learning to listen. HoZ else can Ze
help yoX in this groXp?"

"Ah don' knoZ hoZ  dis groXp can help me."

"I heard a lot of good things said aboXt yoX today HoZ does that feel?"

"Well, natchally, dat feels good."

"BXt, 0agnolia,  I have a hXnch yoX've heard that before—that people have
alZays loved yoX for hoZ mXch yoX give. Why, the nXrses Zere saying that
very thing before the groXp met today— that yoX've raised a son and fifteen
foster children and never stop giving."

"1ot  noZ. Ah can't give nXthin' noZ. Ah can't move mah legs, and those
bXgs—" She shXddered sXddenly, bXt her soft smile remained. "Ah don't

71
Zant to go back home no more."

"What I mean, 0agnolia, is that it probably isn't too helpfXl for others to
tell yoX things aboXt yoXrself that yoX already knoZ. If Ze're going to help
yoX here, Ze need to give yoX something else. 0aybe Ze've got to help yoX
learn neZ things aboXt yoXrself, give yoX some feedback aboXt yoXr blind
spots, things yoX may not have knoZn."

"Ah done tole' yoX, Ah gets help by helpin' other folks."

"I knoZ  that, and that's one of the things I really like aboXt yoX. BXt, yoX
knoZ, it feels good to everyone to be helpfXl to others. /ike 0artin—look
Zhat it meant to him to help 5osa by being Xnderstanding."

"Dat 0artin  is sometin. He don' move too good, bXt he's got a fine head on
his shoXlders, a real fine head."

"YoX do help others and yoX're good at it. YoX're a marvel, and I agree Zith
5osa, the hospital shoXld hire yoX. BXt, 0agnolia," I hesitated in order to
give my Zords greater impact, "it ZoXld be good for others to be able to
help yoX, too. By being so totally giving, yoX don't let others get help from
helping yoX. When 5osa said she'd like to go home Zith yoX, I Zas
thinking, too, hoZ great it ZoXld be to be comforted by yoX all the time. I'd
like that, too. I'd

love it. BXt, then, Zhen I thoXght more aboXt it, I reali]ed I'd never be able
to repay yoXr help, to help yoX, becaXse yoX never complain, yoX never ask
for anything. In fact," I hesitated again, "I'd never get to have the pleasXre
of offering yoX something."

"Ah nevah thoXght aboXt it jes' like that." 0agnolia nodded her head
thoXghtfXlly. Her smile had vanished.

"BXt it's trXe, isn't it? 0aybe Zhat Ze oXght to do here in this groXp is help
yoX learn to complain. 0aybe yoX need the e[perience of being listened to.
"

"0ah  momma alZays said I pXt myself iast."

72
"I don't alZays agree Zith mothers. In fact, I don't XsXally agree Zith them,
bXt in this case I think yoXr mother Zas right. So Zhy not practice
complaining? Tell Xs, Zhat hXrts? What do yoX Zant to change aboXt
yoXrself?"

"0ah  health ain't so good . . . These things craZlin aroXnd on mah skin.
And these legs heah ain't good. Ah can't move 'em."

"That's a start, 0agnolia. And I knoZ  those are the real problems in yoXr
life noZ. I Zish  Ze coXld do something aboXt those problems here in this
groXp, bXt groXps can't do that. Try to complain aboXt things Ze might be
able to help yoX Zith."

"Ah feel bad aboXt mah hoXse. It's nasty. Dey can't, maybe dey Zon't
fXmigate it right. Ah don' Zant to go back there."

"I knoZ  yoX feel bad aboXt yoXr hoXse and yoXr legs and yoXr skin. BXt
those things aren't yoX. They are jXst things aboXt yoX, not the real, the core
yoX. /ook at the center of yoX. What do yoX Zant to change there?"

"Well, Ah ain't real satisfied Zith mah life. I  got mah regrets. Dat Zhat yoX
mean, Doctah?"

"5ight  on." I nodded vigoroXsly.

She continXed: "Ah've disappointed myself. Ah alZays Zanted to be a
teachXh. Dat Zas mah dream. BXt Ah never did be one. Sometimes Ah gets
doZn, and Ah think Ah never did nXthin'."

"BXt, 0agnolia,"  5osa implored, "look Zhat  yoX've done for Darnell or for
all those foster kids. YoX call that nothing?"

"Sometime it feel like nXthin'. Darnell ain' gonna do nXthin'

0

Zith his life,  ain' going noZhere. He jes' like his father."

73
5osa broke in. She seemed alarmed—her pXpils Zere enormoXs. She spoke
to me as thoXgh I Zere a jXdge and she a laZyer pleading 0agnolia's case.
"She never had a chance for an edXcation, Dr. Yalom. When she Zas a
teenager, her father died and her mother jXst disappeared for fifteen years."

"SXddenly Carol pitched in, also addressing me: "She had to raise her seven
brothers and sisters almost alone."

"1ot  alone. Ah had help—from the pastor, the chXrch, lots of good folk."

Ignoring 0agnolia's  disclaimer, 5osa addressed me. "I met 0agnolia Zhen
Ze Zere both in the hospital aboXt a year ago and once, after Ze Zere
discharged, I picked her Xp in my car and Ze rode aroXnd all afternoon—
throXgh 3alo Alto, Stanford, 0enlo 3ark, Xp into the hills. 0agnolia  gave
me a toXr. She pointed oXt everything to me, not jXst the important stXff
noZ, bXt also the Zay this Zhole coXnty Xsed to be, and all the things that
happened thirty or forty years ago on some special spot. That Zas the best
ride I ever had."

"HoZ do yoX feel aboXt Zhat 5osa said, 0agnolia?"

0agnolia  softened again. "Das good, das good. Dat chile knoZs I loves
her."

"So, 0agnolia,"  I said, "it looks like, despite everything, despite all the
odds stacked against yoX, yoX became a teacher after all! And a good
teacher."

1oZ  things Zere click—click—clicking   in the groXp. I glanced proXdly
toZard the psychiatry residents. 0y last comment—a beaXtifXl e[ample of
refraining—Zas a gem. I hoped they heard it.

0agnolia  heard it. She seemed deeply moved and Zept for several minXtes.
We honored the moment by sitting in respectfXl silence. 0agnolia's ne[t
comment took me aback. 2bvioXsly I had not listened Zell to her.

"YoX right, Doctah. YoX right." Then she added, "YoX right, bXt yoX ain't
right. Ah had a dream. Ah Zanted to be a real teachXh, to get paid Zhite

74
teachXh's pay, to have real stXdents, to have them call

me '0rs. -ohnson.' Das Zhat Ah mean."

"BXt, 0agnolia,"  5osa persisted, "look at Zhat yoX did do— think of
Darnell and those fifteen foster kids Zho call yoX 0omma."

"Dat got nXthin' to do Zith Zhat Ah Zanted, Zith  mah dreams," said
0agnolia,  her voice sharp and forcefXl.. "Ah had dreams, too, like Zhite
folk. Black folk  have dreams, too! And Ah Zas very disappointed Zith mah
marriage. Ah Zanted a Zhole-life marriage, an all Ah got Zas a foXrteen-
month marriage. Ah Zas a fool, Ah picked the Zrong man. He liked his gin
—lot more'n he liked me.

"God is my Zitness," she continXed, tXrning to me, "Ah nevah before—till
this meetin' today—bad-moXthed mah hXsband. Ah don' Zant my Darnell
to evah hear anythin' bad aboXt his daddy. BXt, Doctah, yoX right. YoX right.
Ah got complaints. A lot of things Ah Zanted Ah nevah got. 1evah got my
dream. Sometimes Ah can feel real bitter."

Tears Zere streaming doZn her cheeks as she sobbed softly. Then she
tXrned aZay from the groXp, stared oXt the ZindoZ, and began scratching
her skin, at first softly and then Zith deep long digs. "5eal bitter. 5eal
bitter." she repeated.

I felt disoriented. /ike  5osa, I greZ alarmed. I Zanted the old 0agnolia
back. And her claZing Xnnerved me. Was she trying to scrape aZay the
insects? 2r her blackness? I Zanted to grab her Zrists and still her hands
before she lacerated her flesh.

A long paXse and then: "And they is other things Ah coXld say, too, bXt they
is very personal."

I kneZ that 0agnolia  Zas primed. I had no doXbt that, Zith the slightest
prod, she ZoXld tell Xs everything. BXt she had gone far enoXgh for the rest
of Xs. Too far. 5osa's distraXght eyes Zere telling me, "3lease, please, no
more! Stop this!" And it Zas enoXgh for me too. I had taken the lid off bXt,
for once, I did not Zant to look inside.

75
After tZo  or three minXtes, 0agnolia stopped Zeeping, stopped scratching.
SloZly her smile reappeared, and her voice became soft again. "BXt then
Ah figXre that the good /aZd has His reasons for giving Xs each a bXrden.
WoXldn't it be pridefXl fo' me to try figXre

2

SoXthern Comfort

oXt His reasons?"

The groXp members Zere silent. Apparently embarrassed they all—even
Dorothy—looked aZay, oXt the ZindoZ. This is, I kept trying to tell myself,
good therapy: 0agnolia has faced some of her demons and noZ seems
poised on the brink of some important therapeXtic Zork.

Yet I felt I had desecrated her. 3erhaps the other members felt that Zay, too.
Yet they said nothing. A heavy silence descended. I caXght each member's
ga]e and silently Xrged each to speak. 3erhaps I had read into 0agnolia too
mXch Earth 0other. 3erhaps it Zas only I Zho had lost an icon. I strXggled
to pXt my sense of desecration into Zords that ZoXld be XsefXl to the groXp.
1othing came. 0y  mind Zas silent. Giving Xp, I glXmly resigned myself to
a tired, scXffed comment I had Xttered coXntless times before in coXndess
groXp meetings: "0agnolia has said a great deal. What feelings do her
Zords stir Xp in each of yoX?"

I hated saying that, hated its ordinariness, its technical banality. Ashamed of
myself, I slXmped into my chair. I kneZ precisely hoZ the groXp members
ZoXld respond, and grimly aZaited their formXlaic comments:

"I feel I really knoZ  yoX noZ, 0agnolia."

"I feel a lot closer to yoX noZ."

"I see yoX as a real person noZ."

Even one of the residents, ventXring oXt of his role as silent observer,
chipped in, "0e,  too, 0agnolia. I  see yoX as a fXll person, someone I can

76
relate to. I e[perience yoX in three dimensions noZ."

2Xr time Zas Xp. I had to sXmmari]e the session somehoZ, and delivered
the obvioXs, mandator}  interpretation: "YoX knoZ, 0agnolia, this has
been a toXgh meeting bXt a rich one. What I'm aZare of is that Ze started
Zith the issXe of yoXr not being able to complain, perhaps not feeling yoX
had the right to complain. YoXr Zork today has been Xncomfortable, bXt it's
the beginning of real progress. The point is that yoX have a lot of pain
inside, and if yoX can learn to complain aboXt it and deal Zith it direcdy

77
as yoX've done today, yoX Zon't have to e[press it in indirect Zays—for
e[ample, throXgh problems Zith yoXr hoXse, or yoXr legs, perhaps even the
feelings aboXt insects on yoXr skin."

0agnolia  didn't ansZer. She jXst looked straight at me, her eyes still
brimming Zith  tears.

"Do yoX Xnderstand Zhat I mean, 0agnolia?"

"Ah Xnderstan', Doctah. Ah Xnderstan' real good." She Ziped her eyes Zith
a tiny handkerchief. "Ah'm sorry to be baZlin' so mXch. Ah didn't tell yoX
before, maybe Ah shoXld've, bXt tomor-rah's the day mah momma died.
2ne yeah ago tomorrah."

"I knoZ  Zhat that feels like, 0agnolia,  I lost my mother last month."

I sXrprised myself. 2rdinarily I ZoXldn't  speak so personally to a patient I
barely kneZ. I think I Zas trying to give her something. BXt 0agnolia didn't
acknoZledge my gift. The groXp began to disperse. The doors opened.
1Xrses entered to help the patients oXt. I Zatched 0agnolia scratching
aZay at herself as she Zas Zheeled oXt.

In the discXssion folloZing the groXp meeting, I enjoyed the harvest of my
labors. The residents Zere fXll of praise. Above all, they Zere properly
impressed by the spectacle of something emerging from Zhat looked like
nothing. Despite scant material and little patient motivation, the groXp had
generated considerable interaction: by the meeting's end, members, Zho for
the most part had been oblivioXs of the e[istence of other patients on the
Zard, Zere noZ engaged and concerned Zith one another. The residents
Zere also impressed by the poZer of my closing interpretation to 0agnolia:
that if she Zere to reTXest help e[plicitly, she ZoXld render obsolete her
symptoms, Zhich Zere symbolic, obliTXe cries for help.

HoZ did yoX do it? they marveled. At the beginning of the meeting
0agnolia  seemed impenetrable. It Zasn't difficXlt, I told them. If yoX find
the right key, it's alZays possible to open a door to the other's sXffering. For

78
0agnolia  that kev had been the appeal to one of her deepest valXes—her
Zish to be of service to

4

SoXthern Comfort

others. By persXading her that she coXld help others by alloZing them to be
helpfXl to her, I had TXickly Xndermined her resistance.

As Ze spoke Sarah, the head nXrse, poked her head in the door to thank me
for coming. "YoX've Zorked yoXr magic again, Irv. Wanna get yoXr heart
Zarmed? Before yoX leave, take a peek at the patients having lXnch, at all
those heads closer together. And Zhat did yoX do to Dorothy? Can yoX
believe she and 0artin and 5osa are talking together?"

Sarah's Zords rang in my ears as I biked back to my office. I kneZ I had
every reason to be satisfied Zith my morning's Zork. The residents Zere
right: it had been a good meeting—a fantastic one, becaXse it not only
encoXraged members to improve relationships in their lives bXt, as Sarah's
report sXggested, also engaged them more fXlly in all aspects of the Zard's
therapy program.

0ost  of all, I had shoZn them that there is no sXch thing as a boring or
empty patient—or groXp. Within every patient, and Zithin every clinical
sitXation lies the chrysalis of a rich hXman drama. The art of psychotherapy
lies in activating that drama.

BXt Zhy did my good Zork give me sXch little personal satisfaction? I felt
gXilty—as thoXgh I had done something fraXdXlent. The praise I so often
pXrsXed didn't sit Zell Zith me that day The stXdents (coverdy egged on by
me) had imbXed me Zith great Zisdom. In their eyes, I offered "poZerfXl"
interpretations, Zorked my "magic," led the groXp in a prescient, sXre-
handed manner. BXt I kneZ the trXth: that throXghoXt the meeting I had
scrambled and improvised Zildly. Both stXdents and patients vieZed me as
something I Zas not, as more than I Zas, more than I coXld be. It occXrred
to me that in that respect 0agnolia, the archetypal earth mother, and I had
mXch in common.

79
I reminded myself that small is beaXtifXl. 0y job Zas to lead a single groXp
meeting and make it helpfXl to as many of its groXp members as possible.
And hadn't I done that? I revieZed the groXp from the perspective of each
of the five members.

0artin  and 5osa? Yes, good Zork. I Zas certain of them. Their agendas for
the meeting had, to some degree, been filled: 0artin's demorali]ation, his
conviction that he had nothing of valXe to offer, had been effectively
challenged; 5osa's belief that any person Xnlike herself—that is, any non-
anore[ic—ZoXld misXnderstand and attempt to manipXlate her Zas refXted.

Dorothy and Carol? ThoXgh inactive, they had nonetheless appeared
engaged. 3erhaps they had benefited from spectator therapy: Zatching
someone else Zork effectively in therapy often primes a patient for good
therapeXtic Zork in the fXtXre.

And 0agnolia?  Therein lay the problem. Had I helped 0agnolia? Was she
help-able? In the head nXrse's briefing I had learned that she had not
responded to a Zide array of psychotropic medication, and that everyone,
inclXding her case Zorker of several years, had long ago given Xp trying to
engage her in any insight-oriented psychotherapy. So Zhy had I decided to
try once more?

Had I been helped her? I doXbted it. AlthoXgh the residents considered my
final interpretation "poZerfXl," and, indeed, my Zords had felt so as I said
them, in my heart, I kneZ that it Zas all a sham: my interpretation had no
real chance of being XsefXl to 0agnolia. Her symptoms—the ine[plicable
paralysis of her legs, the hallXcinations of insects on her skin, her delXsion
that a conspiracy Zas behind the insect infestation of her home—Zere
grave and far beyond the reach of psychotherapy. Even Xnder the most
favorable circXmstances—Xnlimited time Zith a skilled therapist—
psychotherapy ZoXld probably offer 0agnolia little. And  there Zere ]ero
favorable possibilities here: 0agnolia had no money, no insXrance, and
ZoXld XndoXbtedly be discharged to some bare-bones nXrsing facility
ZithoXt a prayer of obtaining folloZ-Xp psychotherapy. 0y rationale that
my interpretation ZoXld prime 0agnolia  for fXtXre Zork Zas pXre illXsion.

80
Given these conditions, hoZ "poZerfXl," then, Zas my interpretation?
3oZerfXl to do Zhat? The poZer Zas a phantom; in fact, I had engaged in
persXasive rhetoric directed not at the forces that shackled 0agnolia bXt at
my stXdent aXdience. She

6

boXtnern Comfort

had been a victim to my vanity.

I Zas closer to the trXth noZ. And yet my disTXiet persisted. I tXrned to the
TXestion of Zhy my jXdgment had been so poor. I had broken a fXndamental
rXle of psychotherapy: do not strip aZay a patient's defenses if yoX have
nothing better to offer in their stead. And Zhat Zas the force behind my
actions? Why had 0agnolia assXmed sXch importance to me?

The ansZer to this TXestion lay, I sXspected, in my response to my mother's
death. I revieZed again the coXrse of the meeting. When had things started
to affect me so personally? It Zas that first sight of 0agnolia: that smile,
those cXshiony forearms. 0y mother's arms. HoZ they dreZ me! HoZ I
Zished to be encircled and comforted by those soft doXghy arms. And that
song, that -Xdy Collins song—hoZ did it go? I searched for the Zords.

BXt instead of the song lyrics, the events of a long-forgotten afternoon
drifted into my mind. 2n  SatXrday afternoons Zhen I Zas aboXt eight or
nine and living in Washington, D.C., my friend 5oger and I often bicycled
to picnic in a park called the 2ld Soldiers' Home. 2ne day, instead of
roasting hot dogs, Ze conspired to steal a live chicken from a hoXse
bordering the park and cook it over a campfire Ze bXilt in a sXnny clearing
in the park forest.

BXt first, the killing—my  initiation into the rites of death. 5oger took the
initiative and bashed the sacrificial chicken Zith an enormoXs rock. ThoXgh
bloodied and crXshed, it continXed to fight for life. I Zas horrified. I tXrned
aZay, Xnable to bear Zatching the Zretched creatXre. Things had gone too
far. I Zanted to Xndo them. Then and there I lost interest in my project of
appearing groZn-Xp. I Zanted my mother, I Zanted to cycle home so that

81
she coXld hold me. I Zanted to reverse time, erase everything, start the day
over. BXt there Zas no tXrning back and nothing to do bXt to Zatch 5oger
grab the chicken by its battered head and Zhirl it aroXnd like a bolo knife
Xntil, finally, it Zas still.  We mXst have plXcked it, cleaned it, pXt it on a
spit. We mXst have roasted it over the fire and eaten it. 3erhaps Zith gXsto.
BXt,

thoXgh there's an eerie clarity to my memory of trying to Zish aZay the
Zhole catastrophe—of all Ze actXally did I remember nothing.

Still, the memory of that afternoon gripped me, Xntil I freed myself by
asking Zhy it had emerged noZ after so many decades in deep storage?
What links the Zheelchair-filled hospital groXp room Zith the events played
oXt so long ago aroXnd the campfire in a copse of the Soldier's Home?
3erhaps the idea of going too far—as I had gone too far Zith 0agnolia.
3erhaps some visceral apprehension of the irreversibility of time. 3erhaps
the aching, the longing, for a mother to protect me from the brXte facts of
life and death.

ThoXgh the aftertaste of the groXp meeting Zas still bitter, I felt closer to its
soXrce: XndoXbtedly my deep craving for motherly comfort, fanned by my
mother's death, had articXlated mightily Zith 0agnolia's earth mother
image. Had I had stripped aZay that image, secXlari]ed her, obliterated her
poZer, in an effort to face doZn my yearning for comfort? That song, that
earth mother song, bits of the lyrics noZ began to retXrn: "3ack Xp yoXr
sorroZs and give them all to me. I coXld Xse them, yoX ZoXld lose them..."
Silly, pXerile Zords. I coXld remember only faindy the snXg, boXntifXl,
Zarm place into Zhich they once led me. 1oZ those Zords no longer
Zorked. 0Xch  as I blink my eyes at a 9asarely or an Escher illXsion to
reinstate the alternate image, I tried to flip my mind back to that place—bXt
in vain.

CoXld I do ZithoXt that illXsion? All my life  I had soXght comfort in a
variety of earth mothers. I paraded them noZ before me: my dying mother,
from Zhom I Zanted something—I don't knoZ  Zhat—even as she gasped
her last breaths; the many loving black hoXsekeepers, their names long
vanished from memory, Zho held me as infant and child; my sister, herself
badly loved, offering me scraps from her dish; the harried teachers Zho

82
singled me oXt for praise; my old analyst Zho sat loyally—and silendv—
Zith me for three years.

1oZ  I Xnderstood more clearly hoZ all these personal feel-

8

boXtkern Comfort

ings—let Xs call them "coXntertransference"—made it almost impossible
for me to offer Xnconflicted therapeXtic help to 0agnolia. If I had jXst let
her be, jXst basked in her Zarmth as 5osa had done, jXst settled for small
goals, then I ZoXld have condemned myself for Xsing my patient for my
oZn comfort. As it Zas, I  had challenged her defensive strXctXre and noZ
condemned myself for grandiosity and for sacrificing her for the sake of a
teaching demonstration. What I coXld not, or did not, do Zas to bracket all
my feelings and to have a real encoXnter Zith 0agnolia—0agnolia, the
flesh and blood person, not the image I had imposed Xpon her.

The day folloZing the groXp meeting, 0agnolia Zas discharged from the
hospital, and I chanced to see her Zaiting in the hospital corridor by the
ZindoZ  of the oXtpatient pharmacy. Aside from her tiny delicate lace cap
and the blXe embroidered blanket (5osa's gift) covering her legs in the
Zheelchair, she looked ordinary—Zeary, shabby, indistingXishable from the
long gray line of sXpplicants stretching before and behind her. I nodded to
her, bXt she didn't see me, and I continXed on my Zay. A feZ minXtes later,
I reconsidered and tXrned back to find her. Still at the ZindoZ, she Zas
placing her discharge medications into a Zorn petit-point bag on her lap. I
Zatched her Zheel aZay toZard the hospital e[it, Zhere she stopped,
opened her pXrse, took oXt a small handkerchief, removed her thick, gold-
rimmed eyeglasses, and daintily Ziped aZay the tears coXrsing doZn her
cheeks. I Zent over to her. "0agnolia, hello. 5emember me?"

"YoXr voice soXnd real familiar," she said, replacing her spectacles. "1oZ
yoX jes' Zait a minXte Zhile Ah get a look at yoX." She stared at me,
blinking tZo  or three times, and then broke into a Zarm smile. "Doctah
Yalom, Ah sXre do remembah yoX. 1ice of yoX to stop and visit. I bin
Zanting to talk to yoX, private-like." She pointed to a chair at the end of the

83
corridor. "Ah see a seat for yoX over there. Ah carry mah oZn aroXnd Zith
me. WoXld yoX Zheel me over?"

When Ze had moved, and I had sat doZn, 0agnolia said, "YoX jes gonna
have to oversight mah tears. Ah can' stop baZling

today."

Trying hXsh my moXnting fear that the groXp session had indeed been
destrXctive, I said, gently, "0agnolia, do yoXr tears have anything to do
Zith oXr groXp meeting yesterday?"

"The groXp?" She looked at me incredXloXsly. "Doctah Yalom, yoX ain't
forgotten Zhat Ah tol' yoX at the end of that meetin'? Today's the day mah
momma died—one yeah ago today."

"2h, of  coXrse. Sorry, I'm a little sloZ at the moment. GXess too mXch is
going on in my oZn life, 0agnolia."   5elieved, I doZnshifted TXickly into
my professional gear. "YoX miss her a lot, don't yoX?"

"Ah do. And yoX remembah 5osa tole yoX mah momma Zas gone Zhen Ah
Zas groZin' Xp—she jes shoZed Xp one day after being aZay for fifteen
years."

"BXt then, Zhen she came back, she took care of yoX? Gave yoX a lot of
momma comfort?"

"A momma's a momma. Ain't got bXt one of 'em. BXt, yoX knoZ, 0omma
didn't take care of me mXch—other Zay aroXnd— she Zas ninety Zhen she
passed aZay. 1o, it Zeren't that at all—it Zas more jes' that she Zas there.
Ah don' knoZ . . . gXess she stood for somethin' Ah needed. YoX knoZ Zhat
Ah mean?"

"I knoZ  e[actly Zhat  yoX mean, 0agnolia. I do, indeed."

"0aybe  it ain't mah place to say, Doctah, bXt Ah think yoX're like me—yoX
miss yoXr momma, too. Doctahs need mommas, too, jes like mommas need
mommas."

84
"YoX're right aboXt that, 0agnolia. YoX've got a good si[th sense—like
5osa said. BXt, yoX said yoX Zere Zanting to talk to me?"

"Well, like I already said—aboXt yoX missing yoXr momma. Dat Zas one
thing. And then aboXt dat groXp meetin'. Ah jes' Zanted to thank yoX—das
all. I got a lot from that meetin'."

"Can yoX tell me Zhat yoX got from it?"

"Ah learned something Xrgent. Ah learned that Ah'm done Zith rearin'
children. Ah'm done Zith that—fo'ever . . ." Her voice trailing off  and she
looked aZay, peered doZn the corridor.

80

SoXthern Comfort

8rgent? Forever?—0agnolia's Xne[pected Zords intrigXed me. I Zanted to
keep on talking to her all afternoon, and Zas disappointed to hear her say,
"2h look  theh, it's ClaXdia, comin' for me."

ClaXdia Zheeled 0agnolia oXt the front door to the van that Zas to take her
to the nXrsing home to Zhich she Zas being discharged. I folloZed her oXt
to the cXrb and Zatched her and her chair being hoisted inside by the lift on
the back of the van.

"Good-bye Doctah Yalom," she said, Zaving to me. "Take care of yoX'self."

Strange, I mXsed, as I Zatched the van drive aZay, that I, Zho have devoted
my life to apprehending the Zorld of the other, have not, Xntil 0agnolia,
trXly Xnderstood that those Zhom Ze transform into myth are themselves
myth-ridden. They despair; they moXrn the death of a mother; they search
for the e[alted; they, too, rage against life and may need to maim
themselves to be done Zith giving.

ong ago Earl, my friend of many years, phoned to tell me that his closest
friend, -ack, had jXst been diagnosed Zith a malignant, inoperable brain
tXmor. Before I coXld commiserate, he said, "/ook, Irv, I'm not calling for
me—bXt for someone else. A favor—something really important to me.
/ook,  Zill  yoX treat -ack's Zife, Irene? -ack's going to die a Xgly death—
perhaps the hardest death life can deal. It doesn't help matters that she's a
sXrgeon: she'll knoZ too mXch and it'll be agoni]ing for her to stand and
Zatch helplessly as his cancer eats aZay his brain. And then she'll be left
Zith a yoXng daXghter, a fXll practice, and heavy teaching responsibilities.
Her fXtXre's a nightmare."

As I listened to Earl's reTXest, I Zanted to help. I Zanted to give everything
he asked. BXt there Zere problems. Good therapy reTXires crisp boXndaries,
and I kneZ both -ack and Irene. 1ot Zell, it's trXe, bXt Ze'd been at a coXple
of dinner parties together at Earl's home. I had also once Zatched a sXper
boZl game Zith -ack and played tennis Zith him a feZ times.

All of  this I told Earl and ZoXnd Xp, "Treating someone yoX knoZ socially
never fails to get messy- The best Zay for me to help is to find the best
referral—someone Zho doesn't knoZ the family."

"I kneZ yoX'd say that," he replied. "I prepared Irene for that ansZer. I've
been over it Zith her again and again, bXt she Zon't see anyone else. She's
pretty strong-Zilled and thoXgh, in general, she has little respect for the
field of psychiatry, she's got a fi[ on yoX. She says she's folloZed yoXr
Zork and is convinced, God knoZs Zhy, yoX're the only psychiatrist smart
enoXgh for her."

"/et  me sleep on it. I'll call yoX back tomorroZ."

What to do? 2n the one hand, friendship called: Earl and I had never
refXsed one another anything. BXt, the potential boXndary leakage made me
TXeasy. Earl and his Zife, Emily, Zere tZo of my closest confidants. And
she, in tXrn, Zas Irene's closest friend. I coXld imagine the tZo of them in a
tete-a-tete talking aboXt me. Yes, no TXestion: I heard alarm signals ringing.
BXt I tXrned the volXme knob Zay doZn. I ZoXld e[tract a pledge from

86
both Irene and Emily to bXild a Zall of silence aroXnd therapy. Trick}  and
comple[. BXt, if I  Zere as smart as she thoXght I Zas, I coXld handle it.

After I hXng Xp, I Zondered Zhy I Zas so Zilling  to ignore the alarm
signals. I reali]ed that Earl's reTXest at this particXlar jXnctXre of my life
seemed fatefXl. A colleagXe and I had jXst finished three years of empirical
research on spoXsal bereavement, stXdying eighty men and Zomen Zho had
recently become ZidoZs and ZidoZers. I had intervieZed each at length
and treated all of them in brief eight-person therapy groXps. 2Xr research
team folloZed their progress for a year, collected a moXntain of
information, and pXblished several papers in professional joXrnals. I had
become persXaded that feZ people kneZ more than I aboXt the sXbject. As

84

a bereavement hot shot, hoZ coXld I, in good conscience, Zithhold myself
from Irene?

Besides, she had said the magic Zords—that I Zas the only one smart
enoXgh to treat her. The perfect plXg for my socket of vanity.

/esson 1. The First Dream

A feZ days later I met Zith Irene for oXr first session. /et me say right off
the bat that she tXrned oXt to be one of the most interesting, intelligent,
stXbborn, agoni]ed, sensitive, imperioXs, elegant, hard-Zorking, ingenioXs,
Xnbending, coXrageoXs, attractive, proXd, frosty, romantic, and infXriating
Zomen I have ever knoZn.

0idZay   throXgh the first session, she described a dream she'd had the
previoXs night:

"I'm still  a sXrgeon, bXt I'm also a grad stXdent in English. 0y preparation
for a coXrse involves tZo different te[ts, an ancient and a modern te[t, each
Zith the same name. I am Xnprepared for the seminar becaXse I haven't read

87
either te[t. I especially haven't read the old, first te[t Zhich ZoXld have
prepared me for the second."

"What else do yoX remember, Irene? I asked Zhen she stopped. "YoX say
each te[t had the same name. Do yoX knoZ Zhat it Zas?"

"2h yes, I remember it clearly. Each book, the old and the neZ, Zas entitled
The Death of Innocence."

/istening  to Irene I lapsed into reverie. This dream of hers Zas pXre gold,
intellectXal ambrosia—a gift from the gods. The psychological gXmshoe's
daydream come trXe. The reZard for patience, the payoff for coXntless
tedioXs therapy stakeoXts Zith inhibited engineers.

It Zas a dream to make even the most irritable, the most grXmpy therapist
pXrr Zith pleasXre. And pXrr I did. TZo te[ts—an ancient

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

and a neZ one. 3Xrr, pXrr. The ancient te[t needed to Xnderstand the neZ.
3Xrr. 3Xrr. And the title, The Death of Innocence. 3Xrr, pXrr, pXrr.

It Zasn't only that Irene's dream promised an intellectXal treasXre hXnt of
the highest order; it Zas also a first dream. Ever since loll, Zhen FreXd first
discXssed it, a mystiTXe has sXrroXnded the initial dream a patient reports in
psychoanalysis. FreXd believed that this first dream is Xnsophisticated and
highly revealing becaXse beginning patients are naive and still have their
gXard doZn. /ater in therapy, Zhen it is evident that the therapist has highly
skilled dream interpretative abilities, the dreamZeaver residing in oXr
XnconscioXs groZs caXtioXs, goes on fXll alert, and takes care thereafter to
manXfactXre more comple[ and obfXscating dreams.

FolloZing  FreXd, I often imagined the dreamZeaver as a plXmp, jovial
homXncXlXs, living the good life amidst a forest of dendrites and a[ons. He
sleeps by day, bXt at night, reclining on a cXshion of bX]]ing synapses, he
drinks honeyed nectar and la]ily spins oXt dream seTXences for his host. 2n
the night before the first therapy visit that host falls asleep fXll of
conflicting thoXghts aboXt the Xpcoming therapy; and as XsXal, the

88
homXncXlXs goes aboXt his nighttime job blithely Zeaving those fears and
hopes into a simple, transparent dream. Then, Zith great alarm, the
homXncXlXs learns that the therapist has deftly interpreted his dream. The
homXncXlXs gracioXsly doffs his chapeaX to his able opponent—the
therapist Zho has broken his dream code—bXt from that time forZard takes
care to bXry the dream meaning ever deeper and deeper in noctXrnal
disgXise.

A foolish fairy  tale. Typical nineteenth centXry anthropomor-phi]ation. The
Zidespread error of concreti]ing FreXd's abstract mental strXctXres into
independent free-Zilled sprites. If only I didn't believe it!

For decades, many have regarded the first dream as a priceless docXment
Zhich represents the translation into dream langXage of the Zhole content
of the neXrosis. FreXd Zent so far as to sXg-

gest that the fXll interpretation of an initial dream ZoXld coincide Zith the
entire analysis.

The first dream in my oZn analysis is fi[ed in my mind Zith  all the
freshness and detail and feeling of the day I dreamed it forty years ago,
shortly after beginning my psychiatric residency.

I am lying on a doctor's e[amining table. The sheet is too small to cover me
properly. I can see a nXrse inserting a needle into my leg—my shin.
SXddenly there's an e[plosive hissing gXrgling soXnd—WH22222SH.

The center of the dream—the loXd Zhoosh—Zas immediately clear to me.
As a child I Zas plagXed Zith chronic sinXsitis, and every Zinter my mother
took me to Dr. Davis for a sinXs draining and flXshing. I hated his yelloZ
teeth and his fishy eye Zhich peered at me thoXgh the center of the circXlar
mirror attached to the headband otolaryngologists Xsed to Zear. As he
inserted a cannXla into my sinXs foramen I felt a sharp pain, then heard a
deafening Zhooooosh as the injected saline flXshed oXt my sinXs. /ooking
at the TXivering, disgXsting mess in the semicircXlar chrome drainage pan, I
thoXght that some of my brains had been Zashed oXt along Zith the pXs and
mXcXs.

89
-Xst as FreXd had sXggested, my first dream anticipated layer after layer of
years of analytic Zork: my fears of e[posXre, of losing my mind, of being
brain-Zashed, of sXffering a grievoXs injXry (deflation) to a long firm body
part (depicted as a shin-bone).

FreXd and many sXbseTXent analysts have caXtioned against plXnging too
TXickly into the meaning of the first dream lest early interpretation and
e[posXre to XnconscioXs material overZhelm patients and immobili]e oXr
dream-Zeaving homXncXlXs entirely. SXch admonishments have seemed to
me directed not so mXch toZard increasing the effectiveness of therapy as
toZard protecting the parochial self-interest of the analytic discipline, and
I've alZays resisted them.

SS>

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

From the I940S to I960S, an eggshell approach to therapy reigned. The
precise, delicate, phrasing of interventions Zas the topic of endless arcane
debates Zithin analytic institXtes. Bombarded Zith propaganda aboXt the
necessity for e[TXisitely timed and formXlated interpretations, novices—
fXll of aZe and fear— tiptoed carefXlly throXgh therapy, stifling their
spontaneity—and their effectiveness. I foXnd that sXch formalism Zas
coXnterprodXctive becaXse it interfered Zith the greater goal of establishing
an empathic, aXthentic relationship to the patient. To me, FreXd's Zarning
not to Zork on dreams Xntil the therapeXtic alliance is firmly established
seems strangely inverted: Zorking together on a dream is an e[cellent Zay
to bXild the therapeXtic alliance.

So I plXnged right into Irene's dream:

"So yoX hadn't read either te[t," I began, "especially not the old one."

"Yes, yes, I e[pected yoX to ask aboXt that. 2f coXrse, it doesn't make sense;
I knoZ that. BXt that's e[acdy the Zay it Zas in the dream. I had not read
the assignment—I hadn't read either te[t, bXt I especially hadn't read the
ancient one."

90
"The one that ZoXld have prepared yoX for the neZ te[t. Any hXnches
aboXt the meaning of the tZo te[ts in yoXr life?"

"Hardly a hXnch," Irene replied. "I knoZ e[acdy Zhat they mean."

I Zaited for her to go, on bXt she simply sat in silence, looking oXt the
ZindoZ. I  hadn't learned yet of Irene's irritating trait of not volXnteering a
conclXsion Xnless I e[plicitly reTXested it.

Annoyed, I let the silence last a minXte or tZo. Finally, I obliged: "And the
meaning of the tZo te[ts, Irene, is—"

"0y  brother's death, Zhen I Zas tZenty, Zas the ancient te[t. 0y  hXsband's
death to come is the modern te[t."

"So the dream is telling Xs that yoX may not be able to deal Zith yoXr
hXsband's death Xntil yoX deal first Zith yoXr brother's."

"YoX got it. 3recisely."

The e[amination of this initial dream anticipated not only the

content of therapy bXt also its process, that is the natXre of the therapist-
patient relationship. For one thing, Irene Zas alZays forthcoming and
thoXghtfXl. I never asked a TXestion ZithoXt receiving an original and
thoXghtfXl response. Did she knoZ the titles of the tZo te[ts? Indeed, she
did. Had she any hXnches aboXt Zhv she needed to read the ancient te[t in
order to Xnderstand the modern one? 2f coXrse, she kneZ precisely Zhat it
meant. Even roXtine TXestions—"What do yoX make of this?" or "Where do
yoXr thoXghts go noZ, Irene?" never failed, in five years of therapy, to reap
a fertile harvest. 2ften Irene's responses Xnnerved me: they Zere too TXick,
too precise. They broXght to my mind 0iss Fernald, my fifth-grade teacher,
Zho so often said, "Come along, Irvin," as she impatiently tapped her foot,
marked time, and Zaited for me to stop daydreaming and keep Xp Zith
some class e[ercise.

I sZept 0iss  Fernald oXt of my mind, and continXed, "And the meaning for
yoX of The Death of Innocence}'''' "Imagine Zhat it meant to me as a

91
tZenty-year-old to have my brother, Zhom I e[pected to have as a life
companion, snatched from me by a traffic accident. And then I foXnd -ack.
And imagine Zhat it means, noZ at the age of forty-five, to lose him.
Imagine Zhat it is like to have my parents, in their seventies, living and my
brother dead and my hXsband dying. Time oXt of joint. The yoXng dying
first."

Irene told me of the blessed relationship she had enjoyed Zith her brother,
Allen, tZo  years her senior. ThroXgh her adolescence he had been the
protector, the confidant, the mentor every yoXng girl dreams of. BXt then, in
one screeching moment on a street in Boston, Allen Zas dead. She told me
hoZ the police phoned the small hoXse she shared Zith college roommates,
hoZ every detail of that day Zas fro]en forever in her mind.

"I remember everything: the ring of the phone doZnstairs, my chenille
bathrobe Zith roZs of small pink and Zhite tXfts, the flopping of my fleece
slippers as I Zent doZn the steps to the alcove ne[t to the kitchen Zhere the
telephone hXng on the Zall,

90

Seven Advanced /essons in tine 1 herapy of Grief

the Zooden banister so smooth to my hand. I remember thinking that the
Zood had been Zorn smooth by all the Harvard and 5ad-cliffe
XndergradXates before me. And then that man's voice, that stranger trying to
be kind as he told me that Allen Zas dead. I sat for hoXrs staring oXt the
beveled glass of the alcove ZindoZ. I can still see the rainboZ-colored
moXnds of sooty snoZ in the side yard."

CoXndess rimes dXring therapy Ze Zere to retXrn to the dream of the tZo
te[ts and the meaning of "The Death of Innocence." The loss of her brother
marked her for life. Death e[ploded her innocence forever. Gone Zere the
myths of childhood: jXstice, predictability, a benevolent deity, a natXral
order of things, protecting parents, the safety of home. Alone and
Xnshielded against the capri-cioXsness of e[istence, Irene strXggled to attain
safety. Allen might have sXrvived, she believed, if he had had the right
emergency medical treatment. 0edicine beckoned—it offered the only hope

92
of mastery over death; and at Allen's fXneral she sXddenly decided to apply
for medical school and become a sXrgeon.

Another decision Irene made in the Zake of Allen's death Zas to have
enormoXs implications for oXr Zork in therapy.

"I figXred oXt a Zay to avoid ever getting hXrt again, I ZoXld never again
have sXch a loss if I never let anyone matter to me."

"HoZ did  that decision play oXt in yoXr life?"

"For the ne[t ten years I made no attachments, took no chances. I kneZ a
lot of men bXt I broke things off TXickly— before they got serioXs and
before I felt anything."

"BXt then something changed. YoX married. HoZ did that come aboXt?"

"I've knoZn -ack since the foXrth grade and somehoZ had alZays thoXght
he ZoXld be the one. Even Zhen he disappeared from my life and married
someone else, I kneZ he'd be back. 0y brother kneZ and respected him. I
gXess yoX coXld say my brother anointed -ack."

"So Allen's approval of -ack permitted yoX take the risk of marrying?"

"It Zasn't that simple. It took a long, long time and, even then, I refXsed to
marry -ack Xntil he promised not to die yoXng on me."

I appreciated Irene's irony and looked Xp Zith a grin to gather in her smile
in retXrn. BXt there Zas no smile. Irene Zas not being ironic, she Zas stone
serioXs.

This scenario Zas to happen again and again throXghoXt oXr Zork. I Zas the
designated voice of reason. I often took the bait: I confronted her
irrationality, argXed, appealed to her reason, tried to roXse her precise,
scientifically honed mind. 2ther times I jXst Zaited. BXt the resXlt Zas
alZays the same: she never bXdged an inch, she never relinTXished her
position. And I never got Xsed to her dXal natXre, her e[traordinary lXcidity
flanked by preposteroXs irrationality.

93
92

/esson 2. The Wall of Bodies

If Irene's initial dream anticipated the natXre of oXr fXtXre relationship, a
dream she had in the second year of therapy Zas the opposite—a beam
directed backZards, illXminating the trail Ze had already traveled together.

"I am in this office, in this chair. BXt there is a strange Zall in the middle of
the room betZeen Xs. I can't see yoX. At first I can't see the Zall distincdy;
it's irregXlar, Zith lots of crevices and protXberances. I see a small patch of
fabric, red plaid; then I recogni]e a hand, then a foot and a knee. 1oZ I
knoZ Zhat it  is—a Zall of bodies heaped one Xpon the other."

"And the feeling in the dream, Irene?" Almost alZays my first TXestion.
The feeling in a dream often leads to the center of its meaning.

"8npleasant, fearfXl. 0y  strongest feeling Zas in the beginning—Zhen I
saZ the Zall and felt lost. Alone—lost—frightened."

"Tell me aboXt the Zall."

"When I describe it noZ, it soXnds grXesome—like a heap of bodies at
AXschZit].  And that patch of red plaid—I knoZ that pattern, it Zas the
pajamas -ack Zas Zearing the night he died. Yet somehoZ the Zall Zas not
grXesome—it's simply there, something I'm inspecting and stXdying. It
might have even allayed some of my fear."

"A Zall  of bodies betZeen Xs—Zhat do yoX make of that, Irene?"

"1o mystery there. 1o mystery to the Zhole dream. It's jXst

Zhat I've been feeling all along. The dream says yoX can't really see me
becaXse of all the dead bodies, all the deaths. YoX can't imagine. 1othing
has ever happened to yoX\ YoX've had no tragedy in yoXr life."

The losses in Irene's life had moXnted. First, her brother. Then her hXsband,
Zho died at the end of oXr first year of therapy And a feZ months later her
father Zas diagnosed Zith advanced prostatic cancer, folloZed shortly by

94
her mother's descent into Al]heimer's. And then, Zhen she seemed to be
making progress in therapy, her tZenty-year-old godson—the only child of
her coXsin, a close, lifelong friend—droZned in a boating accident. It Zas
in the midst of her bitterness and despair over this last loss that she dreamed
of the Zall of bodies.

".eep  going, Irene, I'm listening."

"What I mean is, hoZ can yoX Xnderstand me? YoXr life's Xnreal—Zarm,
co]y, innocent. /ike  this office." She pointed to my packed bookshelves
behind her and to the scarlet -apanese maple bla]ing jXst oXtside the
ZindoZ. "The only  thing missing are some chint] cXshions, a fireplace, and
a crackling Zood fire. YoXr family sXrroXnds yoX—all in the same toZn.
An Xnbroken family circle. What can yoX really knoZ of loss? Do yoX think
yoX'd handle it any better? SXppose yoXr Zife or one of yoXr children Zas
to die right noZ? HoZ ZoXld  yoX do? Even that smXg striped shirt of yoXrs
—I hate it. Every time yoX Zear it, I Zince. I hate Zhat it says!"

"What does it say?"

"It says, Tve got all my problems solved. Tell me aboXt yoXrs.'"

"YoX've talked aboXt these feelings before. BXt they have sXch force today.
Why noZ? And the dream, Zhy do yoX dream this dream noZ}"

"I told yoX I Zas going to talk to Eric, and yesterday I had dinner Zith him."

"And?" I prompted her, after another of those irritating paXses of hers Zhich
implied that I shoXld myself be able to make the connection betZeen Eric
and the dream. She had mentioned this

94

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

man only once, telling me that his Zife had died ten years before and that
she had met him at a lectXre on bereavement.

95
"And he confirmed everything I've been saying. He says yoX're dead Zrong
aboXt my getting throXgh -ack's death. YoX don't get throXgh it. YoX never
get over it. Eric's got a neZ Zife and a si[-year old child, bXt the ZoXnd is
still bleeding. He talks to his dead Zife every day. He Xnderstands me. And
I'm convinced noZ that it's only the people Zho have been there Zho can
Xnderstand. There's a silent XndergroXnd society oXt there—"

"8ndergroXnd society?" I interrXpted.

"2f  people Zho really knoZ—all  the sXrvivors, the bereaved. All this time
yoX've been Xrging me to detach from -ack, to tXrn toZard life, to form a
neZ love—it's all been a mistake. It's a mistake of smXgness, from those
like yoX Zho have never lost."

"So, only the bereaved can treat the bereaved?"

"Somebody Zho's been throXgh it."

"I've been hearing that stXff ever since I entered this field!" I bXrst oXt at
her. "2nly alcoholics can treat alcoholics? 2r addicts to treat addicts? And
do yoX have to have an eating disorder to treat anore[ia, or be depressed or
manic to treat affective disorders? HoZ aboXt being schi]ophrenic to treat
schi]ophrenia?" Irene kneZ hoZ to press my bXtton. She had an Xncanny
knack of locating and ]eroing into my major irritants.

"2h no, yoX don't!" she shot back. "I Zas captain of the varsity debating
team at 5adcliffe and I knoZ that strategy— 5edXctio ad absXrdXm! BXt it's
not going to Zork. Admit  it, yoX knoZ there's trXth in Zhat I say."

"1o, I  disagree. YoX're totally overlooking the training of therapists! That's
Zhat training in my field  is all aboXt—to acTXire sensitivity, empathy—to
be able to enter the Zorld of another, to e[perience Zhat the patient
e[periences."

I Zas irritated all right. And I  had learned not to hold back. We Zorked
mXch better together Zhen I jXst cXt loose Zith my feelings. Irene coXld
come into my office so depressed she coXld hardly speak. BXt once Ze
tangled aboXt something, she inevitably became

96
enlivened. I kneZ I Zas assXming -ack's role here. He Zas the only one
ever to stand Xp to her. Her icy demeanor Zas daXnting to others (her
sXrgery residents referred to her as "The 4Xeen"), bXt -ack never deferred to
her. She told me he took no pains to conceal his feelings, often Zalking oXt
of the room mXttering, "I don't have time for this bXllshit."

1ot only Zas I  irritated at her insistence that only bereaved therapists can
treat bereaved patients, bXt I Zas also angry at Eric for reinforcing her vieZ
that bereavement is never-ending. That Zas part of an ongoing debate Zith
Irene. I Zas taking a Zell-established, soXnd position: namely, that the Zork
of moXrning consists of gradXally detaching oneself from the one Zho died
and redirecting one's energy toZard others. FreXd first elaborated this
Xnderstanding of grief in 191 in 0oXrning and 0elancholia, Zhich, since
then, has been sXpported by mXch clinical observation and empirical
research.

In my oZn research, completed jXst before I took on Irene's case, every
single ZidoZ  and ZidoZer I stXdied gradXally detached from the dead
spoXse and then re-invested into something or someone else. And that Zas
trXe for those Zith the most loving of marriages. In fact, Ze foXnd strong
evidence that many of the ZidoZs Zho had had the best marriages Zent
throXgh the bereavement and detachment process more easily than those
Zho had had a deeply conflicted one. (The e[planation for this parado[ lay,
it seemed to me, in "regret": for those Zho had spent their lives married to
the Zrong person, bereavement Zas more complicated becaXse they also
had to grieve for themselves, for their many sTXandered years.) Since
Irene's marriage appeared to me to have been e[ceptionally loving and
sXpportive, I had initially predicted a relatively Xncomplicated
bereavement.

BXt Irene Zas highly critical of most traditional attitXdes aboXt
bereavement. She hated my comments aboXt detachment and dismissed my
research oXt of hand: "We bereaved have learned to give the ansZers
investigators Zant. We have learned that the Zorld Zants Xs to recover
TXickly and it becomes impa-

96

97
Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

tient Zith those Zho cling too long to losses."

She deeply resented any sXggestion that she let go of -ack: tZo years after
his death, his personal belongings still lay in his desk draZers, his photos
hXng throXghoXt the hoXse, his favorite maga]ines and books all in place;
and she continXed long daily conversations Zith him. I Zorried that the
conversation Zith Eric ZoXld set therapy back months by reinforcing her
idea of hoZ Zrong I Zas. 1oZ  it  ZoXld be more difficXlt than ever to
persXade her that eventXally she ZoXld recover from her grief. As for her
foolish belief in a secret silent society of the bereaved Zho all agreed Zith
her, that Zas jXst another of her legion of irrational conceits. 1o point in
dignifying that Zith  an ansZer.

BXt, as alZays, some of Irene's comments hit home. A story is told aboXt
the SZiss scXlptor, Alberto Giacometti, Zhose leg Zas broken in a traffic
accident. While lying in the street, Zaiting for the ambXlance, he Zas heard
to say, "Finally, finally, something has happened to me." I knoZ e[actly
Zhat he meant. Irene had my nXmber, all right. Teaching at Stanford for
over thirty years, I've lived in the same hoXse, Zatched my children Zalk to
the same schools, never had to face darkness. 1o hard, Xntimely deaths: my
father and mother died old, he seventy, she in her nineties. 0y sister, seven
years older, is healthy. I have lost no close friends, and my foXr children are
thriving.

For a thinker Zho has embraced an e[istential frame of reference, sXch a
benign, shielded life is a liability. 0any  times I have yearned to ventXre oXt
of the Xniversity's ivory toZer into the travails of the real Zorld. For years I
imagined spending a sabbatical as a blXe-collar Zorker, perhaps as an
ambXlance driver in Detroit or a short order-cook in the BoZery or a
sandZich maker in a 0anhattan deli. BXt I never did: the siren call of a
colleagXe's 9enetian apartment or a felloZship to Bellagio on /ake Como
Zere irresistible. I've never even had the groZth e[perience of a marital
separation and facing adXlt aloneness. I met 0arilyn, my Zife, Zhen I Zas
fifteen and decided on the spot that this Zas the Zoman for me. (I even bet
my best friend fifty dollars that I ZoXld

98
marry her—and collected eight years later.) 2Xr marriage has not alZays
been placid; thank God for the StXrm Xnd Dra?ig; bXt throXghoXt my life
she has been a loving friend, alZays there at my side.

Sometimes I have secretly envied patients living on the edge Zho have the
coXrage to change their lives radically, Zho move, leave jobs, change
professions, divorce, start all over again. I Zorry aboXt being a voyeXr and
Zonder if I covertly  encoXrage my patients to take a heroic plXnge for me.

All these things I say to Irene. I omit nothing. I tell her she is right aboXt my
life—Xp to a point.

"Yet yoX're not right Zhen yoX say I have no e[perience of tragedy. I do
Zhatever I can to bring tragedy closer to me. I think aboXt death all the
time. When I'm Zith yoX I often imagine hoZ it ZoXld  be if my Zife  Zere
fatally ill,  and each time I'm filled Zith indescribable sadness. I am aZare,
fXlly aZare, that I'm on the march, that I've moved into another life stage.
Taking early retirement from Stanford is an irreversible step. All the signs
of aging—my torn knee cartilage, my fading vision, my back aches, my
senile plaTXes, my graying beard and hair, my dreams of my oZn death—
tell me I'm moving toZard the end of my life.

"For ten years, Irene, I chose to Zork Zith patients dying of cancer hoping
that they ZoXld draZ me closer to the tragic core of life. That, indeed,
happened, and I Zent back into three years of therapy, seeing 5ollo 0ay,
Zhose book E[istence had been so important to me in my psychiatric
training. That therapy Zas Xnlike any other personal Zork I had done
before, and I plXnged deeply into the e[perience of my oZn death."

Irene nodded. I kneZ that nod—that characteristic clXster of movements,
one sharp chin jerk folloZed by tZo or three soft nods, her somatic 0orse
code signifying that I had made a satisfactory response. I had passed the test
—for noZ.

BXt I Zasn't finished Zith the dream. "Irene, I think there's more to yoXr
dream." I referred to my notes (almost the only notes I take dXring a session
are of dreams: oZing to their evanes-

99

beven Advanced /essons in the Therapy oj Grief

cence, patients often repress or distort them immediately) and read aloXd
the first part of her dream: "I am in this office, in this chair. BXt there is a
strange Zall in the middle of the room betZeen Xs. I can't see yoX."

"What impresses me," I continXed, "is that last sentence. In the dream it is
yoX Zho can't see me. Yet this Zhole session Ze've been discXssing it the
other Zay aroXnd—that it is I Zho don't see yoX. /et me ask yoX
something: a feZ minXtes ago Zhen I talked aboXt my aging, yoX knoZ my
knee sXrgery, my eyes—"

"Yes, yes, I heard all that" Irene e[claimed, rXshing me on.

"YoX heard it—bXt, as XsXal, Zhenever I mention something aboXt my
health, yoXr eyes gla]ed over. /ike those coXple of Zeeks after my eye
sXrgery, Zhen I Zas obvioXsly having a roXgh time and Zore dark glasses,
yoX never asked aboXt the sXrgery or inTXired aboXt hoZ I Zas doing."

"I don't need to knoZ aboXt yoXr health. I'm the patient here."

"2h, no, it's mXch more than that, more than lack of interest, more than
yoXr being the patient and me the doctor. YoX avoid me. YoX block yoXrself
from learning anything aboXt me. Especially anything that, in some Zay,
diminishes me. From the very beginning I told yoX that becaXse of oXr
former social relationship and becaXse of oXr mXtXal friends, Earl and
Emily, I coXld not conceal myself from yoX. Yet yoX've never once
e[pressed any interest in knoZing anything aboXt me. Don't yoX think that
odd?"

"When I started seeing yoX, I Zas not going to take the risk of losing
someone important to me again. I coXldn't go throXgh that. So I had only
tZo choices—"

As she so often did, Irene stopped, as thoXgh I shoXld be able to divine the
rest of her statement. AlthoXgh I didn't Zant to prompt her, it Zas best, for

100
noZ, to keep the floZ going.

"And those tZo choices Zere?"

"Well, not to let yoX matter to me—bXt that Zas impossible. 2r not to see
yoX as a real person Zith a narrative."

"A narrative?"

"Yes, a life narrative—proceeding from a beginning to an end. I Zant to
keep yoX oXtside of time."

"Today, as XsXal, yoX Zalked into my office and straight to yoXr chair,
ZithoXt looking at me. YoX alZays avoid my eyes. That Zhat yoX mean by
'oXtside of time?'"

She nodded. "/ooking at yoX ZoXld make yoX too real."

"And real people have to die."

"1oZ  yoX've got it."

/esson 3. Grief 5age

"I jXst heard, Irene," I began a session one afternoon, "that my brother-in-
laZ died a feZ hoXrs ago. SXddenly. A coronary. I'm obvioXsly shaken and
not at fXll strength"—I heard my voice TXaver—"I'll do my best to stay
present Zith yoX."

It Zas hard to say, hard to do, bXt I felt I had no choice.

0orton,  the hXsband of my only sister, had been a dear friend and an
important presence in my life since I Zas fifteen. I had been staggered by
my sister's midday call and immediately booked the ne[t flight to
Washington to join her. As I set aboXt canceling my schedXle for the ne[t
feZ days, I saZ that I had an appointment Zith Irene in tZo hoXrs Zhich

101
ZoXld still leave me time to catch my flight. ShoXld I keep that
appointment?

In oXr three years together, Irene had never come late for an appointment or
missed one, not even dXring the time of horror Zhen -ack's brain tXmor Zas
ravaging his brain and persona. Despite the nightmare of Zitnessing her
hXsband's relendess decon-stitXtion, Irene had, throXghoXt, been faithfXl to
oXr Zork. And I had been, too. Since my first session Zhen I promised her,
"I Zill  see this throXgh Zith yoX," I had committed myself to engaging her
as genXinely as I coXld. 0y choice, then, on this day of grief, seemed clear:
I ZoXld meet Zith her and I ZoXld be honest.

BXt Irene didn't respond. After Ze had sat together in silence a coXple of
minXtes, I prodded: "Where do yoXr thoXghts go?"

"I Zas Zondering hoZ  old he Zas."

"Seventy. He Zas jXst aboXt to retire from his medical practice." I paXsed
and Zaited. For Zhat? 3erhaps jXst the common decency of a brief
condolence. 2r even an e[pression of gratitXde

for my Zillingness to see her despite my grief.

Silence. Irene sat Xnspeaking, her eyes apparently fi[ed on a small pale
coffee stain on the carpet.

"Irene, Zhat's happening in the space betZeen Xs today?" "WithoXt fail I
asked this TXestion every session, in accordance Zith my conviction that
nothing took precedence over e[ploring oXr relationship.

"Well, he mXst have been a nice man," she said, her eyes never moving.
"2therZise,  yoX ZoXldn't feel so sad."

"2h, come on Irene. The trXth. What's going on inside?"

SXddenly she looked Xp, her eyes bla]ing. "0y hXsband died at forty-five,
and if I can go into the 2.5. every day and operate on my patients and rXn

102
my office and teach my stXdents, then yoX sXre as hell can come in here and
see me!"

It Zasn't so mXch her Zords that stXnned me bXt the soXnd of them. That
harsh deep timbre Zas not Irene. It Zas not her voice. It Zas like the
preternatXral gXttXral voice of the yoXng girl in The E[orcist. Before I coXld
remark on it, Irene leaned doZn to pick Xp her pXrse.

"I'm leaving!"  she said.

0y  calf mXscles tensed—I believe I Zas preparing myself to tackle her if
she bolted for the door. "2h no, yoX're not. 1ot after that. YoX're staying
right here and talking this oXt."

"I can't. Can't Zork, can't stay here Zith yoX. 1ot fit to be Zith anyone."

"There's only one rXle here in this office, that yoX say e[acdy Zhat's on
yoXr mind. YoX're doing yoXr job. YoX've never done it better."

Dropping her pXrse on the floor, Irene slXmped back in her chair. "I told yoX
that after my brother died, I alZays ended my relationships Zith men the
same Zay."

"HoZ? Tell me again."

"They'd have some mishap, some problem, maybe get sick, and I'd get nasty
and cXt them oXt of my life. A TXick sXrgical incision! I cXt clean and I cXt
sharp."

102

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

"BecaXse yoX'd compare their problem Zith the immensity of losing Allen?
That ZoXld make yoX bitter?"

She nodded her appreciation. "That Zas most of it, I'm pretty sXre. Also,
that I jXst didn't Zant them to matter to me. I didn't Zant to hear aboXt their
pXny problems."

103
"And Zith  me today?"

"Color it red! 5age! I  Zanted to throZ something at yoX!"

"BecaXse it felt like I Zas comparing my loss Zith yoXrs?"

"Yes. And then I thoXght that Zhen Ze finish oXr session, yoX'll take yoXr
loss Xp yoXr little garden path to yoXr Zife, Zho'll be there Zaiting Zith the
rest of yoXr tidy, co]y life. That's Zhen it tXrns red."

0y  office, only a coXple hXndred feet from my hoXse, is a comfortable red
tile-roofed cottage enveloped in the lXsh greens and violets of cypress,
Zisteria, frangipani, and Spanish lavender. ThoXgh Irene loved the serenity
of my office, she often made sarcastic comments aboXt my pictXre-book
life.

"It's not jXst yoX I feel angry at," she continXed. "It's everyone Zhose life is
intact. YoX've told me aboXt ZidoZs Zho hate being ZithoXt a role, Zho
hate being the fifth Zheel at dinner parties. BXt it's not the role, nor being
the fifth Zheel that matters: it's hating everyone else for having a life, it's
envy, it's being filled Zith bitterness. Do yoX think I like feeling this Zay?"

"A litde Zhile  ago Zhen yoX Zere preparing to Zalk oXt of here, yoX said
yoX Zeren't fit to be Zith anyone."

"Well, am I? Do yoX Zant to be Zith someone Zho hates yoX becaXse yoXr
Zife is alive? Does anyone Zant that kind of person aroXnd? The black
oo]e—remember? 1o one Zants to be tarred, do they?"

"I stopped yoX from leaving, didn't I?"

1o ansZer.

"I'm thinking of  hoZ di]]y   yoX mXst feel to be so angry at me and yet so
close, so gratefXl." She nodded. "A litde loXder, Irene. Can't TXite hear
yoX."

"Well, I got di]]y   thinking aboXt Zhy yoX told me aboXt yoXr brother-in-
laZ today."

104
"YoX seem sXspicioXs."

"9ery."

"YoX have a hXnch?"

"0ore  than a hXnch. I think yoX Zere trying to manipXlate me. See hoZ I
ZoXld react. Giving me a test."

"1o Zonder  yoX e[ploded. 0aybe it'll  help if I  tell yoX e[actly Zhat Zas
going on inside of me today after I got the neZs of 0orton's death." I told
her hoZ I canceled the rest of my schedXle bXt decided to see her and Zhy
"I coXldn't cancel it—not after yoXr coXrage in alZays coming here no
matter Zhat. BXt," I continXed, "I still had to face the TXestion hoZ to be
Zith yoX and deal Zith my loss at the same time.

"So Zhat options did I have today, Irene? To shXt doZn and ZithdraZ from
yoX? That ZoXld have been Zorse than canceling. To try  to stay close and
honest Zith yoX and not tell yoX aboXt it? Impossible—a recipe for disaster:
I learned long ago that Zhen tZo people have something big betZeen them
and don't talk aboXt it, they don't talk of anything else of importance either.
This area here"—I gestXred toZ r ard the air space betZeen Xs—Ze need to
keep it clean and free, and that's my job as Zell as yoXrs. So that's Zhy I
told yoX Zhat Zas happening to me straight. Straight as I coXld—no
manipXlation, no test, no Xlterior motive."

2nce again, Irene needed to let me knoZ that I had made a reasonably
intelligent response.

/ater in  the session, jXst before Ze ended, Irene apologi]ed for her remark.
The folloZing  Zeek, she told me of describing the incident to a friend Zho
Zas aghast at her crXelty toZard me, and apologi]ed once again.

"1o apology Zas needed," I reassXred her, and I meant it, really

meant it. In fact, in a cXrioXs Zay I had Zelcomed her telling me I

sXre as hell coXld see her: it Zas enlivening, it Zas real, it broXght me

105
. closer to her. It Zas the trXth aboXt hoZ she felt toZard me. 2r pan

of the trXth—and I hoped that the time ZoXld come Zhen I ZoXld

104

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

hear the rest of it.

Irene's rage Zas deep and pervasive. ThoXgh it flared only occasionally into
the open, it alZays rXmbled jXst beloZ the sXrface. At first, I Zasn't mXch
concerned aboXt it. 0y research had reassXred me that it Zas no more
Zorrisome than persistent gXilt or regret or denial and ZoXld soon dissipate.
BXt in this instance, as often in my Zork Zith Irene, the research Zas
misleading. Again and again, I have foXnd that "statistically significant"
trXth (often Zith the e[ceptions—the "oXtliers"—e[clXded from the
calcXlation for statistical reasons) had little relevance to the trXth of my
XniTXe encoXnter Zith the person of flesh and blood before me.

I had first encoXntered Irene's rage dXring the second month of therapy.
"What feelings did yoX take home from oXr last session?" I asked. "Any
thoXghts aboXt me dXring the Zeek?" I pose this type of TXestion often, as
part of my campaign to focXs therapeXtic attention on the here-and-noZ—
on the encoXnter betZeen me and the patient.

She sat in silence for a Zhile, then asked, "Do yoX think aboXt me betZeen
sessions?" AlthoXgh this TXestion from a patient, Zhich most therapists
dread, is not Xncommon, I somehoZ hadn't e[pected it from Irene. 3erhaps
I hadn't e[pected her to care, or at least to acknoZledge she cared.

"I—I—I  often think aboXt yoXr sitXation," I stXttered. Wrong ansZer!

She sat for a moment, then stood. "I'm leaving," she said and stomped oXt,
not failing to slam the door behind her.

HoZ easy it is for non-interactive therapists, I thoXght, to deflect that
TXestion of hers by sXch ploys as: "Why do yoX ask?" or, "Why noZ?" or

106
"What are yoXr fantasies or yoXr Zishes aboXt that?" For therapists Zho are,
like myself, committed to a more egalitarian, mXtXally transparent
relationship, it's not so easy. 3erhaps becaXse the TXestion reveals the limits
of therapeXtic aXthenticity: no matter hoZ genXine therapists try to be, hoZ
intimate, hoZ honest, there remains an Xnbridgeable gap, a fXndamental
ineTXality betZeen therapist and patient.

I kneZ that Irene hated my thinking of her as a "sitXation"— and hated, too,
that she'd alloZed me to mean so mXch to her. I might, of coXrse, have been
more sensitive and Xsed a Zarmer and more personal Zord than "sitXation."
BXt I believe that no appropriate response of mine ZoXld have giver her
Zhat she Zanted. She Zanted me to be thinking other thoXghts—loving,
admiring, sensXal ones or, perhaps, doting. Yes, doting—that's the Zord.

When she had finished her cigarette, she Zalked back in Zith great aplomb
and took her seat as thoXgh nothing XnXsXal had happened. I continXed by
appealing to her sense of reality.

"2f  coXrse," I pointed oXt matter-of-factly, "patients think more often aboXt
their therapists than therapists think aboXt them. After all, the therapist has
many patients, Zhereas a patient has only one therapist. The same thing Zas
trXe for me Zhen I Zas in therapy and isn't it trXe for yoXr oZn sXrgery
patients, and for yoXr stXdents? Don't yoX loom larger in their minds than
they in yoXrs?"

The sitXation is not really so clear-cXt. I didn't talk aboXt the fact that
therapists do think aboXt patients betZeen sessions— especially aboXt the
problematic ones Zho, in one Zay or another, ve[ the therapist. Therapists
may ponder their strong emotional reactions to a patient or pX]]le aboXt the
best technical approach. (A therapist Zho becomes overly caXght Xp in
angry, vindictive, loving, or erotic fantasies aboXt a patient shoXld seek a
discXssion Zith a colleagXe-friend, a professional consXltant, or a personal
therapist.)

2f  coXrse, I didn't tell Irene that I often thoXght aboXt her betZeen sessions.
She pX]]led me. I Zorried aboXt her. Why Zas she not getting better? The
great majority of ZidoZs  I had treated began to improve after the first year;
every one shoZed significant improvement by the end of the second year.

107
BXt not Irene. Her despair and hopelessness continXed to deepen. She
e[perienced no joy in her life. After pXtting her daXghter to bed, she Zept
every evening; she persisted in engaging in lengthy conversations Zith her
dead hXsband; she rejected all invitations to

106

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

meet neZ people and refXsed even to consider the possibility of another
important relationship Zith a male.

I'm an impatient therapist, and my frXstration greZ. And so did my concern
for Irene: the magnitXde of her sXffering began to alarm me. I Zorried aboXt
sXicide—I am convinced that she ZoXld have taken her life if it Zere not
for her daXghter. 2n three occasions I sent her to colleagXes for formal
consXltation.

ThoXgh I foXnd Irene's major erXptions of grief rage ta[ing, even more Zere
her milder bXt more pervasive e[pressions of rage. Her list of grievances
aboXt me Zas long, and groZing; and Ze rarely got throXgh an hoXr ZithoXt
some e[pression of anger.

She Zas angry at me for attempting to help her to detach from -ack and
direct her energy elseZhere and for encoXraging her to meet other men.
And angry at me for not being -ack. As a resXlt of oXr deep engagement,
oXr intimate e[changes, oXr fighting, oXr mXtXal caring, it Zas Zith me that
she most appro[imated the feelings she had had Zith her hXsband. And
then, at the end of the hoXr, she hated having to go back to a life Zith
neither me nor -ack. That's Zhat made the ending of every session so
tXmXltXoXs. She hated the reminder that oXr relationship had formal
boXndaries, and, no matter hoZ I signaled that Ze Zere at the end of oXr
hoXr, she often e[ploded.

"YoX call this a real relationship? This is not real! YoX look at the clock and
jXst kick me oXt, throZ me aZay!"

108
Sometimes she sat there at the end of the hoXr glaring and refXsing to
bXdge. Any appeals to reason—to pointing oXt the necessity for schedXles,
to her oZn schedXling of patients, to sXggestions that she Zatch the clock
and end the hoXr, to repeating that my ending the hoXr Zas not a signal of
rejection—all these fell on deaf ears. Far more often than not, she left my
office angry.

She Zas angry at me for being important to her and angry that I ZoXldn't do
some of the things -ack had done: for e[ample, compliment her on all her
good points—her appearance, her resoXrcefXlness, her intelligence. We
often had pitched battles aboXt compliments. I felt a recitation of
compliments ZoXld

infantili]e  her bXt she pXt so mXch emphasis on it, Zas so insistent, that I
often complied. I asked her Zhat she Zanted me to say and practically
repeated her Zords back, alZays trying to inclXde some original
observation. Yet Zhat seemed like a bi]arre charade to me almost ZithoXt
fail raised her spirits. BXt only temporarily: she had holes in her pockets,
and by the ne[t session she insisted I do it again.

She Zas angry at my presXming to Xnderstand her. If I tried to combat her
pessimism by reminding her that she Zas in the midst of a process that had
a beginning and an end, and by offering reassXrance from some of the
resXlts from my research, she responded angrily, "YoX're depersonali]ing
me. YoX're disregarding Zhat's XniTXe in my e[perience."

Any optimism I e[pressed aboXt her recovery she invariably tXrned into an
accXsation that I Zanted her to forget -ack.

Any mention of the possibility of her meeting another man Zas a mine
field. For the most part she Zas contemptXoXs of the men she met and angry
at me for sXggesting she e[amine her jXdgmentalism. Any practical
sXggestion I offered ignited a major erXption. "If I Zant to date," she said
fXrioXsly, "I can figXre oXt hoZ to do it! Why pay yoX good money for
dating advice Zhen my friends can give me the same thing?"

She greZ angry if I offered concrete sXggestions aboXt anything: "Stop
trying to 'fi['  things!"  she said, "That's Zhat my father tried to do my Zhole

109
life."

She Zas angry at my impatience Zith her progress, and at my failing to
acknoZledge the efforts she had made to help herself (bXt never mentioned
to me).

Irene Zanted me strong and healthy. Any infirmity—a sprained back, a
knee injXry reTXiring meniscXs sXrgery, a cold, a case of flX—elicited mXch
annoyance. I kneZ that she Zas apprehensive as Zell, bXt she kept that Zell
concealed.

0ost  of all, she Zas angry at my being alive Zhen -ack Zas dead.

1one of this Zas easy for me. I have never relished angry con-

108

frontations and, in my personal life, generally avoid angry people. BecaXse
I am a deliberate thinker and Zriter, and confrontation tends to sloZ my
thoXghts, I have, throXghoXt my career, declined pXblic debate and
discoXraged all inTXires aboXt my becoming a departmental chairman.

So hoZ did I cope Zith Irene's anger? For one thing, I leaned on the old
therapy adage that one mXst separate role and person. 2ften mXch of a
patient's anger toZards a therapist is related to role, not to his or her person.
"Don't take it personally," yoXng therapists are taXght. 2r, at least, don't
take everything personally. 0ake an attempt to discriminate betZeen Zhat
belongs to yoXr person and Zhat to yoXr role. It seemed self evident that
mXch of Irene's anger belonged elseZhere— life, destiny, God, cosmic
indifference—bXt she simply discharged it Xpon her nearest target: me, her
therapist. Irene kneZ that her anger oppressed me, and let me knoZ in many
Zays. 2ne day, for e[ample, Zhen my secretary called her to reschedXle an
appointment becaXse I had to see the dentist, Irene's replied, "2h, Zell,
seeing the dentist is probably a pleasXre for him compared to seeing me."

110
BXt perhaps the main reason I Zas not groXnd doZn by Irene's rage Zas that
I alZays kneZ that it masked her profoXnd sadness, despair, and fear.
Whenever she e[pressed anger toZard me, I sometimes responded Zith a
refle[ irritation  and impatience, bXt more often Zith compassion. 0any of
Irene's images or phrases haXnted me. 2ne, in particXlar, set Xp
hoXsekeeping in my mind and never failed to soften my e[perience of her
grief rage. It Zas in one of her airport dreams (dXring the first tZo years
after her hXsband's death, she often Zandered throXgh airports in her
dreams).

"I am dashing throXgh a terminal. /ooking for -ack. I don't knoZ the
airline. I don't knoZ the flight  nXmber. I am desperate . . . scanning the lists
of departXre flights for some clXe—bXt nothing makes sense—all the
destinations are Zritten in nonsense syllables. Then hope appears—I can
read one sign over a departXre gate: "0ikado," it says. I rXsh to the gate.
BXt too late.

The plane has jXst left and I Zoke Xp crying."

"That destination—0ikado? What are yoXr associations to 0ikado?" I
asked.

"I don't need associations," she said, flicking aZay my TXestion. "I knoZ
e[actly Zhy  I dreamed of 0ikado.  I Xsed to sing the operetta Zhen I Zas a
child. There's a verse in it that Zill not go aZay:

thoXgh the night may come too soon Ze have years and years of afternoon.

Irene stopped and looked at me, eyes glistening Zith tears. 1o point in
saying any more. 1ot for her. 1ot for me. She Zas beyond comforting.
From that day on, the line "Ze have years and years of afternoon"
reverberated in my mind. She and -ack had never had their share of
afternoons, and for that I coXld forgive her everything.

0y  third advanced lesson, grief rage, proved of great valXe in other clinical
sitXations. Where in the past I had generally veered too TXickly aZay from
anger, attempting to Xnderstand and resolve it as e[peditioXsly as possible,

111
noZ I Zas learning hoZ to contain anger, hoZ to seek it oXt and plXnge into
it. And the lesson's specific vehicle? That's Zhere the black oo]e comes in.

110

/esson 4. The Black 0

o]e

At the time of my brother-in-laZ's death, Zhen threatening to Zalk oXt and
asking Zhether I Zanted to be Zith someone Zho hated me becaXse my
Zife Zas alive, Irene had referred to a "black oo]e." "5emember?" she had
asked. "1o one Zants to be tarred, do they?" It Zas a metaphor she had
invoked in almost every session dXring the first tZo years of therapy.

What Zas the black oo]e? 2ver and over, she strained to find the precise
Zords. "It's some black, hideoXs, acrid sXbstance that seeps oXt of me and
spreads aroXnd me in a pool. The black oo]e is vile and noisome. It repels
and revolts anyone Zho approaches me. It tars them too, pXts them in great
danger."

ThoXgh the black oo]e had many meanings, first and foremost it signified
her grief rage. Hence her hating me for having a living spoXse. Irene's
dilemma Zas aZfXl: She coXld remain silent, choking on her oZn fXry, and
feel desperately alone. 2r she coXld e[plode in rage, driving everyone
aZay, and feel desperately alone.

Since the image of the black oo]e Zas deeply etched in her mind, not to be
dislodged by reason or rhetoric, I Xsed the metaphor to gXide my therapy.
To dissolve it, I needed not the therapeXtic Zord, bXt the therapeXtic act.

Hence, I tried to stay close to her in her rage, to face doZn her anger—as
-ack had done. I had to engage her, Zresde Zith her fXry, refXse to let her
pXsh me aZay. Her anger took many shapes—she Zas forever setting tests
and traps for me. 2ne day she set a particXlarly treacheroXs one Zhich
provided an aXspicioXs opportXnity for the therapeXtic act.

2ne day, after several months of severe agitation and discoXr-

112
agement, she arrived at my office ine[plicably calm and content.

"It's ZonderfXl to see yoX so tranTXil," I remarked. "HoZ have yoX
achieved it?"

"I jXst made a landmark decision," she said. "I've jettisoned all e[pectations
for personal happiness or self-fXlfillment. 1o more yearning for love, for
se[, for companionship, for artistic creation. From noZ on I'm going to
devote myself entirely to fXlfilling my job description—being a mother and
a sXrgeon." All this she said Zith an air of great composXre and Zell-being.

DXring the previoXs feZ Zeeks, I had become greatly concerned aboXt the
intensity and relentlessness of her despair and Zondered hoZ mXch more
she coXld endXre. So, despite the odd abrXptness of her change, I Zas so
gratefXl that she had foXnd some Zay, any Zay, to diminish her pain that I
chose not to inTXire farther into its soXrce. Instead, I took it as a blessed
event—not Xnlike the peace achieved by many BXddhists Zho, throXgh
meditative practice, alleviate sXffering by systematically detaching
themselves from all personal cravings.

lb be honest, I did not e[pect Irene's transformation to endXre, bXt I hoped
that even a temporary respite from her relendess pain might initiate a more
positive cycle in her life. If a state of calm permitted her to stop tormenting
herself, to make adaptive decisions, to develop neZ friends, perhaps even to
meet a sXitable man, then I believed it made little difference hoZ she
initially  achieved that state of mind: she coXld simply pXll Xp the ladder and
ascend to the ne[t level.

The ne[t day, hoZever, she phoned in a fXry: "Do yoX reali]e Zhat yoX've
done? What kind of therapist are yoX? YoXr caring for me! All pretense!
3retense! The trXth is yoX're Zilling to sit back and calmly Zatch me
renoXnce everything vital in my life—all love, joy, e[citement—
everything! 1o, no, it's more than jXst sitting back, yoX're Zilling to be an
accomplice to my self-mXrder!"

2nce again, she threatened to leave therapy, bXt I finally persXaded her to
retXrn for the ne[t hoXr.

113
2ver the ne[t coXple of days, I spent a lot of time going

112

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

throXgh the seTXence of events. The more I thoXght aboXt it, the angrier I
became. 2nce again, I had played the balloon-headed Charley BroZn trying
to kick the football that /Xcy invariably  pXlls aZay at the last second. By
the time oXr ne[t session rolled aroXnd, my anger matched Irene's. That
session Zas less like therapy than a Zrestling match. It Zas the most serioXs
fight Ze had had. The accXsations gXshed oXt of her.

"YoX've given on me! YoX Zant me to compromise by killing vital parts of
myself!"

I made no pretense of empathi]ing or Xnderstanding her position, "I'm sick
and tired," I told her, "of yoXr mine fields. I'm sick and tired of yoXr setting
tests for me that more often than not I fail. And of all the tests, this is the
dirtiest, most treacheroXs one.

"We have too mXch Zork to do Irene," I finished, taking a line from her
dead hXsband, "We don't have time for this bXllshit."

It Zas one of oXr best hoXrs. At its end (after, of coXrse, another skirmish
aboXt ending on time and her accXsing me of throZing her oXt of the
office), oXr therapeXtic alliance Zas stronger than ever. 1either in my
te[tbooks nor in my sXpervision or classroom teaching, ZoXld I ever dream
of advising a stXdent to tangle angrily Zith a patient; yet sXch a session
invariably moved Irene forZard.

It Zas the metaphor of the black oo]e that gXided these efforts. By making
contact, emotional contact, by Zrestling Zith her (I speak figXratively,
thoXgh there Zere times I felt Ze Zere on the brink of a physical strXggle), I
Zas proving again and again that the black oo]e Zas a fiction that neither
tarred, nor repelled, nor endangered me. Irene clXng so strongly to the
metaphor that she Zas convinced each time I approached her rage that I
ZoXld either abandon her or die.

114
Finally, in an effort to demonstrate once and for all that her anger ZoXld
neither destroy me nor drive me aZay, I laid doZn a neZ therapy groXnd
rXle: "Whenever yoX really e[plode at me, Ze Zill aXtomatically schedXle
an e[tra appointment that Zeek." This act proved highly effective; in
retrospect, I consider it inspired.

The black oo]e metaphor Zas particXlarly poZerfXl becaXse it Zas
overdetermined: it Zas a single image that satisfied and e[pressed several
different XnconscioXs dynamics. Grief rage Zas one important meaning.
BXt there Zere others: for e[ample, the belief that she Zas poisonoXs,
contaminated, fatally jin[ed. "Anyone," she to said to me one session,
"Zhoever sets foot in the black oo]e perimeter is signing their oZn death
Zarrant."

"So yoX dare not love again becaXse yoX can offer only a 0edXsa-love that
ZoXld destroy anyone Zho approaches yoX?"

"All  the men I've loved have died—my hXsband, my father, my brother, my
godson, and Sandy, Zhom I've not yet told yoX aboXt—a mentally ill
boyfriend Zho, tZenty years ago, committed sXicide."

"Coincidence again! YoX've got to let go of it!" I insisted. "It's bad lXck, and
it has no implications for the fXtXre. The dice have no memory."

"Coincidence, coincidence—yoXr favorite term!" she scoffed. "The proper
term is karma, and it's clearly telling me that I mXst love no other man."

Her jin[ed self image reminded me of -oe Bfstplk, the character in the /iF
Abner comic strip over Zhose head an ominoXs black cloXd eternally
hovers. HoZ Zas I to Xndermine Irene's belief in a cXrsed karma? I
Xltimately approached it mXch as I did her rage. 0ore than Zords Zere
needed: I had to offer a therapeXtic act, and that consisted of disregarding
her Zarnings, of repeatedly coming close to her, of moving into the jin[ed,
to[ic  space, and remaining alive and healthy.

Still another meaning of the black oo]e Zas connected in Irene's mind Zith
a dream she had once had of a beaXtifXl dark-eyed Zoman, Zho Zore a red
rose in her hair and reclined on a sofa. "As I approached closer, I reali]e

115
that the Zoman is not as she has seemed: her sofa is a bier, her eyes are dark
not Zith beaXty bXt Zith death, and the crimson rose is no floZer bXt a
bloody mortal ZoXnd.

"I knoZ,"  Irene Zent on, "I am this Zoman and anyone approaching me
Zill,  ipso facto, be introdXced to death—another

114

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy oj Grief

reason not to get too close."

The image of the Zoman Zith the crimson rose in her hair recalled to my
mind the plot of The 0an in  the 0a]e,  an e[traordinary fXtXristic novel by
3hilip Dick  in Zhich a man is sent to a neZly discovered Zorld to make
contact Zith an advanced race of beings. ThoXgh he employs every
imaginable commXnicational device—geometrical symbols, mathematical
invariants, mXsical themes, hailing, yelling, arm Zaving—he is, in every
instance, sXblimely ignored. BXt his efforts have distXrbed the tranTXillity
of the beings Zho do not alloZ his hXbris to go XnpXnished. -Xst before he
departs to retXrn to Earth, they perform a mysterioXs neXrosXrgical
procedXre Xpon him. 2nly mXch later does he Xnderstand the natXre of his
pXnishment: the sXrgery makes it impossible for him to contain his
e[istential angst. 1ot only is he continXally bXffeted by the dread of sheer
contingency and his oZn inevitable death bXt he is doomed to isolation,
since anyone approaching Zithin hXndreds of feet is e[posed to the same
Zithering blasts of e[istential dread.

HoZever mXch I insisted to Irene that the black oo]e Zas a fiction, the trXth
is that I Zas often trapped in it. In my Zork Zith  Irene, I sXffered the fate of
those Zho approach too close to 3hilip Dick's protagonist: I Zas bXffeted by
my oZn e[istential  verities. Again and again oXr sessions confronted me
Zith my oZn  death. ThoXgh I alZays have knoZn that death is there
Zaiting, Zhirring  faintly  jXst beneath the membrane of my life, I had
generally managed to pXt it oXt of mind.

116
2f  coXrse, there are salXtary effects of dZelling Xpon death; I Xnderstand
that thoXgh the fact (the physicality) of death destroys Xs, the idea of death
may save Xs. This is old Zisdom: it is Zhy, for centXries, monks kept a skXll
in their cells, and Zhy 0ontaigne advised living  in a room Zith a vieZ of
the cemetery. 0y aZareness of death had long served to vitali]e my life,
helping me to triviali]e Zhat  is trivial and to valXe Zhat is trXly precioXs.
Yes, I kneZ these things intellectXally bXt I kneZ also that I coXld not live
constandy e[posed to the Zhite heat of death-terror.

So, in the past, I had generally pXt thoXghts of death on the back bXrner of
conscioXsness. BXt my Zork Zith Irene no longer permit that. Again and
again my hoXrs Zith her heightened not only my sensitivity' to death and
my sense of life's precioXsness, bXt also my death an[iety. 0ore times than
I can remember, I foXnd myself brooding over the fact that her hXsband Zas
stricken doZn at forty-five Zhile  I ZoXld never see si[ty again. I am in the
dying ]one, the rime of life Zhen I  coXld be e[tingXished at any moment.

Who ever said that therapists are overpaid?

116

/esson . 5eason versXs Treason

As oXr Zork proceeded into the third year, I greZ more and more
discoXraged. Therapy had hopelessly bogged doZn. So deeply mired in
depression Zas Irene that I coXld not bXdge her. 1or approach her: Zhen I
inTXired aboXt hoZ close or distant she felt in a session, she responded,
"0iles  and miles aZay—I can barely see yoX."

"Irene, I knoZ yoX may be tired of hearing this, bXt Ze absolXtely mXst
consider beginning an antidepressant. We've got to Xnderstand and resolve
Zhy yoX're so fi[ed in yoXr opposition to medication."

"We both knoZ Zhat medication means."

"2h?"

117
"It means yoX're TXitting, giving Xp on oXr therapy Zork. I am not looking
to be TXickly fi[ed."

"4Xickly  fi[ed,  Irene? Three years?"

"I mean, making me feel better is no solXtion. It only postpones dealing
Zith Zhat  I've lost."

1o matter Zhat argXments I Xsed, I coXld not dissXade her of these beliefs,
bXt eventXally she hXmored me by alloZing me to prescribe
antidepressants. The resXlt Zas the same as on oXr last trial tZo years
before. Three different drXgs Zere not only ineffective bXt resXlted in
Xnpleasant side effects: severe somnolence, alien and frightening dreams,
loss of all se[Xality and sensXality, a frightening sense of nothing mattering,
of being removed from herself and her concerns. When I sXggested that she
consXlt a psycho-pharmacologist , she flatly refXsed. Desperate, I finally
laid doZn an XltimatXm: "YoX mXst see the consXltant and folloZ his
recommendations or I

Zill  not continXe to Zork Zith yoX.

Irene looked at me Xnblinkingly. As XsXal, precise and constrained, she
gave nothing e[tra in speech or movement. "I'll consider it and give yoX my
ansZer ne[t session," she said.

BXt at oXr ne[t meeting, she did not respond directly to the XltimatXm.
Instead, she handed me an issXe of the 1eZ Yorkei; open to an article by
the 5Xssian poet -oseph Brodsky, entitled "2n Grief and 5eason."

"In this," she said, "yoX'll find the key to Zhat's gone Zrong in therapy. If
not, if yoX read it and find no ansZer, then I'll see yoXr consXltant."

3atients often ask me to read something of interest to them— some self-
help book, an article aboXt a neZ treatment or theory, a piece of literatXre
that strikes close to their oZn sitXation. 0ore than one Zriter-patient has
handed me a long manXscript saying, "YoX'll learn a great deal aboXt me by
reading this." This has ploy never proved valid: the patient coXld alZays
have delivered the material verbally in far less time. 1or do they Zant an

118
honest opinion of the Zriting from me—I generally loom too important to
the patient to have the freedom to offer an objective commentary.
2bvioXsly they seek something else; my approval and admiration—and a
therapist has far more direct and effective Zays of dealing Zith that need
than spending long hoXrs reading a manXscript. To sXch reTXests, I
generally search for a gracioXs Zay to decline—or, at most agree to a TXick
skim. I valXe my personal reading time and protect it staXnchly.

Yet I did not feel bXrdened as I began reading the article Irene had given
me. I had great respect not only for her taste bXt her clarity of mind; and, if
she believed this article contained the key to oXr impasse, I Zas confident
that the rime invested ZoXld be Zellspent. 2f coXrse, I ZoXld have
preferred more direct commXnication, bXt I Zas learning to be receptive to
Irene's obliTXe and often poetic mode of discoXrse—a langXage she had
learned from her mother. 8nlike her father, a paragon of lXcid rationality
Zho taXght science in a small midZestern high school, her mother, an

118

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

artist, commXnicated sXbtly. Irene learned aboXt her mother's moods
indirectly. 2n good days, for e[ample, her mother might say, "I think I'll pXt
some irises in the blXe and Zhite vase," or convey her mood by the Zay she
arranged the dolls on Irene's bed each morning.

The article opens Zith Brodsky's analysis of the first tZo verses of 5obert
Frost's poem "Come In."

As I came to the edge of the Zood

ThrXsh mXsic — hark!

1oZ  if it  Zas dXsk oXtside,

Inside, it Zas dark.

Too dark in the Zoods for a bird

119
By sleight of Zing

To better its perch for the night,

ThoXgh it still coXld sing.

"Come In" is, I had alZays thoXght, a lovely, and simple, natXre poem, one
I had memori]ed as an adolescent and recited aloXd Zhile bicycle riding
throXgh the 2ld Soldiers' Home in Washington, D.C. BXt here, in a brilliant
line-by-line, Zord-byZord  analysis, Brodsky Zas demonstrating that the
poem conveys a darker meaning. For e[ample, in the first stan]a, there is
something sinister in the thrXsh's (the poet, the bard himself) coming to the
edge of the Zoods and contemplating the dark interior. And doesn't the
second stan]a seem far more than a lyrical tXne? Indeed, Zhat does the poet
mean by saying that it is too dark in the Zoods for a poet by "sleight of
Zing" to better its perch for the night? Does "sleight of Zing" refer to
religioXs ritXal, perhaps last rites? Is Frost lamenting that it is too late, that
he is slated for damnation? And, indeed, later stan]as confirm that vieZ. In
short, Brodsky makes a poZerfXl case, not only for the poem's being a dark
poem indeed, bXt for Frost's being a far darker poet than many have
reali]ed.

I Zas fascinated. This discXssion illXminated Zhy this poem,

like manv of Frost's other deceptively simple Zorks, had so gripped me as a
yoXth. BXt the connection Zith Irene? The key to oXr problems in therapy
she had promised? I read on.

Brodsky ne[t tXrns to an analysis of a long narrative poem, the grim
pastoral "Home BXrial." The poem, set on a banistered stairZay in a small
farmhoXse, is a conversation, a series of movements, a ballet, betZeen a
farmer and his Zife. (I immediately thoXght, of coXrse, of Irene's parents,
Zho lived on a midZestern farm and also of the stairZay Zith banister that
Irene had descended almost three decades ago to ansZer the phone bringing
her the neZs of Allen's death.) The poem begins:

He saZ her from the bottom of the stairs Before she saZ him. She Zas
starting doZn /ooking  back over her shoXlder at some fear.

120
The farmer advances to his Zife, asking, "What is it yoX see/ from Xp there
alZays—for I Zant  to knoZ." AlthoXgh the Zife  is terrified and refXses to
ansZer, she is confident that he Zill never see Zhat she sees, and alloZs
him to moXnt the stairs. Coming to the Xpstairs ZindoZ, he stares oXt and
discovers Zhat she has been looking at. He is sXrprised he has never noticed
it before.

"The little graveyard Zhere my people are! So small the ZindoZ frames the
Zhole of it. 1ot  so mXch larger than a bedroom, is it? There are three stones
of slate and one of marble. Broad-shoXldered little slabs there in the
sXnlight 2n the sidehill. We haven *t to mind those. BXt I Xnderstand it is
not the stones, BXt the child's moXnd —" "Don't, don't, don't, don % " she
died.

With that, the Zife slips past him, goes doZnstairs and tXrns

120

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

him on "Zith  sXch a daXnting look," and heads for the front door. 3X]]led,
he asks, "Can't a man speak of his oZn child he's lost?"

"1ot  yoX!" she ansZers. 1or perhaps can any man, she adds, reaching for
her hat.

The farmer, asking to be alloZed into her grief, continXes Zith these
XnfortXnate Zords:

/ do think, thoXgh, yoX overdo it a little.

What Zas it broXght yoX Xp to think it the thing

To take yoXr mother-loss of a first child

So inconsolably — in the face of love.

YoX *d think his memory might be satisfied —

121
When his Zife remains aloof, he e[claims: "God, Zhat a Zoman! And it's
come to this: a man can speak of his oZn child that's dead."

His Zife responds that he doesn't knoZ hoZ to speak, that he has no
feelings. She had Zatched him throXgh her ZindoZ as he briskly dXg her
son's grave, "making the gravel leap and leap in air." And after finishing
digging, he had gone into the kitchen. She remembers:

"YoX coXld sit there Zith the stains on yoXr shoes 2f the fresh earth from
yoXr oZn baby s grave And talk aboXt yoXr everyday concerns. YoX had
stood the spade Xp against the Zall 2Xtside there in the entry, for I saZ it. "

The Zife insists that she Zon't have grief treated in this fashion. 1or let it
be lightly dismissed.

"1o, from  the time Zhen one is sick to death 2ne is alone, and he dies more
alone. Friends make pretmse of folloZing to the grave, BXt before one is in
it, their minds are tXrned

And making the best of their Zay back to life And living people and things
they Xnderstand. BXt the Zorlds evil. I Zon H have grief so If I can change
it. 2h, I  Zon % I Zon  '?/"

The hXsband responds patroni]ingly that he knoZs she Zill feel better for
having said these things. It's time to end grief, he sXggests. "YoXr heart's
gone oXt of it: Why keep it Xp."

The poem ends Zith the Zife's opening the door to leave. Her hXsband tries
to block her:

"Where do yoX mean to go? First tell me that. 9 11 folloZ and bring yoX
back by force. I Zill!  —"

Enthralled, I read the piece straight throXgh and, at the end I had to remind
myself of the reason I Zas reading it. In seeking Zhat key to Irene's inner
life it might hold, I  thoXght first of her initial dream in Zhich she has to
read an earlier te[t before she can read the contemporary one. 2bvioXsly Ze
had more Zork to do on Irene's loss of her brother. I had already learned

122
that his death had set off, domino-fashion, many other losses. Her home
Zas never the same: her mother never recovered from her son's death and
remained chronically depressed; her parents' relationship Zas never again
harmonioXs.

3erhaps the poem Zas a stark portrayal of Zhat mXst have gone on in
Irene's home after her brother's death, especially the parental clash, as her
father and mother each dealt Zith their loss in diametrically opposed Zays.
This is not Xncommon after the death of a child: hXsband and Zife grieve in
different fashions (characteristically folloZing gender stereotypes: more
often than not, the female grieves openly and emotively, Zhile the male
deals Zith grief throXgh repression and active diversion). For many coXples,
each of these tZo patterns actively interferes Zith the other—that is
precisely the reason so many marriages break Xp after the loss of a child.

122

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

I thoXght of Irene's connection to other images in Frost's "Home BXrial."
The changing vieZs of the bXrial plot's si]e Zas a brilliant metaphor: to the
farmer it Zas both the si]e of the bedroom and so small it Zas framed by
the ZindoZ; to the mother, it Zas so large she coXld see nothing else. And
the ZindoZs. Irene Zas draZn to ZindoZs.  "I'd like to live  oXt my life in a
high rise apartment staring oXt the ZindoZ," she said once. 2r she imagined
moving to a large seaside 9ictorian hoXse Zhere "I'd divide my time there
betZeen staring throXgh the ZindoZ at the ocean or pacing the rooftop
ZidoZ's Zalk  forever."

The farmer's Zife's bitter dismissal of friends Zho, after visiting the grave
briefly, immediately make their Zay back to their everyday lives had been a
familiar theme of Irene's in therapy. 2nce, to make this point more graphic,
Irene had broXght in a print of 3ieter BrXeghel's Fall of IcarXs. "/ook at
these peasants," she said, "Zorking aZay, not bothering to look Xp at the
boy falling from the sky." She had even broXght in AXden's poetic
description of the painting:

123
In BrXeghel's IcarXs, for instance: hoZ everything tXrns aZay 4Xite
leisXrely from the disaster; the ploXghman may Have heard the splash, the
forsaken cry, BXt for him it Zas not an important failXre; the sXn shone As
it had to on the Zhite legs disappearing into the green Water; and the
e[pensive delicate ship that mXst have seen Something ama]ing, a boy
falling oXt of the sky, Had someZhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

2ther aspects of Irene in Frost's "Home BXrial"? The mother's clinging to
grief and the father's matter-of-factness and impatience Zith her for not
letting it go: that, too, I had heard her describe in her oZn family.

BXt these observations, hoZever graphic and informative, did not
sXfficiently e[plain Zhy  Irene had placed sXch importance on my reading
the article. "The key to Zhat has gone Zrong in ther-

apv:" those Zere her Zords, her promise. I felt let doZn. 3erhaps I've
overestimated her, I thoXght; for once, she has missed the mark.

At oXr ne[t session Irene entered the office and, as XsXal, marched past me
to her chair ZithoXt looking at me. She settled in, placed her pXrse on the
floor ne[t  to her, then—instead of staring oXt the ZindoZ in silence for a
feZ moments as she XsXally did—she tXrned immediately to me and asked,
"YoX read the article?"

"Yes, I did and it's a marveloXs piece. Thanks for giving it to me."

"And?" she prodded.

"And it Zas gripping;  I've heard yoX talk aboXt yoXr parents' life after
Allen's death, bXt the poem broXght it home to me Zith e[traordinary
intensity. I Xnderstand noZ so mXch more clearly Zhy yoX coXld never
retXrn to live Zith them again and hoZ closely yoX identified Zith yoXr
mother's Zay and her strXggle Zith her father and—"

I coXldn't continXe. The e[pression of groZing disbelief on Irene's face
stopped me cold. Her astonished stare Zas that of a teacher facing some
dXnderhead of a pXpil as she Zondered hoZ he coXld ever have been
promoted to her class.

124
Finally, throXgh clenched teeth, Irene hissed, "The farmer and the Zife in
that poem are not my mother and my father. They're Xs — yoX and me."
She paXsed, caXght herself, and a moment later added in a softer voice, "I
mean they may have characteristics of my parents bXt essentially the farmer
and his Zife are yoX and me in this room."

0y  head reeled. 2f coXrse! 2f coXrse! InstantaneoXsly, every line of
"Home BXrial" took on neZ meaning. I scrambled fXrioXsly. 1ever before
or since has my mind Zorked more TXickly.

"So it is /Zho brings the dirty shovel into the hoXse?"

Irene nodded briskly.

"And / Zho enter the kitchen Zith mXddy grave-stained shoes?"

Irene nodded again. 1ot Xncharitably, this time. 3erhaps my TXick recovery
ZoXld redeem me yet.

124

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

"And / Zho chide yoX for clinging to grief? Who say yoX overdo it, Zho ask
'Why keep it Xp, Zhen his memory mXst be satisfied by noZ?' / Zho dig the
grave so briskly that the gravel leaps into the air? / Zhose Zords continXally
give offense? And it is I Zho try to force himself betZeen yoX and yoXr
grief? And certainly / Zho block yoX at the door and try to force grief
medicine doZn yoXr throat?"

Irene nodded, as tears gathered in her eyes and rolled doZn her cheeks. It
Zas the first time in her three years of despair that she Zept openly in my
presence. I handed her a tissXe. And took one for myself. She reached oXt
for my hand. We Zere back together again.

HoZ had Ze groZn so far apart? /ooking  back, I see Ze had a fXndamental
clash of sensibilities: I, an e[istential rationalist; she, grief-stricken
romantic. 3erhaps the rift Zas Xnavoidable; perhaps oXr modes of coping

125
Zith tragedy Zere intrinsically  opposed. HoZ does one best face the brXtal
e[istential facts of life? I believe that, at bottom, Irene felt that there Zere
only tZo, eTXally Xnpalatable, strategies: to adopt some form of denial or to
live in intolerably an[ioXs aZareness. Wasn't Cervantes voicing this
dilemma throXgh his immortal Don's TXestion, "Which Zill yoX have: Zise
madness or foolish sanity?"

I have a bias that poZerfXlly affects my therapeXtic approach. I have never
believed that aZareness leads to madness, nor denial to sanity. I have long
regarded denial as the enemy, and I challenge it Zhenever possible in my
therapy and my personal life. 1ot only have I have attempted to shed all
personal illXsions that narroZ my vision and foster smallness and
dependency, bXt I encoXrage my patients to do the same. I am persXaded
that Zhile honest confrontation Zith one's e[istential sitXation may evoke
fear and trembling, it is Xltimately healing and enriching. 0y
psychotherapeXtic approach is thXs epitomi]ed by Thomas Hardy's
comment, "If a Zay to the Better there be, it e[acts a fXll look at the Worst."

From the very beginning of therapy, I spoke to Irene Zith the voice of
reason. I encoXraged her to rehearse Zith me the events

sXrroXnding and folloZing her hXsband's death:

"HoZ Zill   yoX learn of his death?

"Will  yoX be Zith him Zhen he dies?

"What Zill  yoX feel?

"Whom Zill  yoX call?"

And in the same Zay she and I rehearsed his fXneral. I told her that I ZoXld
attend the fXneral and that if her friends ZoXld not linger Zith her at the
graveside, I ZoXld be sXre to do so. If others Zere too frightened to hear her
macabre thoXghts, I ZoXld encoXrage her to speak them to me. I tried to
take the terror oXt of her nightmares.

126
Whenever she moved into irrational realms, I coXld be coXnted on to
confront her. Consider, for e[ample, her gXilt for enjoying herself Zith
another man. She considered any life enjoyment a betrayal of -ack. If she
Zent Zith  a man to a beach or a restaXrant she and -ack had once visited,
she felt she Zas betraying him by violating the specialness of their love. 2n
the other hand, going to a brand-neZ spot elicited sXrvivor gXilt: "Why
shoXld I be alive and enjoying neZ e[periences Zhen -ack is dead?" She
also felt gXilty for not having been a good-enoXgh Zife. As a resXlt of
psychotherapy, she XnderZent many changes: she became softer, more
considerate and affectionate. "HoZ Xnfair to -ack," she said, "that I shoXld
be able to give more of myself to another man than to him."

Again and again, I challenged sXch statements. "Where is -ack noZ?" I
asked. She alZays ansZered, "1oZhere—e[cept in memory"—in her
memory and in the memory of others. She had no religioXs beliefs and
never posited the persistence of conscioXsness, or any other form of
afterlife. So I pestered her Zith reason: "If he is not sentient and does not
observe yoXr actions, hoZ then can he be hXrt by yoXr being Zith another
man? Besides, I reminded her, -ack had, before he died, e[plicitly e[pressed
his Zishes for her to be happy and to remarry. "WoXld he Zant yoX, and his
daXghter, to droZn in sorroZ? So, even if his conscioXsness did still e[ist,
he ZoXld not feel betrayed; he'd be pleased by yoXr recovery." And either
Zay, I'd Zind Xp, no matter Zhether

126

Seven Advanced /essons in ike Therapy of Grief

-ack's conscioXsness sXrvives or does not sXrvive, "Xnfairness" and
"betrayal" have no meaning.

At times Irene had vivid dreams of -ack's being alive—a common
phenomenon in bereavement—only to aZaken Zith a thXd to reali]e it Zas
bXt a dream. 2ther times she ZoXld Zeep bitterly aboXt his being "oXt
there" sXffering. Sometimes Zhen she visited the cemetery, she Zept at the
"aZfXl thoXght" of his being there locked in a cold casket. She dreamed of
opening her free]er and finding a miniatXre -ack, his eyes Zide open,
staring at her. 0ethodically and relendessly, I ZoXld remind her of her

127
belief that he Zasn't oXt there, that he no longer e[isted as a sentient being.
And reminded her as Zell of her Zish that he coXld observe her. In my
e[perience, even* bereaved spoXse sXffers from feeling that his or her life is
Xnobserved.

Irene held on to many of -ack's personal effects, often rXmmaging throXgh
the contents of his desk draZers for some memento of him Zhenever she
needed a birthday present for one of her children. So sXrroXnded Zas she by
material reminders of -ack that I Zorried Irene ZoXld become like 0iss
Haversham in Dickens's Great E[pectations, a Zoman so caXght Xp in grief
(for having been deserted at the altar) that she lives for years in the cobZebs
of loss, never taking off her Zedding dress or clearing off the table set for
her Zedding feast. Hence, throXghoXt therapy, I Xrged Irene to tXrn aZay
from the past, to rejoin life, to loosen her ties Zith -ack: Take doZn some of
yoXr photos of him. 5edecorate yoXr home. BXy a neZ bed. Clean oXt the
desk draZers, throZ things aZay. Travel someZhere neZ. Do something
yoX've never done before. Stop talking so mXch to -ack.

BXt Zhat I called reason, Irene called treason. What I called rejoining life,
she called betrayal of love. What I called detachment from the dead, she
called abandonment of her love.

I thoXght I Zas being the rationalist she needed; she thoXght I Zas pollXting
the pXrity of her grief. I thoXght I Zas leading her back into life; she
thoXght I Zas forcing her to tXrn her back on -ack. I thoXght I Zas
inspiriting her to become the e[istential

hero; she thoXght I Zas a self-satisfied spectator Zatching her tragedy from
a safe grandstand seat.

I Zas stXnned by her obstinacy. Why can't she get it? That -ack is really
dead, that his conscioXsness is e[tingXished? That it isn't her faXlt? That she
is not jin[ed, that she Zill  not caXse my death or the death of the ne[t man
she loves? That she is not fated to e[perience tragedy forever? That she is
clinging to crooked beliefs becaXse she so fears the alternative: recogni]ing
that she lives in a Xniverse absolXtely indifferent to Zhether she is happy or
Xnhappy.

128
And she Zondered at my obtXseness. Why can't Irv get it? Why doesn't he
see that he is defacing my memory of -ack, defiling my grief by tracking in
grave mXd and leaving the shovel in the kitchen? Why can't he Xnderstand
that I jXst Zanted to look oXt the ZindoZ at -ack's grave? That it infXriates
me Zhen he tries to yank me aZay from my heart? That there are times
Zhen, despite my need for him, I absolXtely have to get aZay from him,
sTXee]e by him on the stairs, breathe fresh air. That I'm droZning, I'm
clinging to the Zreckage of my life, and he keeps trying to pry my fingers
aZay? Why can't he get it that -ack died becaXse of my poisoned love?

That evening, as I revieZed the session in my mind, another patient Zhom I
had seen decades earlier came into my mind. ThroXghoXt adolescence she
had been locked in a long bitter strXggle Zith her nay-saying father. When
she left home for the first time, he drove her to college and, in typical
fashion, rXined the trip by groXsing the entire time aboXt the Xgly, garbage-
littered stream by the side of the road. She, on the other hand, saZ only a
beaXtifXl, rXstic Xnspoiled creek. Years later, after he died, she chanced to
make the trip again and noted that there Zere tZo streams, one on each side
of the road. "BXt this time I Zas the driver," she said sadly, "and the stream
I saZ throXgh the driver's ZindoZ Zas jXst as Xgly and pollXted as my
father had described it."

All the components of this lesson—my impasse Zith Irene, her insistence
that I read Frost's poem, my recollection of my patient's

128

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

story of the aXtomobile ride—had been deeply instrXctive. With astonishing
clarity, I Xnderstood noZ that it Zas time for me to listen, to set aside my
personal Zorld vieZ, to stop imposing my style and my vieZs Xpon my
patient. It Zas time to look oXt of Irene's ZindoZ.

/esson 6. 1ever Sena to .noZ  for Zhom  the Bell Tolls

2ne day, in the foXrth year of therapy, Irene arrived carrying a large
portfolio. She pXt it on the floor, sloZly XnbXckled it, and pXlled oXt a big

129
canvas, keeping its back toZard me, so I coXldn't see it.

"Did I tell  yoX that I Zas taking art lessons?" she asked in an
Xncharacteristically playfXl manner.

"1o. First I've  heard of it. BXt I think that's great."

And I did. I took no Xmbrage that she mentioned it m passant; every
therapist is Xsed to patients' forgetting to mention the good things in their
lives. 3erhaps it's simply a misXnderstanding, a mistaken assXmption by
patients that, since therapy is pathology-oriented, therapists Zant only to
hear aboXt problems. 2ther patients, hoZever, Zho are dependent Xpon
therapy, choose to conceal positive developments lest their therapists
conclXde that they no longer need help.

1oZ, taking a breath, Irene flipped the canvas. Before me gleamed a still-
life, a simple Zooden boZl containing a lemon, orange and avocado. While
impressed Zith her graphic skills, I felt disappointed in her sXbject matter,
so flat and pointless. I ZoXld have hoped for something more relevant to
oXr Zork. BXt I feigned interest and Zas convincingly enthXsiastic in my
praise.

1ot as convincing as I had thoXght, I soon learned. The ne[t session she
annoXnced:

"I'm signing Xp for another si[ months of art lessons."

"That's ZonderfXl. Same teacher?"

"Yes, same teacher, same class."

"YoX mean a still-life class?"

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

"YoX're hoping not, I think. 2bvioXsly there's something yoX're not
sharing."

"/ike  Zhat?" I  began to feel Xncomfortable. "What's yoXr hXnch?"

130
"I see I've hit on something." Irene grinned. "Almost never do yoX fall back
on the traditional shrink practice of ansZering a TXestion Zith a TXestion."

"1ever miss a trick, Irene. 2kay, the trXth is that I had tZo very different
feelings aboXt the painting." Here I invoked a practice I alZays teach my
stXdents. When tZo opposing feelings pXt yoX in a dilemma, yoXr best
recoXrse is to e[press both feelings and the dilemma. "First, as I said, I
admired it gready. I absolXtely have no artistic talent and am filled Zith
respect for Zork of sXch TXality." I hesitated, and Irene nXdged me:

"BXt—"

"BXt—Zell—Xh—I'm  so pleased Zith yoXr finding pleasXre in painting that
I dread soXnding even slighdy critical, bXt I gXess I Zas hoping that yoX
might do something Zith yoXr art that might be more—Xh—hoZ to pXt it?
— resonant Zith oXr therapy."

"5esonant?"

"2ne thing I  like aboXt oXr Zork together is that yoX invariably respond
Zith sXbstance Zhenever I ask aboXt Zhat's passing throXgh yoXr mind.
Sometimes it's a thoXght, bXt even more commonly yoX describe some
mental image. With yoXr e[traordinary visXal sense, I Zas hoping yoX coXld
combine yoXr art and therapy in some synergistic manner. I don't knoZ—
possibly I Zas hoping the painting might be more e[pressionistic, or
cathartic, or illXminating. 0aybe yoX coXld even Zork throXgh some
painfXl issXes on canvas. BXt the still life, Zhile technically ZonderfXl, is
so, so—serene, so far removed from conflict and pain."

Seeing Irene's eyes rolling Xp, I added, "YoX asked for my feelings, and
there they are. I'm not defending them. In fact, I sXspect I'm making a
mistake by being critical of any activity that provides yoX an interlXde of
peace."

"Irv, I don't think yoX knoZ mXch aboXt painting. Do yoX

knoZ Zhat the French call a still-life?"

131
I shook my head.

"1atXre morte."

"Dead natXre."

"5ight. To paint a still-life  is to meditate on death and decay. When I paint
frXit, I can't avoid observing hoZ my still life models are dying and
decomposing day after day. When I paint I am very close to oXr therapy,
pointedly aZare of -ack's passage from life into dXst, very aZare of the
presence of death and the smell of decay in everything that lives."

"Everything?" I ventXred.

She nodded.

"YoX? 0e?"

"Everything," she replied. "Especially me."

At last! I had been scratching for Irene's last statement, or something like it,
since the very beginning of oXr Zork. It heralded a neZ phase in therapy, as
I recogni]ed from the strong dream she broXght in a coXple of Zeeks later.

"I am sitting at a table—like an e[ecXtive board table. There are others
there as Zell and yoX are sitting at the head of the table. We are all Zorking
on something—perhaps revieZing grant proposals. YoX ask me to bring
some papers to yoX. It is a small room, and to get to yoX I have to pass very
close to a roZ of ZindoZs that are open and reach all the Zay to the floor. I
coXld easily fall oXt the Zindo,Z and I Zoke Xp Zith a poZerfXl thoXght in
my mind: HoZ coXld yoX have e[posed me to sXch great danger?"

This general theme— her being in danger and my failing to pro-tea her —
soon gathered steam. A feZ nights later, she had tZo companion dreams,
one folloZing immediately Xpon the heels of the other. (Companion dreams
may convey the same message. 2Xr friend, the dream-Zriting homXncXlXs,
often amXses himself by composing different variations on a particXlarly
arresting theme.)

132
132

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

The first:

YoX are the leader of a groXp. Something dangeroXs is aboXt to happen—
I'm not sXre Zhat: bXt yoX are leading the groXp into the Zoods to some
safer spot. 2r yoX are sXpposed to be. BXt the trail yoX take Xs on gets
rockier, narroZer, darker. Then it disappears entirely. YoX vanish, and Ze
are lost and very scared.

The second:

We—the same groXp—are all in a hotel room; and again there is some
danger. 0aybe intrXders, maybe a tornado. Again, yoX are leading Xs oXt of
danger. YoX take Xs Xp a fire escape Zhich has black metal steps. We climb
and climb, bXt it goes noZhere. It jXst ends at the ceiling, and Ze all have to
back doZn.

2ther dreams folloZed. In one, she and I take an e[am together, and neither
of Xs knoZs the ansZer. In another, she looks at herself in the mirror and
sees red spots of decay on her cheeks. In another, she dances Zith a Ziry
yoXng man, Zho sXddenly leaves her on the dance floor. She tXrns to a
mirror and recoils to see her face covered Zith sagging red skin
pockmarked Zith hideoXs boils and blood blisters.

The message of these dreams Zas crystal-clear: danger and decay are
inescapable. And I am no savior—on the contrary, I am Xnreliable and
impotent. Soon a particXlarly poZerfXl dream added a fXrther component.

YoX are my travel gXide in an isolated site in a foreign coXntry— maybe
Greece or TXrkey YoX are driving an open -eep, and Ze are TXarreling
aboXt Zhat to visit. I Zanted to see some beaXtifXl old classical rXins, and
yoX keep Zanting to take me to the modern, tacky, flimsy city. YoX begin to
drive so fast that I get scared. Then the -eep gets stXck, and Ze are tottering,
sZaying back and forth, over some hXge pit. I look doZn and can't see the
bottom.

133
This dream, involving the dichotomy betZeen beaXtifXl ancient rXins and a
modern tacky city reflects, of coXrse, oXr ongoing "treason versXs reason"
debate. Which roXte to take? The old beaXtifXl rXins (the first te[t) of her
old life? 2r  the deplorably Xgly neZ life she saZ stretching ahead of her?
BXt it aiso sXggested a neZ aspect of oXr Zork together. In the earlier
dreams I am inept: I lose the path in the forest, I take Irene Xp a fire escape
that leads to a ceiling Zith no escape, I do not knoZ the ansZers to the
e[amination. In this dream, hoZever, not only am I inept and fail to protect
her: lam also dangeroXs —I lead Irene to the brink of death.

A coXple of nights later, she dreamed that she and I embrace and gently
kiss. BXt Zhat started off sZeetly tXrns to terror Zhen my moXth opens
Zider and Zider and I begin to devoXr her. "I strXggle and strXggle," she
reported, "bXt cannot Zrench free."

"1ever send to knoZ for Zhom  the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." ThXs, as
-ohn Donne observed nearly foXr hXndred years ago in these noZ familiar
lines, the fXneral bell tolls not only for the dead bXt also for yoX and me—
sXrvivors, yes, bXt for a limited time. This insight is as old as history. FoXr
thoXsand years ago in a Babylonian epic, Gilgamesh reali]ed that the death
of his friend, EnkidX, foreshadoZed his oZn: "EnkidX has become dark and
cannot hear me. When I die shall I not be like Xnto EnkidX? SorroZ enters
my heart. I am afraid of death."

The death of the other confronts Xs Zith oXr oZn death. Is this a good
thing? ShoXld sXch a confrontation be encoXraged in the psychotherapy of
grief? 4Xestion: Why scratch Zhere it doesn't itch? Why fan the flame of
death an[iety in bereaved individXals already boZed loZ by loss? AnsZer:
BecaXse the confrontation Zith ones death may generate positive personal
change.

0y  first aZareness of the therapeXtic potential of an encoXnter Zith death
in the therapy of grief occXrred decades ago Zhen a si[ty-year-old man
described to me the terrible nightmare he had had the night after learning
that his Zife's cervical cancer had dangeroXsly metastasi]ed and Zas no
longer treatable. In the nightmare, he's rXnning throXgh an old deteriorating
hoXse— broken

134
134

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

ZindoZs, crXmbling riles, leaking roof—pXrsXed by a Frankenstein
monster. He defends himself, he hits, he kicks, he stabs, he throZs the
monster off the roof. BXt—and this is the central message of the dream—
the monster is Xnstoppable: it instantly reappears and continXes the pXrsXit.
The monster is no stranger to him, having first invaded his dreams Zhen he
Zas a boy of ten, shortly after his father's fXneral. It terrori]ed him for
months and eventXally vanished, only to reappear fifty years later at the
neZs of his Zife's fatal illness. When I asked for his thoXghts aboXt the
dream, his first Zords Zere: "I've got a hXndred thoXsand miles on me, as
Zell."  I Xnderstood then that the death of the other—first of his father and
noZ the impending one of his Zife—confronted him Zith  his oZn. The
Frankenstein monster Zas a personification of death, and the deteriorated
hoXse signified his bodily aging and deterioration.

With that intervieZ I  believed I had discovered a ZonderfXl neZ concept
Zith significant  implications for the psychotherapy of grief. Soon I began to
look for this theme in every bereaved patient; and it Zas to test this
hypothesis that, a feZ years prior to my seeing Irene, a colleagXe and I,
0orton  /ieberman, embarked on oXr research project in bereavement.

2f  the eighty bereaved spoXses 0orton /ieberman and I stXdied, a
significant proportion—Xp to one third—reported a heightened aZareness
of their oZn mortality;  and that aZareness Zas, in tXrn, significantly related
to a sXrge of Xne[pected personal groZth. Where retXrn to a previoXs level
of fXnctioning is generally considered to be the end point of bereavement,
oXr data sXggested that some ZidoZs and ZidoZers do more than that: as a
resXlt of an e[istential confrontation, they become more matXre, more
aZare, Ziser.

/ong  before psychology e[isted as an independent discipline, the great
Zriters Zere the great psychologists, and there are in literatXre rich
e[amples of death aZareness cataly]ing personal transformation. Consider
Ebene]er Scrooge's e[istential shock therapy in Dickens's Christmas Carol.
Scrooge's astonishing personal change resXlts not from YXletide cheer, bXt

135
from his being forced to confront his oZn death. Dickens's messenger (the
Ghost of Christmas

Yet To Come) Xses a poZerfXl e[istential shock therapy: the ghost takes
Scrooge into the fXtXre, Zhere he observes his final hoXrs, overhears others
lightly dismiss his death, and sees strangers TXarreling over his material
possessions. Scrooge's transformation occXrs immediately after the scene
Zhere he kneels in the chXrchyard and toXches the letters on his oZn
tombstone.

2r consider Tolstoy's 3ierre, a lost soXl Zho stXmbles aimlessly throXgh the
first nine hXndred pages of War and 3eace Xntil he is captXred by
1apoleon's troops, Zatches the five men in line ahead of him be e[ecXted
by firing sTXad, and then received a last-minXte reprieve. This near-death
transforms 3ierre, Zho marches throXgh the final three hXndred pages Zith
]est, pXrpose, and a keen appreciation of life's precioXsness. Even more
remarkable is Tolstoy's Ivan Ilych, the mean-spirited bXreaXcrat Zhose
agony, as he lies dying from abdominal cancer, is relieved by the stXnning
insight: "/ am dying so badly becaXse I have lived so badly." In the feZ days
of life remaining to him, Ivan Ilych  Xndergoes an e[traordinary inner
change, achieving a degree of generosity, empathy, and integration that he
had never before knoZn.

ThXs, the horror of facing imminent death, can propell one into Zisdom and
a depth of being. I have rXn many groXps of dying patients Zho Zelcomed
stXdent observers becaXse they felt they had mXch to teach aboXt life. What
a pity, I have heard these patients say, that "Ze had to Zait till noZ, till oXr
bodies Zere riddled Zith cancer to knoZ hoZ to live."  ElseZhere, in the
memoir, "Travels Zith 3aXla," I describe a nXmber of individXals facing
terminal cancer, Zho greZ in Zisdom as they confronted their death.

BXt Zhat aboXt everyday, physically healthy patients in contemporary
psychotherapy—men and Zomen not facing terminal illness or a firing
sTXad? HoZ can Ze clinicians e[pose them to the trXth of their e[istential
sitXation? I try to take advantage of certain Xrgent sitXations, often termed
"boXndary e[periences," Zhich offer a ZindoZ into  deeper e[istential
levels. 2bvioXsly facing one's oZn death is the most poZerfXl boXndary
e[perience, bXt there are many others—serioXs illness or injXry, divorce,

136
136

career failXre, milestones (retirement, children leaving home, mid-life,
important birthdays), and, of coXrse, the very compelling e[perience of the
death of a significant other.

Accordingly, my original strategy in therapy Zith Irene Zas to Xse the
leverage of e[istential confrontation Zhenever possible. Again and again I
attempted to tXrn her attention from -ack's death to her oZn life and death.
When she spoke, for e[ample, of living only for her daXghter, of Zelcoming
death, of spending her remaining life ga]ing oXt of the ZindoZ at the
family bXrial plot, I ZoXld refle[iveiy   say, "BXt aren't yoX then choosing to
sTXander yoXr life—the only life yoX'll ever have?"

After -ack's death, Irene often had dreams in Zhich some calamity—often a
firestorm—engXlfs her entire family. She vieZed these dreams as reflecting
-ack's death and the end of their intact family. "1o, no, yoX're overlooking
something," I'd respond. "This dream is not only aboXt -ack and the family
—it's also a dream aboXt yoXr oZn death."

DXring the first years, Irene promptly dismissed sXch comments. "YoX don't
Xnderstand. I've had too mXch loss, too mXch traXma, too many deaths
stacked Xp." 5espite from pain Zas her TXest, and the idea of death seemed
more solXtion than threat. That is not an Xncommon position: many
distressed people consider death a magical place of peace. BXt death is not a
state of peace, nor is it a state in Zhich one continXes life ZithoXt pain; it is
conscioXsness e[tingXished.

3erhaps I Zas not respectfXl of her timing. 3erhaps I made the error, as I
often do, of leaping in ahead of my patient. 2r perhaps Irene Zas simply
someone Zho coXld not profit from confronting her e[istential sitXation. At
any rate, finding I Zas getting noZhere, I eventXally abandoned this tack
and soXght other Zays to help her. Then, months later, Zhen I least
e[pected it, came the episode of the still-life painting, folloZed by the
cascade of images and dreams perfXsed Zith death an[iety.

137
1oZ  the timing Zas right, and she Zas receptive to my interpretations.
Another dream appeared, one so arresting she coXld

not banish it from her mind.

I am in the screened porch of a flimsy sXmmer cottage and see a large
menacing beast Zith an enormoXs moXth Zaiting a feZ feet from the front
door. I am terrified. I Zorry something Zill  happen to my daXghter. I decide
to try to satisfy the beast Zith a sacrifice and toss a red plaid stXffed animal
oXt of the door. The beast takes the bait bXt stays there. Its eyes bXrn. They
are fi[aed on me. I am the prey.

Irene immediately identified the stXffed sacrificial animal: "It's -ack. That's
the color of his pajamas the night he died." So strong Zas the dream it
remained in her mind for Zeeks. She gradXally began to reali]e that, thoXgh
she had first displaced onto her daXghter her an[iety aboXt her oZn death,
she Zas really its prey. "It's me the creatXre is looking at so fiercely, and
that means there is only one Zay to Xnderstand this dream." She hesitated.
"The dream is saying that I've XnconscioXsly vieZed -ack's death as a
sacrifice so that I might continXe living." She Zas shocked at her oZn
thoXght and even more by the reali]ation that death Zas oXt there Zaiting,
not for others, not for her daXghter, bXt for her. "I am its prey."

8sing this neZ frame of reference, Ze gradXally re-e[amined some of
Irene's most persistent and painfXl feelings. We began Zith gXilt, Zhich
tormented her, as it does most bereaved spoXses. I once treated a ZidoZ
Zho had rarely left the bedside of her hXsband for Zeeks as he lay
XnconscioXs in a hospital. 2ne day, in the feZ minXtes it took her to slip
doZn to the hospital gift shop to pXrchase a neZspaper, her hXsband died.
GXilt for having deserted him plagXed her for months. Irene, similarly, had
been ine[haXstible in her attentiveness to -ack: she nXrsed him Zith
e[traordinary devotion and rejected all of my Xrgings to take time off, to
give herself some respite by hospitali]ing him or engaging a nXrsing
service. Instead, she placed a hospital bed for him ne[t to her bed and slept
by him Xntil the moment he died. Still, she coXld not shake the idea that she
shoXld have done more: "I

138

138
Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

shoXld never have left his side. I shoXld have been gentler, more
affectionate, more intimate."

3erhaps gXilt is a Zay of denying death," I Xrged. "3erhaps the sXbte[t of
yoXr 'I shoXld have done more,' is that, if yoX had done things differently,
yoX coXld have prevejited his death. "

3erhaps, too, death-denial Zas the sXbte[t of many of her other irrational
beliefs: that she Zas the singXlar caXse of the death of all those Zho had
loved her; that she Zas jin[ed, a black, to[ic, deadly aXra emanating from
her; that she Zas evil, cXrsed, even her love Zas lethal; that she Zas being
pXnished by someone, by something, for some Xnforgivable offense.
3erhaps all these beliefs served to obscXre the brXtal facts of life. If she
Zere in fact jin[ed  or responsible for deaths, it ZoXld folloZ that death is
not inevitable, that it has a hXman, avoidable caXse; that e[istence Zas not
capricioXs, that each individXal is not throZn, alone, into e[istence, that
there is an overarching, thoXgh incomprehensible, cosmic pattern; and that
the Xniverse oversees and jXdges Xs.

In time, Irene Zas able to converse more openly aboXt e[istence fear and to
reformXlate the reasons behind her refXsal to make neZ attachments to
others, especially to men. She had claimed that she avoided engagement,
inclXding engagement Zith me, to avoid the pain of another loss. 1oZ she
began to apprehend that it Zas not jXst the loss of the other she dreaded, bXt
all reminders of life's transience.

I introdXced Irene to some of 2tto 5ank's vieZs on the life-phobic
individXal. In Zriting  that "some individXals refXse the loan of life in order
to avoid the debt of death," 5ank, an e[isten-tially aZare disciple of FreXd,
Zas describing Irene's dilemma precisely. "/ook at the Zay yoX refXse the
loan of life," I chided her, "looking endlessly oXt the ZindoZ, avoiding
passion, avoiding engagement, immersing yoXrself in -ack's memorabilia.
Don't take an ocean voyage," I advised, "YoXr reasoning ZoXld render the
trip joyless. Why invest yoXrself in anything, Zhy make friends, Zhy take
an interest in anyone, if the voyage is to end?" Irene's increased Zillingness
to accept her oZn limited e[is-

139
tence presaged many changes. Where she had once spoken of a secret
society of people Zho lived thoXgh the death of someone they loved, noZ
she proposed a second, overlapping society composed of those enlightened
individXals Zho are, as she pXt it, "aZare of their destination."

2f  all her changes , the most Zelcome change Zas her increased
Zillingness to engage me. I had been important to Irene. I had no doXbt
aboXt that: there Zere months Zhen she said she lived only for oXr visits.
And yet, close as Ze Zere, I had alZays thoXght that she and I met only
obliTXely, that Ze had alZays missed a trXe "I-ThoX" encoXnter. She had
tried, as she pXt it earlier in therapy, to keep me oXtside of time, to knoZ as
little as possible aboXt me, to pretend I had no life narrative Zith a
beginning and an end. 1oZ that changed.

At the beginning of therapy, on a visit to her parents, Irene had come Xpon
an old illXstrated Frank BaXm 2] book she had read as a child. 2n her
retXrn she had told me that I had an Xncanny resemblance to the Wi]ard of
2].  1oZ,  after three years of therapy, she looked again at the illXstration
and foXnd the resemblance less striking. I sensed something important Zas
happening Zhen she mXsed, "0aybe yoX're not the Zi]ard. 0aybe there is
no Zi]ard.  3erhaps," she Zent on, more to herself than to me, "I shoXld
simply accept yoXr idea that yoX and I are jXst felloZ travelers thoroXgh this
life, both of Xs listening to the bell tolling."

And I had no doXbt that a neZ phase of therapy Zas beginning one
afternoon in oXr foXrth year Zhen she came into my office looking straight
at me, sat doZn, looked at me again, and said, "It's strange, Irv, bXt yoX
seem to have gotten a lot smaller."

140

2Xr final session Zas Xnremarkable e[cept for tZo events. Irene had to
phone to inTXire aboXt its time. ThoXgh oXr meeting time often changed
becaXse of her sXrgical schedXle, she had not once, in five years, forgotten
it. I, for my part, developed a splitting headache jXst before the session.
Since I almost never get headaches, I sXspect that this one Zas in some Zay

140
related to -ack's brain tXmor Zhich first made its presence knoZn via a
severe headache.

"I've been Zondering aboXt something all Zeek," Irene said to start Zith.
"Do yoX plan to Zrite aboXt any aspect of oXr Zork together."

I had not thoXght of Zriting aboXt her and, at that time, Zas immersed in
planning a novel. I told her this, adding, "And, anyZay, I've never Zritten
aboXt therapy as cXrrent as oXrs. In /ove 's E[ecXtioner, I had XsXally
Zaited years, sometimes a decade or more, after a particXlar patient's
therapy ended before Zriting aboXt it. And, let me reassXre yoX, if I ever did
consider Zriting aboXt yoX, I'd seek yoXr permission before beginning—"

"1o, no, Irv,"  she broke in, "I'm not Zorried aboXt yoXr Zriting. I'm Zorried
aboXt yoXr not Zriting. I Zant my story to be told. There's too mXch that
therapists don't knoZ aboXt treating the bereaved. I Zant yoX to tell other
therapists not only Zhat I've learned bXt v/h]i yoX've learned."

In the Zeeks that folloZed, I not only missed Irene bXt, again and again,
foXnd myself mXsing aboXt Zriting her story. Soon my interest in other
Zriting  project Zaned and I began to sketch in an oXtline, at first in a
desXltory manner, then Zith increasing commitment.

Several Zeeks after Ze terminated, Irene and I met for a final check-in
session. She had gone throXgh a period of moXrning the loss of oXr
relationship. For e[ample, she dreamed Ze Zere still meeting, she imagined
conversations Zith me and mistakenly thoXght she saZ my face in a croZd
or heard my voice addressing her. BXt, by the time Ze met, the grief aboXt
ending therapy had passed, and she Zas enjoying life and relating Zell to
herself and to others. She Zas especially strXck Zith her change in visXal
perception: everything had become fleshed oXt again, Zhere for years her
sXrroXndings had appeared as a tZo-dimensional stage set. 0oreover, a
relationship Zith a man, .evin,  Zhom she had met in oXr last feZ months
of therapy had not only endXred, bXt Zas floXrishing. When I mentioned
that I had changed my mind and Zas noZ interested in Zriting aboXt oXr
therapy, she Zas pleased and agreed to read early drafts as I proceeded.

141
Several Zeeks later, I sent Irene a draft of the first thirty pages and
sXggested Ze meet to discXss them in a San Francisco cafe. I felt
XnaccoXntably tense as I entered and looked aboXt for her. Spotting her
before she saZ me, I took my time aboXt going Xp to her. I Zanted to savor
her from afar—her pastel sZeater and slacks, her ease of postXre as she
sipped a cappXccino and broZsed throXgh a San Francisco neZspaper. I
approached. When she saZ me, she stood, and Ze embraced and kissed on
the cheeks mXch like old dear friends—as, indeed, Ze Zere. I ordered a
cappXccino also. After my first sip, Irene smiled and reached over Zith her
napkin to dab at the Zhite froth on my mXstache. I liked her taking care of
me, and leaned forZard jXst a bit to feel the pressXre of her napkin more
fXlly.

"1oZ,"  she said, the dabbing done, "that's better. 1o Zhite mXstache—I
don't Zant yoX aging prematXrely." Then, taking my manXscript oXt of her
briefcase, she said, "I like this. It's jXst Zhat I hoped yoX'd Zrite."

"And that's Zhat I hoped yoX'd say BXt, first, shoXldn't Ze back Xp and talk
aboXt the project as a Zhole?" I told her that in my revision I ZoXld make
certain to conceal her identity so that

142

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

none of her aTXaintances might identify her. "HoZ ZoXld yoX feel aboXt
being portrayed as a male art dealer?"

She shook her head. "I Zant it jXst as I really am. I have nothing to hide,
nothing to be ashamed of. We both knoZ I Zasn't mentally distXrbed: I Zas
a sXfferer."

Something had been Zorrying me aboXt this project, and I decided to get it
off my chest. "Irene, let me tell yoX a story."

I then told her aboXt 0ary, a good friend of mine, a psychiatrist of great
integrity and compassion, and the patient, HoZard, she had treated for ten
years. HoZard had been horribly abXsed as a child, and 0ary made a

142
HercXlean attempt to re-parent him. In the first years of therapy, he had at
least a do]en hospitali]ations for sXicide attempts, sXbstance abXse, and
severe anore[ia. She stood by him, did marveloXs Zork, and somehoZ got
him throXgh everything, helped him to gradXate from high school, college,
and joXrnalism school.

"Her dedication Zas e[traordinary," I said. "Sometimes she met Zith him
seven times a Zeek—and for greatly redXced fees. In fact, I often Zarned
her that she Zas overly invested and needed to protect her private life more.
Her office Zas in her home, and her hXsband objected to HoZards intrXding
on their SXndays and to the amoXnt of 0ary's time and energy he
consXmed. HoZard Zas a ZonderfXl teaching case, and every year 0ary
intervieZed him in front of  medical stXdents as part of their basic
psychiatry coXrse. For a long time, maybe five years, she labored on a
psychotherapy te[tbook in Zhich her therapy of HoZard played an
important role. Each chapter Zas based on some aspect (heavily disgXised,
of coXrse) of her Zork Zith him. And, over the years, HoZard Zas gratefXl
to 0ary  and gave her fXll permission both to present him to medical
stXdents and residents and to Zrite aboXt him.

"Finally the book Zas finished, aboXt to be pXblished, Zhen HoZard (noZ a
joXrnalist stationed abroad, married, Zith tZo children) sXddenly ZithdreZ
his permission. In a short letter he e[plained only that he Zanted to pXt that
part of his life far behind him. 0ary  asked for e[planation, bXt he refXsed to
give more details

and Xltimately broke off commXnication entirely. 0ary Zas distraXght—all
those years she had devoted to that book—and, eventXally, had no choice
bXt to bXry it. Even years later she remained embittered and depressed."

"Irv, Irv, I get yoXr drift,"  said Irene, patting my hand to still me. "I
Xnderstand yoX don't Zant to go 0ary's Zay. BXt let me reassXre yoX: I'm
not jXst giving yoX permission to Zrite my story, I'm asking yoX to Zrite it.
I'd be disappointed if yoX didn't."

"That's pXtting it strongly."

143
"I mean it. I meant Zhat I said aboXt too many therapists not having a clXe
aboXt treating the bereaved. YoX've learned from oXr Zork together, learned
a lot, and / don } t Zant it to end Zith yoX.'"

1oting my raised eyebroZs, Irene added, "Yes, yes, I have finally gotten it.
It's sXnk in. YoX're not going to be aroXnd forever."

"2kay,"  I said, taking oXt a notepad, "I agree I've learned a great deal from
oXr Zork, and I've pXt my version of it into these pages. BXt I Zant to be
certain yoXr voice is heard, Irene. CoXld yoX take a crack at sXmmari]ing
the central points, the parts I mXstn't omit?"

Irene demXrred, "YoX knoZ them as Zell as I do."

"I Zant yoXr voice. 0y  first  choice, as I've said on other occasions, is for Xs
to Zrite together, bXt since yoX Zon't do that, jXst take a stab at it noZ.
Free-associate—top of yoXr head stXff. Tell me, from yoXr perspective,
Zhat Zas the real center, the core of oXr Zork?"

"Engagement," she said at once. "YoX Zere alZays there, leaning forZard,
getting closer. -Xst like Zhen I Ziped the cappXccino froth from yoXr
mXstache a minXte ago—"

"In yoXr face, yoX mean?"

"5ight!  BXt in a good Zay. And not in any fancy metaphysical Zay. I
needed jXst one thing: for yoX to stay Zith me and be Zilling to e[pose
yoXrself to the lethal stXff radiating from me. That Zas yoXr task.

"Therapists don't generally Xnderstand this," she continXed. "1o one else
bXt yoX coXld do this. 0y friends coXldn't stay Zith

144

me. They themselves Zere too bXsy grieving for -ack, or distancing
themselves from the oo]e, or bXrying the fear of their oZn death, or
demanding -and I do mean demanding—that I feel okay after the first year.

144
"That's Zhat yoX really did best," Irene continXed. She spoke TXickly,
flXendy, and stopped only to sip her cappXccino. "YoX had good staying
poZer. YoX hXng in there close to me. 0ore than jXst staying close, yoX
kept pXshing for more and more, Xrging me to talk aboXt everything, no
matter hoZ macabre. And if I didn't, yoX Zere likely to gXess -pretty
accXrately, I'll hand it to yoX—Zhat I Zas feeling.

"And yoXr actions Zere important—Zords alone ZoXldn't have done it.
That's Zhy one of the best single things yoX did Zas to tell me I had to see
yoX an e[tra session every time I got really enraged Zith yoX."

When she paXsed, I looked Xp from my notes. "2ther XsefXl interventions?"

"Coming to -ack's fXneral. 3honing me Zhen yoX Zere aZay on long trips
to check on hoZ I Zas doing. Holding my hand Zhen I needed it. That Zas
precioXs, especially Zhen -ack Zas dying. Sometimes I felt like I'd jXst drift
off into oblivion  if it Zeren't  for yoXr hand anchoring me to my life. It's
fXnny, most of the rime I thoXght of yoX as a magXs—someone Zho knoZs
ahead of time e[acdy Zhat's going to happen. That vision of yoX began to
fade only a feZ months ago Zhen yoX started to get smaller. Yet all along I
had an opposing, anti-magXs, feeling—a feeling that yoX had no script
Zhatsoever, no rXles, no planned procedXre. It Zas as if yoX Zere
improvising on the spot."

"What did that improvising feel like to yoX?" I asked, scribbling TXickly.

"9ery scary sometimes. I Zanted yoX to be the 2] Wi]ard. I Zas lost, and I
Zanted yoX to knoZ the Zay home to .ansas. Sometimes I Zas sXspicioXs
of yoXr Xncertainty. I Zondered if yoXr improvisation Zas real or Zhether it
Zas jXst a pretense at improvisation, jXst yoXr Zi]ard's Zay.

"Another thing, yoX kneZ hoZ mXch I insist on figXring oXt hoZ to fi[
things for myself. So I thoXght yoXr improvising Zith me Zas a plan—a
pretty canny plan—to disarm me.

"Another thoXght. . . yoX Zant me to jXst ramble like this, Irv?"

"E[actly  like this—keep going."

145
"When yoX told me aboXt other ZidoZs or aboXt yoXr research findings, I
kneZ yoX Zere trying to reassXre me, and once in a Zhile it helped to
reali]e that I Zas in the midst of a process, that I ZoXld pass throXgh certain
states of mind jXst as other Zomen had done. BXt generally that kind of
comment left me feeling diminished. It Zas as thoXgh yoX Zere making me
ordinary. I never felt ordinary Zhen Ze Zere improvising. Then I Zas
special, XniTXe. We Zere finding oXr Zay together."

"2ther helpfXl things?"

"Again, simple things. YoX may not even remember, bXt at the end of one of
oXr very first sessions, as I Zas Zalking oXt the door, yoX pXt yoXr hand on
my shoXlder and said, 'I'll see this throXgh Zith yoX.' I never forgot that
statement—it Zas a mighty staff of sXpport."

"I remember, Irene."

"And it helped a lot Zhen sometimes yoX'd stop trying to fi[ or to analy]e
or interpret me and yoX'd say something simple and straight like, Irene,
yoX're going throXgh a nightmare—one of the Zorst I can imagine.' And the
best thing of all Zas Zhen yoX'd add—not often enoXgh—that yoX admired
and respected me for my coXrage in persevering."

Thinking to say something aboXt her coXrage noZ, I glanced Xp and saZ her
looking at her Zatch, heard her say, "2h dear, I've got to go."

So she Zas ending the session. HoZ far the mighty have fallen! For a
moment I had an impish impXlse to fake a tantrXm and accXse her of
throZing me oXt bXt decided not to be so childish.

"I knoZ  Zhat yoX're thinking, Irv."

"What's that?"

"YoX probably find the reversal amXsing—that it's I, not yoX,

146

Seven Advanced /essons in the Therapy of Grief

146
ending the session"

"5ight  on, Irene. As XsXal."

"YoX going to be here for a feZ minXtes? I'm meeting .evin doZn the street
for lXnch and can bring him Xp here to meet yoX. I'd like to do that."

While Zaiting  for Irene to retXrn Zith .evin,  I  tried to sTXare her accoXnt
of therapy Zith my oZn. According  to her, I had helped most of all by
engaging her, by shrinking aZay from nothing she said or did. And I
helped, too, by holding her hand, by improvising, by confirming the horror
of her ordeal, and by promising to see it throXgh Zith her.

I bridled at sXch simplification. SXrely my approach to therapy Zas more
comple[ and sophisticated. BXt the more I thoXght aboXt it, the more I came
to see that Irene had it TXite right.

For sXre she Zas right aboXt "engagement"—the key concept in my
psychotherapy. I had decided at the very onset that engagement Zas the
most effective thing I coXld offer Irene. And that did not simply mean good
listening, or encoXraging catharsis, or consoling her. It meant rather that I
ZoXld get as close as I coXld to her, that I ZoXld focXs on "the space
betZeen Xs" (a phrase I Xsed in virtXally every hoXr I saZ Irene), on the
"here-and-noZ": that is, on the relationship betZeen her and me here (in
this office) and noZ (in the immediate moment).

1oZ  it is one thing to focXs on the here-and-noZ Zith patients Zho seek
therapy becaXse of relationship problems bXt another matter completely for
me to have asked Irene to e[amine the here-and-noZ. Think of it: Is it not
both absXrd and chXrlish to e[pect a Zoman in e[tremis (a Zoman Zhose
hXsband lay dying of a brain tXmor, Zho is also grieving a mother, a father,
a brother, a godson) to tXrn her attention to the most minXte nXances of a
relationship Zith a professional she hardly knoZs?

1onetheless, this Zas jXst Zhat I did. I began it in the first sessions and
never relented. In every session, ZithoXt fail, I inTXired aboXt some aspect
of oXr relationship. "HoZ lonely do yoX feel in the room Zith me?" "HoZ
far, hoZ close from me, do yoX feel

147
today?" If she said, as she often did, "I feel miles aZay," I Zas sXre to
address that direcdy. "At Zhat precise point of oXr session did yoX first
notice that today." 2r, "What did I say or do to increase the distance?" And
most of all, "What can Ze do to redXce it?"

I tried to honor her responses. If she ansZered, "The best Zay for Xs to be
closer is for yoX to give me the name of a good novel to read," I alZays
responded Zith a tide. If she said that her despair Zas too overZhelming for
Zords, and the most I coXld do Zas simply to hold her hand, then I moved
my chair closer and held her hand, sometimes for a minXte or tZo,
sometimes for ten or fifteen minXtes. I Zas sometimes Xncomfortable aboXt
the hand-holding, it Zas not becaXse of all the legalistic proscriptions
against ever toXching a patient: to sXrrender one's clinical and creative
jXdgment to sXch concerns is deeply corrXpting. 5ather, I Zas
Xncomfortable becaXse the hand-holding Zas invariably effective: it made
me feel like a magXs, someone Zith e[traordinary poZers I didn't
Xnderstand. 8ltimately, a feZ months after she had bXried her hXsband,
Irene stopped needing and reTXesting hand-holding.

ThroXghoXt oXr therapy I Zas dogged aboXt engagement I refXsed to be
pXshed aZay To her, "I'm nXmb, I don't Zant to talk, I don't knoZ Zhy I'm
here today," I responded Zith some comment like, "BXt yoX are here. Some
part of yoX Zants to be here, and I Zant to talk to that part today."

Whenever possible I translated events into their here-and-noZ eTXivalent.
For e[ample, consider the beginnings and endings of the hoXr. FreTXently
Irene entered my office and Zalked briskly to her chair ZithoXt even a
glance at me. I rarely let that pass. I might say "2h, so it's going to be one
of those sessions," and focXsed on her relXctance to look at me. Sometimes
she responded, "/ooking at yoX makes yoXr real and that means yoX'll have
to die soon." 2r, "If  I look at yoX, that makes me feel helpless and gives yoX
too mXch poZer over me." 2r, "If I look  at yoX, I might Zant to kiss yoX";
or, "I'll see yoXr eyes demanding that I get Zell TXickly."

The ending of ever}  session Zas problematic: she hated my having so
mXch control and balked at leaving my office. Every

148

148

ending Zas like a death. DXring her most difficXlt periods, she Zas Xnable
to keep images in her mind and feared that, once I Zas oXt of sight, I ZoXld
cease to e[ist. She also considered endings of sessions as symbols of hoZ
little she meant to me, hoZ little I cared for her, hoZ TXickly I coXld
dispense Zith her. 0y vacations or professional trips invariably posed sXch
major problems that, on a feZ occasions, I chose to phone to see hoZ she
Zas.

Everything became grist for the here-and-noZ mill: her Zishes for me to
compliment her, to tell her that I thoXght aboXt her more than my other
patients, to acknoZledge that, Zere Ze not therapist and patient, I ZoXld
desire her as a Zoman.

2rdinarily  the here-and-noZ focXs in psychotherapy has many advantages.
It imparts a sense of immediacy to the therapy session. It provides more
accXrate data than relying on patients' imperfect and ever-shifting vieZ of
the past. Since one's mode of relating in the here-and-noZ is a social
microcosm of one's mode of relating to others, both past and present, one's
problems in relating are immediately revealed, in living color, as the
relationship Zith the therapist XnfXrls. FXrthermore, therapy becomes more
intense, more electric—no individXal or groXp session focXsing on the here-
and-noZ is ever dXll. 0oreover the here-and-noZ provides a laboratory, a
safe arena, in Zhich a patient can e[periment Zith neZ behaviors before
trying them in the Zorld oXtside.

Even more important than all these benefits, the here-and-noZ approach
also accelerated the development of a deep intimacy betZeen Xs. Irene's
oXtZard demeanor—frosty, forbidding, sXpremely competent and confident
—kept others from approaching her. This Zas precisely Zhat happened
Zhen I placed her in a si[-month therapy groXp at the time her hXsband Zas
dying. ThoXgh Irene TXickly Zon the members' respect and she provided
considerable help to others, she received little in retXrn. Her air of sXpreme
self-sXfficiency told the other groXp members she needed nothing from
them.

2nly  her hXsband had cXt throXgh her formidable demeanor,

149
only he had challenged her and demanded a deep intimate encoXnter. And it
Zas only Zith him  that she coXld Zeep and give voice to the yoXng lost girl
Zithin  her. And Zith -ack's death she lost that toXchstone of intimacy. I
kneZ it Zas presXmptXoXs, bXt I Zanted to become that toXchstone for her.

Was I attempting to replace her hXsband? That's a crass, shocking TXestion.
1o, I never thoXght to do that. BXt I did aspire to reestablish, for one or tZo
hoXrs a Zeek, an island of intimacy, a place Zhere she coXld doff her fi[-it,
sXper-sXrgeon state of mind and be openly vXlnerable and challenged.
GradXally, very gradXally, she Zas able to acknoZledge feelings of
helplessness and tXrn to me for comfort.

When her father died not long after her hXsband's death, she felt
overZhelmed at the thoXght of flying home for the fXneral. She coXld not
bear the idea of facing her Al]heimer-stricken mother and seeing her
father's open grave ne[t to her brother's tombstone. I agreed, and strongly
advised her not to go. Instead, I schedXled a session at the e[act time of the
fXneral, asked her to bring pictXres of her father, and Ze spent the hoXr
recalling memories of her father. It Zas a rich, poZerfXl e[perience, and
later Irene thanked me for it.

Where Zas the line betZeen intimacy and sedXction? WoXld she become
too dependent on me? WoXld she ever be able to break aZay? WoXld the
poZerfXl hXsband transference prove irresolvable? Again and again, that
thoXght nagged at me. BXt I decided to Zorry aboXt it later.

The here-and-noZ focXs Zas never difficXlt to sXstain in my Zork Zith
Irene. She Zas e[traordinarily hard Zorking and dedicated. 1ever, not once
in all my Zork  Zith her, did I hear resistive comments like, "This doesn't
make sense . . . It's irrelevant .. . YoX are not the issXe . .. YoX're not my life
—I see yoX only tZo hoXrs a Zeek, my hXsband died only tZo Zeeks ago—
Zhy do yoX press me aboXt my feelings toZard yoX? —This is cra]y . . . All
these TXestions aboXt the Zay I look at yoX, or the Zay I Zalk into this
office—they're too trivial to talk aboXt. Too many big things

are going on in my life." 2n the contrary, Irene immediately grasped Zhat I
Zas trying to do and throXghoXt therapy seemed gratefXl for all my attempts
to engage her.

Irene's remarks aboXt my "improvising" therapy Zere of great interest to
me. /ately I  have foXnd myself proclaiming, "The good therapist mXst
create a neZ therapy for each patient." That is an e[treme position, more
radical even than -Xng's sXggestion, many years ago, that Ze create a neZ
therapy langXage for each patient. BXt radical positions for these radical
times.

The contemporary managed-care movement in health care poses a deadly
threat to the field of psychotherapy. Consider its mandates: (i) that therapy
be Xnrealistically brief, focXsing e[clXsively on oXtZard symptoms rather
than on the Xnderlying conflicts that breed those symptoms; (2) that therapy
be Xnrealistically ine[pensive (Zhich is pXnishing both to the professionals
Zho have invested the necessary years for in-depth training and pXnishing
to patients Zho are forced to consXlt inadeTXately trained therapists); (3)
that therapists mimic the medical model and go throXgh the charade of
formXlating precise medical-like goals and condXcting Zeekly evalXations
of them); (4) that therapists employ only empirically validated therapies
(E9Ts), thXs favoring brief, apparently precise cognitive-behavioral modes
Zhich demonstrate symptom alleviation.

BXt, of all these Zrong-headed and catastrophic assaXlts on the field of
psychotherapy, none is more ominoXs than the trend toZard protocol-driven
therapy. ThXs, some health plans and H02s reTXire that the therapist
folloZ  a prescribed plan for the coXrse of therapy, at times even a schedXle
of items to be covered in each of the alloZed sessions. The profit-hXngry
health care e[ecXtives and their misgXided professional advisors assXme
that sXccessfXl therapy is a fXnction of information obtained or dispensed
rather than the resXlt of the relationship betZeen patient and therapist. This
is a grievoXs error.

151
2f  the eighty bereaved men and Zomen I had stXdied in my research before
seeing Irene, not one Zas like her. 1one sXffered

the same constellation of recent (and cXmXlative) losses—hXsband, father,
mother, friend, godson. 1one had been traXmati]ed in jXst the Zay she had
by the earlier loss of a dearly loved sibling. 1one had the e[traordinarily
interdependent relationship she had Zith her hXsband. 1one had Zatched a
spoXse deconstitXte, bit by bit, crXelly devoXred by a brain tXmor . 1one
had been a physician Zho Xnderstood all too Zell the natXre of her
hXsband's pathology and its prognosis.

1o, Irene Zas XniTXe and reTXired a XniTXe therapy, one she and I had to
constrXct together. And it Zasn't that she and I constrXcted a therapy and
then set aboXt employing it: TXite the contrary, the project of constrXcting a
neZ, XniTXe therapy Zas the therapy itself.

I looked at my Zatch. Where is Irene? I Zalked to the door of the cafe and
peered oXt. There she Zas, a block aZay, Zalking hand in hand Zith a man
Zho mXst be .evin.  Irene and a man, hand in hand. Is it possible? I thoXght
of all the coXntless hoXrs I had spent trying to reassXre her that she Zas not
doomed to being alone, that Xltimately there ZoXld be another man in her
life. God, she had been stXbborn! And the opportXnities had been legion:
early in her bereavement there had been a long TXeXe of attractive and
appropriate sXitors.

She had rejected each man TXickly for one or more of Zhat seemed an
endless list of reasons. "I don't dare love again becaXse I can't endXre
another loss" (that attitXde, alZays the top of the list, resXlted in her
rejecting, oXt of hand, any man even slighdy older than herself or any man
not in the best possible physical condition). "I don't Zant to doom any man
by loving him." "I  refXse to betray -ack." She compared every man
Xnfavorably to -ack, Zho Zas the perfect and predestined mate for her (he
had knoZn her family, had been hand-chosen by her brother, and
represented a last link Zith her dead brother, her father, and her dying
mother). FXrthermore, Irene Zas convinced that there Zas no man Zho
coXld ever Xnderstand her, no man Zho ZoXld not, like Frost's farmer, bring
the shovel into the kitchen. E[cept, pos-

sibly, a member of the society of the recently bereaved, someone Zho had
an acXte aZareness of his or her Xltimate destination and the precioXsness
of life.

3icky. 3icky. 3icky. 3erfect health. Athletic. Slim. YoXnger than she. 5ecent
bereavement. E[traordinary sensibility to art, literatXre, and e[istential
concerns. I greZ impatient Zith Irene and the impossible standards she set.
I thoXght of all the other ZidoZs I had Zorked Zith,  Zho ZoXld have given
anything for any attention Zhatsoever paid by any of the men Irene had
sXmmarily rejected. I did my best to keep these sentiments to myself bXt
she missed nothing, not even my Xne[pressed thoXghts, and greZ angry at
my Zish that she become involved Zith a man. ''YoX're trying to force me to
compromise!" she accXsed.

3erhaps, too, she Zas sensing my groZing alarm that she ZoXld never let
me go. I believed that her attachment to me Zas a major factor in her
refXsing to engage a man. God, ZoXld I be bXrdened Zith her forever?
3erhaps that Zas my penalty for having sXcceeded in becoming so
important to her.

And then .evin  entered her life. From the beginning she kneZ he Zas the
man she had been seeking. I marveled at her certainty— her prescience. I
thoXght of all those impossible, ridicXloXs, standards she had set. Well, he
met every single one of them, and then some. YoXth, perfect health,
sensitivity—he Zas even a member of the society of the secretly bereaved.
His Zife had died a year previoXsly, and he and Irene fXlly Xnderstood and
empathi]ed Zith each other's moXrning. Eveiything clicked immediately,
and I Zas overjoyed for Irene—and for my oZn liberation. Before she met
.evin,  she had entirely regained her high level of fXnctioning in the oXtside
Zorld, bXt there had remained a deep and almost ine[pressible inner
sadness and resignation. 1oZ that, too, had rapidly resolved. Had she
improved as a resXlt of meeting .evin? 2r had she been able to be open to
him becaXse she had improved? Some of each? I coXld never be certain.

153
And noZ she Zas bringing .evin  to meet me. Here they come, throXgh the
cafe entrance. They're Zalking toZards me.

Why am I nervoXs? /ook at that man: he's gorgeoXs—tall, poZerfXl, looks
like he does a triathlon every day before breakfast, and that nose . . .
Xnbelievable . . . Zhere do yoX bXy noses like that? EnoXgh, .evin, let go
of her hand. EnoXgh already! There's got to be something not to like aboXt
this gXy. 2ops, I'm going to have to shake hands Zith him. Why are my
hands sZeating so? Will he notice? Who cares Zhat he notices?

"Irv," I  heard Irene say, "this is .evin. .evin,  Irv."  I smiled, held oXt my
hand, and greeted him throXgh clenched jaZs. Damn yoX, I thoXght, yoX'd
better take good care of her. And, Goddammit, yoX'd better not die.

I o that, Dr. /ash, is Zhy I  feel like giving Xp. There are no men oXt there.
And if they're still Xnmarried in their forties, then obvioXsly something's
Zrong— creeps, rejects, diseased—some other Zoman didn't Zant them

"Where do yoXr thoXghts go, /inda?"

154
"Thinking aboXt being trapped—thinking aboXt going to Alaska Zhere the
man-Zoman ratio is better. 2r to bXsiness school—good ratio there."

"Stay here in the room Zith me, /inda. What's it been like being here

"What do yoX mean?"

"Same thing I alZays mean. Try to talk aboXt Zhat's going on here, betZeen

"FrXstrating! Another hXndred-fifty-dollar pop and I don't feel better."

"So I failed again today. Took yoXr money and didn't help. Tell me,
something, /inda, see if—"

Braking sharply, /inda sZerved to avoid a trXck cXtting into her lane. She
sped Xp, passed him, screamed, "Asshole!"

She tXrned off the tape and took a feZ deep breaths. Several months ago,
after their first feZ sessions, her neZ shrink, Dr. Ernest /ash, had begXn
recording their sessions and giving her the tape to listen to the folloZing
Zeek as she drove to the ne[t session. Each Zeek she retXrned the cassette,
and he recorded the neZ session over the old one. A good Zay, he said, to
Xse the commXte time from /os Altos to San Francisco. She Zasn't so sXre.
The hoXrs had been frXstrating in the first place, and going throXgh them a
second time Zas only more frXstrating. The trXck having gained on her,
flashed his lights to pass. 3Xlling over a lane, she cXrsed the trXcker as he
gave her the finger. SXppose she had an accident becaXse she Zas distracted
by listening to the tape? CoXld she sXe her shrink? Take his ass into coXrt.
That broXght a smile to her lips. /eaning over, /inda pressed "reZind" for a

"YoX coXld have introdXced me to one of yoXr rich single patients."

"YoX see 'Dating BXreaX' on my T-shirt?"

"YoX bastard," she mXttered, pXnching the "stop" bXtton. "I pay yoX one

"/et's  go over it again, /inda. YoX originally came in to see me saying yoX
Zanted to do something aboXt yoXr relationships Zith men. In oXr very first

"I already said 'frXstrating.'"

"Try to make that more personal, /inda."

"FrXstrating is personal."

"Yeah, in a Zay it's personal, it tells me aboXt yoXr inner state. Things go

yoX're here, too. And I get di]]y Zith  yoX. And I feel yoXr frXstration. BXt

"Told yoX already, nothing. The space is empty. -Xst frXstration."

"Go back to yoXr fantasy. What do yoX see ne[t?"

"Fade to black—gone."

"Don't knoZ. Felt cold and alone."

"YoX Zere Zith me. YoX took my hand. What feelings came Xp?"

"Still felt  alone."

/inda  heard chairs being moved, her footsteps crossing the room, the
closing of the door. She tXrned onto I-280. Waste of rime and money, she
thoXght. Shrinks. He's jXst like all the rest. Well, not TXite. At least he talks
to me. For a moment she imagined his face: he smiling, holding his arms
oXt to her, inviting her to come closer. TrXth is, I like Dr. /ash. He's in there
Zith me— at least, he seems to care aboXt Zhat happens to me And he's
active: He tries to keep things going—he goes halfZay, he doesn't leave me
sitting in silence like the last tZo shrinks. She TXickly brXshed aside these
images. He Zas alZays nagging her to keep track of her daydreams,
especially those occXrring on the drive to and from the therapy hoXr, and
she Zas not aboXt to tell him this corny stXff.

SXddenly she heard his voice again.

"Hello. This is Ernest /ash retXrning yoXr call. Sorry to miss yoX,
Desmond. 3lease try to reach me at 613 betZeen eight and ten this
evening or in my office first thing tomorroZ  morn-

What's going on? she Zondered. She recalled hoZ, after leaving his office at
the end of the last session and driving a half-block aZay, she reali]ed he
had forgotten to give her the tape, and retXrned for it. She doXble-parked in
front of the 9ictorian hoXse and sprinted Xp its long stairZay to his office
on the second floor. Since she Zas his last hoXr of the day, she hadn't
Zorried aboXt interrXpting another patient. His door Zas partially open, and
she Zalked right in, to find Dr. /ash speaking into a dictating machine.
When she told him Zhy she'd retXrned, he removed the cassette from the
tape recorder on the table ne[t to the patient's chair and gave it to her. "See
yoX ne[t Zeek," he said. Clearly he'd forgotten to tXrn off the tape recorder

159
Zhen she'd left his office the first time, and it had been recording for some
time before the tape ran oXt.

TXrning the volXme all the Zay Xp, /inda heard faint noises: possibly coffee
mXgs clinking as he cleared them from his desk. Then his voice again, as he
phoned someone to arrange a tennis appointment. Footsteps, the scrape of a
chair. And then something more interesting. 0Xch more interesting.

"This is Dr. /ash dictating notes for coXnter-transference seminar. 1otes on
/inda,  ThXrsday, 28 0arch."

1otes on me? I can't believe it. Straining to hear, clXtched Zith an[iety and
cXriosity, she leaned forZard closer to the speaker. SXddenly the car
sZerved, and she almost lost control.

She pXlled over to the side of the highZay, hXrriedly ejected the tape, took
her Walkman from the glove compartment, inserted the tape, reZoXnd it,
pXt on the headphones, eased back into the freeZay, and tXrned the volXme

betZeen Xs. 1othing I do is good enoXgh for her. 3resses so many—"

A passing car's honk roXsed her to the fact that her car Zas Zeaving.
/inda's heart poXnded. This Zas dangeroXs. She sZitched off the Walkman
and drove the feZ minXtes to her tXrnoff. She pXlled into a side street,
parked, reZoXnd, and listened:

... I feel demeaned. She is a vXlgar lady. Does everything possible to
eliminate any shred of closeness betZeen Xs. 1othing I do is good enoXgh
for her. 3resses so many of my bXttons that there's got to be something of
my mother in this. Every time I ask her aboXt the therapy relationship, she
gives me that Zary look as thoXgh I'm coming on to her. Am I? 1ot a
Zhisper of it Zhen I check into my feelings. WoXld I if she Zeren't my
patient? 1ot a bad-looking Zoman—I like her hair, gleaming— carries
herself Zell—great-looking chest, popping those bXttons—that's definitely
a plXs. I Zorry aboXt staring at those breasts, bXt don't think I do—thanks to
Alice! In high school once, I Zas talking to a girl named Alice and hadn't

161
any idea that I Zas staring at her tits Xntil she pXt her hand Xnder my chin
and tilted my face Xp and said, "Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, I'm Xp here!" I never
forgot. That Alice did me a big favor.

/inda's hands are too big, that's a tXrn-off. BXt I do like that great slick se[y
sZish of her stockings as she crosses her legs. Yeah, I gXess there are some
se[Xal feelings there. If I had rXn into her Zhen I Zas still single, ZoXld I
have hit on her? 3robably yes, I'd be attracted to her physically, Xntil she
opened her moXth and started Zhining or demanding. Then I'd Zant to get
aZay fast. There's no tenderness, no softness to her . She's too self-focXsed,
all sharp angles—elboZs, knees, Xngiving—" (A click as the tape came to
an end.)

In a da]e, /inda started the car, drove a feZ minXtes, and tXrned right on
Sacramento Street. 2nly a feZ blocks noZ to Dr. /ash's office. She noticed,
Zith sXrprise, that she Zas trembling. What to do? What to say to him?
4Xickly, TXickly—only  a feZ minXtes Xntil his goddamn clock starts
ticking off that hXndred-

162

DoXble E[posXre

and-fifty-dollar hoXr.

2ne thing for sXre, she told herself, there is no Zay I'm going to give back
the tape as I XsXally do. I've got to hear it again. I'll lie, say I forgot it, left it
at home. Then I can re-record his comments onto another tape and bring
back the original ne[t Zeek. 2r  maybe I'll jXst say I lost the tape. If he
doesn't like it—toXgh!

The more she thoXght aboXt it, the sXrer she Zas that she ZoXld not tell him
she'd heard his dictation. Why give aZay her hand? 0aybe she'd tell him
some time in the fXtXre. 0aybe never. The bastard! She pXlled Xp to his
office. FoXr o'clock. Talking time.

"/inda,  come in please." Ernest alZays called her /inda, and she called him
Dr. /ash, even thoXgh he had often pointed oXt the asymmetry and invited

162
her to call him by his first name. That day he Zas, as alZays, Zas dressed in
his navy blXe bla]er and Zhite tXrtleneck sZeater. Doesn't he oZn any other
clothes? she Zondered. And those scXffed 5ockports. CasXal is one thing,
sloppy another. Hasn't he ever heard of a shoe shine? And that jacket
doesn't hide the spare tire aroXnd his Zaist. If I Zere playing tennis Zith
yoX, she thoXght, I'd lob yoX to death. I'd get those fat little pork chops of
yoXrs pXmping.

"1o problem,"  he said affably, Zhen she confessed to having forgotten the
tape. "Bring it ne[t Zeek. I've  got a fresh one," He XnZrapped a neZ tape
and inserted it into the recorder.

After that, the XsXal silence. /inda sighed.

"YoX look troXbled," Ernest commented.

"1o, 1o,"  /inda   denied. 3hony! she thoXght. What a phony! 3retending to
be so concerned. YoX don't care if I'm troXbled. YoX don't give a shit. I
knoZ hoZ yoX really feel aboXt me.

0ore  silence.

"I feel a great deal of distance betZeen Xs," Ernest remarked. "Do yoX feel
that Zay, too?"

/inda  shrXgged her shoXlders. "I don't knoZ."

"I'm Zondering, /inda,  aboXt last Zeek. Did yoX take home any strong
feelings aboXt oXr session?"

"1othing  oXt of the ordinary," I have the Xpper hand, /inda told herself, and
I'm going to make him Zork for his money today. I Zant to see him sZeat.
She dreZ oXt a long paXse before asking, "ShoXld I have?"

"What?"

"ShoXld! have had strong feelings aboXt the last session?"

163
SXrprise shoZed on Ernest's face. He looked at /inda. She stared back
Xnflinchingly. "Well," he said, "I Zondered Zhether yoX might have had
any feelings. 0aybe some reactions to my comment aboXt my T-shirt and
the dating bXreaX?"

"Did yoX have any feelings aboXt that comment, Dr. /ash?"

Ernest straightened in his chair—he had the oddest feeling aboXt her
boldness today. "Yes, I had a lot of feelings aboXt it," he said hesitantly.
"1one or them good feelings. I felt I Zas disrespectfXl to yoX. I can imagine
yoX being pretty angry Zith me."

"Well, I Zas angry."

"And hXrt?"

"Yes, hXrt, too."

"Think of that hXrt feeling. Does it take yoX to some other place? Some
other time?"

2h no, yoX don't, yoX Zorm, /inda thoXght. Trying to sTXirm aZay. And all
these Zeeks lectXring me on staying in the present. "Can Ze stay Zith yoX,
Dr. /ash, here in this office?" she said to him, Zith her neZ directness, "I'd
like to knoZ Zhy  yoX said it— Zhy yoX Zere, as yoX pXt it, disrespectfXl."

Ernest took another look at /inda. A longer one. He pondered his options.
DXty to his patient, that came first. Today, finally, /inda seemed Zilling to
engage him. For months he had been Xrging, e[horting, begging her, to stay
in the here-and-noZ. So, encoXrage her efforts, he told himself. And remain
honest.

Honesty, above all. A devoXt skeptic in all other matters, Ernest believed in
Zith fXndamentalist fervor the healing poZer of honesty. His catechism
called for honesty—bXt tempered, selective honesty. And responsible,
caring honesty: honesty in the service of caring. He ZoXld never, for
e[ample, reveal to her the harsh, negative—bXt

164
164

DoXble E[posXre

honest—feelings toZard her he had e[pressed tZo days earlier, Zhen
presenting /inda at his coXntertransference seminar.

That seminar had started a year ago, as a bi-Zeekly stXdy groXp of ten
therapists Zho met to deepen their Xnderstanding of their personal reactions
to their patients. At each meeting, one member ZoXld discXss a patient by
focXsing almost entirely on the -feelings that patient had evoked in him or
her dXring the therapy hoXrs. Whatever their feelings toZard a particXlar
patient—irrational, primitive, loving,  hatefXl, se[Xal, aggressive—the
members committed themselves to e[pressing them openly and e[ploring
their meaning and roots.

Among the many pXrposes the seminar served, none Zas more important
than the sense of commXnity it provided. Isolation is the leading
occXpational ha]ard of the psychotherapist in private practice, and
therapists combat it by membership in organi]ations: stXdy groXps sXch as
this coXntertransference seminar, advanced training institXtes, hospital staff
associations, and a variety of local and national professional organi]ations.

The coXntertransference seminar loomed large in Ernest's life, and he
looked forZard to the meetings every other Zeek— not only to the
camaraderie bXt also to the consXltation. He had, the previoXs year,
terminated a long sXpervisory e[perience Zith an orthodo[ psychoanalyst,
0arshal Strider, and the seminar Zas noZ the only place Zhere he
discXssed cases Zith colleagXes. ThoXgh the groXp's official focXs Zas Xpon
the inner life of the therapist rather than Xpon the therapy, the discXssion
invariably inflXenced the coXrse of therapy. 0erely knoZing that yoX ZoXld
be presenting a patient inevitably inflXenced the Zay yoX condXcted therapy
Zith that patient. And dXring his session Zith /inda today, Ernest imagined
the seminar members silently observing him as he pondered her TXestion
Zhy he had been disrespectfXl to her. He took care to say nothing that he
ZoXld feel relXctant to report back to the groXp.

165
"I'm not sXre of all the reasons, /inda, bXt I knoZ I Zas impatient Zith yoX
last session Zhen I said it. YoX seemed obstinate. I

had a sense of knocking at yoXr door and yoXr refXsing to open it."

"I Zas doing my best."

"I gXess that didn't register. It seemed to me that yoX kneZ Zhy it Zas
important to focXs on the here-and-noZ, on the relationship betZeen Xs, and
yet yoX kept pretending not to knoZ. /ord knoZs I've tried to spell it oXt
many, many times. 5emember in oXr first session Zhen yoX talked aboXt
yoXr previoXs therapists? YoX said they Zere too distant, too Xninvolved,
too Xncaring? And I told yoX that I ZoXld be engaged Zith yoX, and that
mXch of oXr task here ZoXld be to stXdy that engagement? And yoX said
yoX Zelcomed that?"

"This is not making sense. YoX think I'm deliberately opposing yoX. Tell
me, Zhy ZoXld I come Zeek after Zeek, on a long drive and bloZing one-
fifty an hoXr? 2ne hXndred fifty dollars— maybe small change for yoX bXt
not for me."

"2n one level it doesn't make sense, /inda, yet on another it does. Here's
the Zay I see it. YoX're Xnhappy Zith yoXr life, yoX're lonely, yoX feel
Xnloved and Xnlovable. YoX come to me for help»—at great effort—it is a
long drive. And e[pensive, too—I do hear yoX, /inda. BXt something
strange happens here—I think it's fear. I think getting close makes yoX
Xncomfortable, and then yoX back off, close doZn, find faXlt in me, ridicXle
Zhat Ze're doing. I'm not saying yoX do it deliberately."

"If yoX Xnderstand me so Zell, Zhy the T-shirt comment? YoX still haven't
ansZered that TXestion."

"I Zas addressing that Zhen I mentioned that I felt impatient."

"That doesn't really feel like an ansZer."

Ernest took another long look at his patient. Do I really knoZ her? Whence
this blast of directness? BXt it's a Zelcome, bracing Zind—and anything's

166
better than Zhat Ze've been doing. I'll try to sail Zith it as far as possible.

"YoXr point is Zell taken, /inda.  The T-shirt crack doesn't fit in anyZhere.
A stXpid comment. And a hXrtfXl one. I'm sorry aboXt it. 1ot sXre Zhere it
came from. I Zish I coXld recaptXre

166

DoXble E[posXre

Zhat prompted it."

"I remember from the tape—"

"I thoXght yoX didn't listen to the tape."

"I didn't say that. I said I forgot to bring the tape, bXt I listened to it at
home. The T-shirt comment came right after I said yoX coXld introdXce me
to one of yoXr rich single patients."

"5ight, right,  I remember. I'm impressed, /inda. SomehoZ I had the feeling
that oXr sessions didn't mean enoXgh for yoX to remember them so Zell. /et
me go back into my feelings in that last hoXr. 2ne thing I remember for sXre
—that very comment aboXt introdXcing yoX to one of my rich patients
really bXgged me. -Xst prior to that, I think I had asked Zhat I coXld offer
yoX, and that Zas yoXr ansZer. I felt pXt doZn: yoXr comment hXrt me. I
shoXld be above that, bXt I've got my sore spots—and my blind spots, too."

"HXrt? Aren't Ze being a bit toXchy? -Xst a joke."

"0aybe.  BXt maybe more than a joke. 0aybe yoX Zere giving voice to
yoXr sense that I have little of valXe to offer yoX—at best, an introdXction to
another man. So I felt invisible. DevalXed. And I gXess that's Zhy I lashed
oXt at yoX."

"3oor thing!"  /inda  mXttered.

"What?"

167
"1othing,  nothing—another joke."

"I'm not going to let yoX drive me aZay Zith that kind of comment. In fact,
I'm Zondering Zhether Ze shoXld be meeting more than once a Zeek. For
today, thoXgh, Ze have to stop. We're rXnning over. /et's pick Xp from here
ne[t Zeek."

Ernest Zas glad /inda's hoXr Zas over. BXt not for the cXstomary reasons:
he Zasn't bored or irritated by her; he Zas e[haXsted. 3Xnch-drXnk.
Staggering. 2n the ropes.

BXt /inda hadn't finished pXnching. "YoX really don't like me, do yoX?" she
remarked as she picked Xp her pXrse and started to rise.

"2n the contrary," said Ernest, determined to hang in there Zith his patient,
"I felt particXlarly close to yoX in this session. It Zas scary and hard today,
bXt good Zork."

"That's not e[actly Zhat I asked yoX."

"BXt that's the Zay I feel. There are times Zhen I feel more distant from
yoX, times Zhen I feel close to yoX."

"BXt yoX really don't like me?"

"/iking   isn't a global feeling. Sometimes yoX do things I don't like,
sometimes there are things I like very mXch aboXt yoX."

Yeah, yeah. /ike my big tits and the sZish of my stockings, /inda thoXght,
as she got oXt her car keys. At the door Ernest, as alZays, offered his hand.
She Zas repelled. 3hysical contact Zith him Zas the last thing she Zanted,
bXt she saZ no Zay to refXse. She took his hand lightly, TXickly tXrned it
loose, and left ZithoXt looking back.

For /inda,  sleep came sloZly that night. She lay aZake, Xnable to erase
from her mind Dr. /ash's dictated opinion of her. "Whining," "boring,"
"sharp angles," "narroZ," "vXlgar"—Zhirled aroXnd and aroXnd in her
mind. AZfXl Zords—yet  none of them as hXrtfXl as his commenting that

168
she never said anything interesting or beaXtifXl. His hope that she might
Zrite a poem stXng, broXght tears to her eyes.

A long-forgotten incident drifted into her mind. When she Zas ten or
eleven, she had Zritten a great deal of poetry, bXt had kept it secret—
especially from her grXff, relentlessly critical father. Before she Zas born,
he had been dismissed from his sXrgical residency program becaXse of
alcoholism, and he had lived oXt the rest of his life as a disillXsioned, half-
drXnk, small-toZn doctor Zhose office Zas in his home and Zho spent
every evening in front of the T9, sipping boXrbon from an 2ld Granddad
Zhiskey glass. She had never been able to make him interested in her.
1ever, not once, had he openly e[pressed any love for her.

As a child she'd been an inveterate snooper. 2ne day, Zhile her father Zas
making hoXse calls, she rXmmaged throXgh the Xpper compartments and
draZers of his ZalnXt rolltop desk and foXnd, Xnder a stack of patients'
charts, a packet of yelloZed love letters, some from her mother and some
from a Zoman named Christine. BXried Xnder the letters, she Zas sXrprised
to find

168

DoXble E[posXre

some of her poems Zritten on paper Zhich felt strangely damp. She took
them back and, on impXlse, stole the letters from Christine as Zell. A feZ
days later, on an overcast aXtXmn afternoon, she poked them, along Zith all
the rest of the poems she'd Zritten, into the center of a moXnd of dried
sycamore leaves and pXt a match to it. All that afternoon she sat Zatching
the Zind have its Zill  Zith the ashes of her poetry.

From then on, a veil of silence fell betZeen her and her father. It Zas
impenetrable. He never acknoZledged his violation of her privacy. She
never confessed her violation of his. He never mentioned the missing
letters. 1or did she speak of her missing poems. ThoXgh she never Zrote
another poem, she had Zondered ever since Zhy he had kept these pages of
her poems and Zhy they Zere damp. In her daydreams she sometimes
imagined him reading them and Zeeping over their beaXty. A feZ years

169
ago, her mother phoned to tell her that he had sXffered a massive stroke.
ThoXgh she rXshed to the airport and caXght the ne[t plane home, she
arrived at the hospital only to find his room empty and a bare mattress
covered Zith a clear plastic sheet. 0inXtes earlier, the orderlies had
removed his body.

The first time she had met Dr. /ash, she Zas startled at the antiTXe rolltop
desk in his office. It Zas like her father's, and often dXring her long silences
she caXght herself ga]ing at it. She never told Dr. /ash aboXt the desk and
its secret, or aboXt her poems, or aboXt the long silence betZeen herself and
her father.

Ernest also slept poorly that night. Again and again, he revieZed his
presentation of /inda to the coXntertransference stXdy groXp Zhich had met
a feZ days earlier in one of the member's groXp therapy room on CoXch
5oZ, as Xpper Sacramento Street Zas often called. ThoXgh the seminar had
started leaderless, the discXssions had groZn so intense and so personally
threatening that a feZ months ago they hired a consXltant, Dr. Frit] Werner,
an elderly psychoanalyst Zho had contribXted many astXte papers to the
psychoanalytic literatXre on coXntertransference. Ernest's accoXnt of /inda
had provoked a particXlarly animated discXssion. ThoXgh

praising him for his Zillingness to e[pose himself so candidly to the groXp,
Dr. Werner had also been sharply critical of the therapy, especially the T-
shirt comment.

"Why so impatient?" Dr. Werner had asked, as he scraped the boZl of his
pipe, filled it Zith  acrid smelling Balkan Sobranie, tamped it doZn, and lit
it. When first invited, he had stipXlated that his pipe be part of the deal.

"So she repeats herself?" he continXed. "So she Zhines? So she makes
impossible reTXests of yoX? So she's critical of yoX and doesn't behave like
a good gratefXl patient? 0y God, yoXng man, yoX've only seen her for foXr
months! What's that—a total of fifteen or si[teen sessions? Why, I'm
cXrrently seeing a patient Zho for the entire first year —that's foXr times a
Zeek, tZo hXndred hoXrs —simply repeated herself. 2ver and over, the
same lament, the same yearning for different parents, different friends,
different face, different body—the same endless pining for Zhat coXld

170
never be. EventXally she got fed Xp Zith listening to herself, fed Xp Zith her
oZn repetitive cycle. She herself reali]ed she Zas sTXandering not only her
analytic hoXrs bXt her entire life. YoX can't fling the trXth in yoXr patient's
face: the only real trXth is the trXth Ze discover for oXrselves.

a Evenly sXspended attention, yoXng man," he said firmly. "That's Zhat yoX
need to give the patient. Evenly sXspended attention; Zords as trXe noZ as
Zhen FreXd first Xttered them. "That's Zhat is reTXired of Xs—to attend to
the patient's Zords ZithoXt prefor-mXlations, ZithoXt bias, ZithoXt personal
reactions limiting oXr vision. It's the heart and soXl of the entire analytic
enterprise. 5emove that and the entire process goes bankrXpt."

At that point, the seminar had e[ploded, everyone speaking at once. Dr.
Werner's criticism of Ernest had, like a lightning rod, draZn to itself the
tension that had been bXilding for months. The participants, all eager to
improve their skills, had been irritated by the arrogant elitism they
perceived in their elderly consXltant. They Zere the mXddied shit-splattered
troops Zorking in the trenches. Every day they faced the highly
compromised clini-

10

DoXble E[posXre

cal conditions imposed by the H02  jXggernaXt, and Zere incensed by Dr.
Werner's all too apparent indifference to the realities of their practice. 2ne
of those lXcky ones Zho had been XntoXched by the managed-care debacle,
he accepted no insXrance; he simply continXed his practice of seeing
Zealthy analytic patients foXr times a Zeek, and coXld afford to be leisXrely,
to let the patient's resistance Zear itself doZn. The seminar members
brisded at his Xncompromising endorsement of the hard psychoanalytic
line. And his certainty and smXgness, his XnTXestioning acceptance of
institXtionali]ed dogma: this, too, they resented, Zith the gall and the envy
an[ioXs skeptics have alZays felt toZard cheerfXl believers.

"HoZ can yoX say Ernest has seen her for only foXrteen sessions?" one
asked. "I'm lXcky to have an H02 give me eight visits. And only if  I can
coa[ oXt of my patient one of the magic Zords sXicide, revenge, arson, or

171
homicide—do I have a chance of begging a feZ more sessions from some
clinically Xntrained case manager, Zhose oZn job depends on tXrning doZn
as many sXch reTXests as possible."

And another: "I'm not as sXre as yoX are, Dr. Werner, that Ernest did the
Zrong thing. 0aybe  the T-shirt crack Zasn't a blXnder. 0aybe that's jXst
Zhat this patient needed to hear. We've talked here aboXt the therapy hoXr's
being a microcosm of a patient's life. So if she bores and frXstrates Ernest,
she's XndoXbtedly doing the same to everyone else aroXnd her. 0aybe he's
doing her a favor by letting her knoZ. 0aybe he doesn't have tZo hXndred
hoXrs to let her get impatient Zith herself."

And another: "Sometimes this fine-tXned analytic procedXre is jXst too
mXch, Dr. Werner, jXst too precioXs, too oXt of toXch Zith reality. This
bXsiness of the patient's empathic XnconscioXs alZays picking Xp the
therapist's feelings— I jXst don't bXy it. 0y patients are generally in crisis.
They come in once a Zeek, not foXr times a Zeek like yoXrs, and are too
bXsy choking on their oZn stXff to tXne in to my nXances of mood. This
'XnconscioXs picking Xp the therapist's feelings'—my patients don't have the

time, don't have the desire."

Dr. Werner coXldn't let that remark pass. "I knoZ that this seminar is on
coXntertransference, not on therapy techniTXe, bXt yoX cannot keep them
separate. 2nce a Zeek, seven times a Zeek—it matters not. The handling of
coXntertransference alZays inflXences therapy. At some level, the therapist's
feelings aboXt the patient are invariably transmitted. 9ve never seen it fail!"
He said, Zaving his pipe for emphasis. "And this is Zhy Ze mXst
Xnderstand, and Zork throXgh, and redXce oXr neXrotic responses to
patients.

"BXt, here, in this—this T-shirt instance," Dr. Werner continXed, "Ze're not
even considering nXances, Ze're not dealing Zith the patient's sXbtle
perceptions of the therapist's feelings. Dr. /ash insXlted the patient openly
—no nXanced gXessZork reTXired here. I can't shirk my responsibility to
label that an egregioXs therapeXtic error—an error that threatens the
foXndations of the therapeXtic alliance. Don't let the California ethos of
'anything goes, everything is permitted' contaminate yoXr therapy. Anarchy

172
and therapy are not mXtXally compatible. What is yoXr first step in therapy?
YoX've got to establish a safe frame. HoZ in the Zorld, after this incident,
can Dr. /ash's patient free-associate? HoZ can she trXst the therapist to
consider her Zords Zith evenly sXspended attention?"

"Is evenly sXspended attention possible for any therapist?" asked 5on, a
heavily bearded and intense therapist, and one of Ernest's closest friends,
linked ever since medical school by their mXtXal iconoclasm. "It Zasn't for
FreXd. /ook at his cases—Dora, the rat man, /ittle Hans. He alZays
entered into his patients' lives. I don't believe it's hXmanly possible to
maintain a position of neXtrality—that's Zhat Donald Spence's neZ book
argXes. YoX never really apprehend the patient's real e[perience."

"That doesn't mean yoX give Xp trying to listen ZithoXt letting yoXr
personal feelings contaminate the scene," said Dr. Werner. "The more
neXtral yoX are, the closer yoX appro[imate the patient's original meaning."

12

DoXble E[posXre

"2riginal  meaning? Discovery of another's original meaning is an illXsion,"
5on shot back. "/ook  at the leaky commXnica-tional pathZay. First, some
of the patient's feelings are transformed into their oZn images and then into
their favorite vocabXlary—"

"Why do yoX say some?" asked Dr. Werner.

"BecaXse many of their feelings are ineffable. BXt let me finish. I Zas
talking aboXt the patient's transforming images into Zords: even that
process is not pXre—the choice of Zords is heavily inflXenced by the
individXal's imagined relationship Zith the aXdience. And that's jXst the
transmitting part. Then the reverse has to take place: if therapists are to
grasp the meaning of the patient's Zords, they mXst retranslate the Zords
into their oZn private images and then into their oZn feelings. By the end
of the process, Zhat kind of match is possible? What is the chance that one
person can really Xnderstand the other's e[perience? 2r to pXt it another

173
Zay, that tZo different people Zill  hear another person in the same
manner?"

"It's like that Zord game 'Telephone' Ze played as kids," Ernest chipped in.
"2ne person Zhispers a phrase into another's ear, and that person Zhispers
to another, and so on aroXnd the circle. By the time the phrase retXrns to the
sender, it bears little relationship to the original."

"Which means that listening is not recording, " 5on said, coming doZn hard
on each Zord. "/istening is a creative process. That's Zhy the analytic
pretense that psychoanalysis is a science alZays rankles me. It cannot be a
science, since science demands accXrate measXring of reliable e[ternal data.
In therapy that's not possible, becaXse listening is creative—the therapist's
mind distorts as it measXres."

"We all knoZ Ze err," Ernest gleefXlly charged in, "Xnless Ze're silly
enoXgh to believe in immacXlate perception? Since reading that phrase
someZhere a feZ Zeeks before, he had been jXst itching to Xse it in
conversation.

Dr. Werner, never one to shrink from a debate, Zas Xnfa]ed by his stXdents'
barrage, and responded confidently, "Don't be blinded

by the false goal of absolXte identity betZeen speaker's thoXghts and
listener's perceptions. The best Ze can hope for is mere appro[imation. BXt,
tell me," he asked, "is there anyone here, even my iconoclastic
.at]enjammer  dXo"- nodding toZard 5on and Ernest— "Zho doXbts that a
Zell integrated individXal is more likely to apprehend accXrately a speaker's
intent than, let Xs say, a paranoid individXal Zho reads portents of personal
danger into every commXnication? 3ersonally, I believe Ze're selling
oXrselves short Zith this breast-beating lament aboXt oXr inability to really
knoZ the other or to reconstrXct the other's past. This hXmility has led yoX,
Dr. /ash, into the dXbioXs practice of focXsing e[clXsively on the here-and-
noZ."

"HoZ so?" Ernest asked coolly.

174
"BecaXse yoX, of all oXr participants, are most skeptical aboXt accXrate
recall and the entire process of reconstrXcting a patient's past. And I think
yoX carry it so far that yoX confXse yoXr patient. Yes, the past is
XndoXbtedly elXsive, and XndoXbtedly shifts according to a patient's mood,
and XndoXbtedly oXr theoretical beliefs inflXence Zhat one recalls, bXt I still
believe that Xnderneath it all there is a valid sXbte[t, a trXe ansZer to the
TXestion 'Did my brother hit me Zhen I Zas three?'"

"A valid sXbte[t is an antiTXated illXsion," Ernest retorted. "There is no
valid ansZer to that TXestion. Its conte[t—Zhether he hit yoX pXrposefXlly
or playfXlly, or gave yoX a mere tap or a knockoXt pXnch—is lost forever."

"5ight,"  5on cXt in. "2r  Zhether he hit yoX in self-defense— in response to
yoXr hitting him a moment before? 2r in defense of yoXr sister? 2r becaXse
he had jXst been pXnished by 0other for something yoX did?"

"There is no valid sXbte[t, "Ernest repeated. "It's all interpretation. As
1iet]sche kneZ  a centXry ago."

"Aren't Ze straying from the intent of this conference?" interrXpted Barbara,
one of the groXp's tZo Zoman members. "/ast time I looked, it Zas called a
coXntertransference seminar." She tXrned to Dr. Werner. "I'd like to make a
process comment.

14

DoXble E[posXre

Ernest does e[actly Zhat Ze're sXpposed to do in this seminar— report on
his innermost feelings to his patient—and then gets blasted for it. HoZ
come?"

"5ight, right!"  said Dr. Werner, the gleam in his blXe-gray eye sXggesting
that he relished the Xprising, the spectacle of groZn siblings sXspending
their rivalry and Xniting in a joint patricidal campaign. In fact, he loved it.
By God, he Zas thinking, jXst imagine! FreXd's primal horde alive and
rampaging right here on Sacramento Street! For a moment, he considered

175
offering this interpretation to the groXp bXt thoXght better of it. The children
Zeren't ready for it yet. 0aybe later.

Instead, he responded, "BXt keep in mind, I Zas not critical of Dr. /ash's
feelings aboXt 0s. /inda.  What therapist Zho has ever lived has not had
sXch thoXghts aboXt an irritating patient? 1o, I do not critici]e his thoXght. I
critici]e  only his lack of restraint, his need to let her knoZ hoZ he felt."

That triggered another roXnd of protests. Some defended Ernest's decision
to e[press his feelings openly. 2thers critici]ed Dr. Werner for not bXilding
a trXsting environment in the seminar. They Zanted to feel safe there. They
most definitely did not Zant to dodge broadsides aboXt their therapeXtic
techniTXe, especially Zhen the critiTXe Zas based on a traditional analytic
approach inappropriate to their cXrrent clinical setting.

Finally, Ernest himself sXggested that the discXssion Zas no longer
prodXctive, and Xrged the groXp to retXrn to the topic of his
coXntertransference. A feZ members then spoke of similar patients Zho had
drained and bored them bXt Barbara's comment most piTXed Ernest's
interest.

"This is not like any other resistant patient," she said. "YoX say she gets to
yoX like no one else, and that yoX've never been so disrespectfXl to a patient
before."

"It's trXe, and I'm not sXre Zhy," Ernest responded. "Several things aboXt
her tick me off. I get infXriated at her persistent reminders of the money
she's paying me. She is constandy tXrning this process into a commercial
transaction."

"It's not a commercial transaction?" interposed Dr. Werner. "Since Zhen?
YoX give her a service, and in retXrn she gives yoX a check. /ooks like
commerce to me."

"Well, parishioners tithe, bXt that doesn't make a chXrch service an act of
commerce," said Ernest.

176
"2h, yes, it does! insisted Dr. Werner. "The circXmstances are jXst more
refined and concealed. 5ead the genteel fine print at the end of a prayer
book: no tithing, eventXally no service."

"Typical analytic redXctionism, everything redXced to its basest level," said
Ernest. "I'm not bXying in. Therapy is not commerce, nor am I a merchant.
That's not Zhy I'm in the field. If  money Zere Xppermost, I'd have gone into
something else—laZ, investment banking, even one of the rich medical
specialties, like ophthalmology or radiology. I see therapy as something else
—call it an act of caritas. I signed Xp for a life of service. For Zhich I also,
incidentally, happen to get paid. BXt this patient keeps slapping me in the
face Zith the money."

"YoX give and give," Dr. Werner pXrred in his most professional, sonoroXs
voice, appearing to relent. "BXt she gives nothing back."

Ernest nodded. "5ight! She gives nothing back."

"YoX give and give," repeated Dr. Werner. "YoX give her yoXr best stXff and
she keeps saying, 'Give me something ZorthZhile.'"

"That's e[actly the Zay it feels," said Ernest, more softly.

This e[change happened so smoothly that none of the seminar members,
perhaps not even Dr. Werner himself, had been conscioXs of his sZitch into
his sedXctive professional voice—or, it seemed, of Ernest's eagerness to
snXggle into the Zarmth of the therapeXtic comforter.

"YoX said there's something of yoXr mother in it," remarked Barbara.

"I never got mXch good stXff from her, either."

"Does her ghost inflXence yoXr feelings toZard /inda?"

"It Zas different Zith  my mother. I Zas the one Zho kept pXlling aZay. I
Zas embarrassed by her. I didn't like thinking I Zas

16

born of her. When I Zas yoXng—maybe eight, nine—I felt sXffocated Zhen
my mother got too close to me. I remember telling my analyst that my
mother 'sXcked Xp all the o[ygen in the room.' That phrase became a
slogan, a major motif, of my analysis: my analyst referred to it again and
again. I Xsed to look at my mother and think, I have to love her as my
mother bXt, if she Zere a stranger, I'd dislike everything aboXt her."

"So," said Dr. Werner, "noZ Ze knoZ something important aboXt yoXr
coXntertransference. AlthoXgh yoX invite yoXr patient to come closer, yoX
Xnintentionally give her a simXltaneoXs 'Don't get too close' message. She'll
intrXde too far, sXck Xp all the o[ygen. And ZithoXt a doXbt she's
perceiving this second message and accommodating yoX. Again, let me
repeat, Ze can't hide these feeling from patients. I'll say it once again, Ze
can't hide these feeling from patients. It's the lesson for today. I cannot
emphasi]e the point too strongly. 1o e[perienced therapist can possibly
doXbt the e[istence of XnconscioXs empathy."

"/ot  of ambivalence, too," said Barbara, "in yoXr se[Xal feelings toZard
her. I'm strXck by yoXr response to her breasts—both longing and repXlsion.
YoX like those bloXse bXttons popping, bXt they bring Xp Xnpleasant
memories of 0other."

"Yes," added Tom, another of Ernest's close friends, "and then yoX get self-
conscioXs, start to TXestion Zhether yoX may have XnZittingly been staring
at her breasts. Happens to me often."

"And yoXr se[Xal attraction to her coXpled Zith a Zish to get aZay? What
do yoX make of it?" asked Barbara.

"Some dark primitive vagina dentate fantasy in me, no doXbt," replied
Ernest. "BXt still there's something in this patient that particXlarly ignites
that fear."

-Xst before drifting off to sleep, Ernest Zondered again Zhether he shoXld
stop seeing /inda. 0aybe she needs a female therapist. 0aybe my negative
feelings are too deep, too entrenched. BXt Zhen he had raised that TXestion

178
in the seminar groXp, everyone, inclXding Dr. Werner, said, "1o, stay the
coXrse." /inda's major problems, they felt, Zere Zith men and coXld best be
addressed Zith a

male therapist. Too bad, Ernest thoXght: he really Zanted oXt.

Yet, he Zondered, Zhat aboXt that strange session today? AlthoXgh as
obno[ioXs as ever in most Zays, inclXding her reference to his fee, /inda
had at least acknoZledged his presence in the room. She had challenged
him, asked him Zhether he liked her, taken him to task aboXt the sarcastic
T-shirt comment. E[haXsting—bXt, at least, something different, something
real, Zas happening.

2n her drive to the ne[t session, /inda listened again to Dr. /ash's hatefXl
dictation and then to the tape of the last session. 1ot bad, she thoXght—she
liked the Zay she had held her oZn in the last session. She enjoyed making
the sXcker Zork for his money. HoZ delicioXs that he Zas Xnsettled by her
barbs aboXt his fee: I'll make sXre, she resolved, to give him a sharp money-
jab each session. The long drive ]ipped by.

'Yesterday at Zork," /inda began the hoXr, "I Zas sitting in the lavatory and
overheard some girls at the sink talking aboXt me."

"2h? What did yoX hear?" Ernest Zas alZays intrigXed by the drama of
overhearing yoXrself being discXssed.

"Things I didn't like. That I'm obsessed Zith earning money. That I talk
aboXt nothing else, have no other interests. That I'm boring and hard to be
Zith."

"2h, terrible!  HoZ painfXl that mXst have been."

"Yeah, I felt betrayed by someone I thoXght cared for me. .icked in the
stomach."

"Betrayed? What sort of relationship had yoX had Zith them?"

"Well, they'd pretended to like me, to care aboXt me, be my friends."

179
"HoZ aboXt others in yoXr office? HoZ do they feel aboXt yoX?"

"If yoX don't mind, Dr. /ash, I've been thinking aboXt Zhat yoX've been
saying aboXt staying here in this office. YoX knoZ, focXsing on oXr
relationship. I'd like to try that."

"AbsolXtely." A look of astonishment crossed Ernest's face. He coXldn't
believe his ears.

18

"So, let me ask yoX," said /inda, crossing her legs Zith a loXd sZish of her
stockings, "do yoX feel that Zay aboXt me?"

"What Zay?" stalled Ernest.

"What I jXst said. Do yoX find me narroZ? Boring? Hard to be Zith?"

"I never feel jXst one Zay aboXt yoX, or anyone. It varies."

"Well, let's say in genera9 said /inda, Zho Zas clearly not aboXt to be
deterred.

Ernest felt his moXth go dry. He tried to sZalloZ sXrreptitioXsly. "Well, let
me pXt it this Zay. When yoX avoid me, Zhen yoX talk in a repetitioXs Zay
aboXt certain things—for e[ample, yoXr stock options or yoXr ongoing
conflict Zith  yoXr CE2 at Zork—that's Zhen I  feel less in toXch Zith yoX.
'/ess engaged' is the better term."

"/ess engaged? Isn't that shrink code for 'boring'?"

"8h, no—I  mean, boring in a social sitXation doesn't really pertain to the
therapy sitXation. The patient—I mean yoX —isn't here to entertain me. I'm
focXsing on hoZ my patient interacts Zith me and others so that—"

"BXt sXrely," she interrXpted, "yoX find some patients boring."

180
"Well," said Ernest, pXlling oXt a .leene[ from  the bo[ on his side table
and padding it in his palms, "I'm e[amining my feelings all the time, and if
I'm—Xh—less engaged—"

"Bored, yoX mean?"

"Well, in a Zay. If I  feel—Xh— distant from a patient, I don't think of that
as a jXdgment. I think of that feeling as data, and I try to find oXt Zhat's
happening betZeen Xs."

Ernest's attempt to dry his palms had not escaped /inda. Good, she thoXght.
2ne-fifty-an-hoXr sZeat "And today? Am I  boring yoX today?"

"1oZ?  I can absolXtely say that yoX are not boring or hard to be Zith today.
I feel engaged. A little threatened. Trying to stay open and not defensive.
1oZ, yoX tell me Zhat yoX're e[perienc-ing."

"Well, it's okay today."

"'2kay'? CoXld yoX be a little more vagXe?"

"What?"

"Sorry, /inda.  A poor attempt at hXmor. I'm trying to say that I feel like
yoX're evasive and holding back Zhat yoX're e[perienc-ing."

The hoXr Zas Xp, and as she rose to leave, /inda said, "I can tell yoX one
other thing I'm e[periencing."

"Yes?"

"I'm a little Zorried  that I'm pXshing yoX too hard. 0aking yoX Zork too
mXch."

"So? What's Zrong Zith my Zorking  too hard?"

"I don't Zant yoX raising my rates."

"See yoX ne[t Zeek, /inda."

181
Ernest spent the evening reading bXt felt fatigXed and preoccXpied. ThoXgh
he had seen eight patients that day, he spent more time thinking aboXt /inda
than aboXt the other seven combined.

That evening /inda felt fXll  of energy. After sXrfing Internet dating services
and then lXrking in a singles chat room, she phoned and had a long
satisfying conversation Zith her sister, to Zhom she hadn't spoken for
months.

When she finally fell asleep, /inda dreamed that she Zas holding a sXitcase
and staring oXt the ZindoZ. A bi]arre ta[icab drives Xp—a jolly, boXncy,
cartoon cab. 2n its door is Zritten "The FreXd Ta[i Company." 0oments
later, she Zatches the letters change to "The FraXd Ta[i Company."

Despite her ZoXnded feelings and her distrXst of Ernest, therapy had
become more interesting for /inda; even dXring her Zorking hoXrs, she
foXnd herself anticipating the Xpcoming session.

The ploy aboXt having overheard a conversation in the lavatory Zorked
Zell, she thoXght, and she intended to continXe inventing devices that
ZoXld alloZ her to Xse some part of the overheard dictation each hoXr. 1e[t
Zeek it ZoXld be his label of "Zhining."

180

DoXble E[posXre

"0y  sister told me on the phone the other day," she said disingenXoXsly,
"that my parents often called me '0iss Whiner' Zhen I Zas small. That hits
home somehoZ. YoX said I shoXld try to Xse this safe place here in yoXr
office to e[plore things I can't talk aboXt elseZhere."

Ernest nodded vigoroXsly.

"So I Zas Zondering Zhether yoX think I Zhine a lot."

"What do yoX mean by 'Zhine,' /inda?"

182
"Well, yoX knoZ—complain, speak in a Zhiny voice, talk in a Zay that
makes people Zant to get aZay from me. Do I?"

"What do yoX think, /inda?"

"I don't think so. And yoXr opinion?"

8nable to procrastinate indefinitely, or to lie, or to tell the trXth, Ernest
sTXirmed. "If by 'Zhine' yoX mean yoX tend to complain aboXt yoXr
sitXation repetitively and XnprodXctively—then, yes, I've heard yoX do
that."

"An e[ample, please."

"I promise to ansZer that," said Ernest, deciding it Zas time for a process
comment, "bXt let me say something first, /inda. I'm strXck by the change
in yoX these last Zeeks. It's been so fast. YoX aZare of it?"

"Change hoZ?"

"HoZ? In almost in every Zay. /ook  at Zhat yoX're doing— yoX're direct,
focXsed, challenging. /ike yoX say, yoX're keeping it in the room, yoX're
talking aboXt Zhat's taking place betZeen Xs."

"And that's good?"

"It's great, /inda. I'm  delighted to see it. To be honest, there Zere times in
the past Zhen I felt yoX hardly noticed I Zas in the room Zith yoX. When I
say it's great, I mean yoX're moving in the right direction. BXt still yoX seem
so—Zhat shoXld I say? So onesided, so—Zell, acerbic, as thoXgh yoX're
continXally angry Zith me. Ami off  base?"

"I don't feel angry Zith yoX, jXst frXstrated Zith my Zhole life. BXt yoX said
yoX'd give me e[amples of my Zhining."

SXddenly this Zoman Zho had been too sloZ for him Zas

becoming almost too fast. Ernest had to concentrate all his attention on their
discoXrse.

183
"1ot  so fast. I'm not bXying into that Zord, /inda. I feel yoX're trying to
brand me Zith it. I said 'repetitioXs,' and I'll give yoX an e[ample of that:
yoXr feelings aboXt yoXr CE2. HoZ he's not efficient, hoZ he shoXld make
the company leaner, hoZ he shoXld fire incompetent Zorkers, hoZ his soft-
heartedness is going to cost yoX big money in yoXr stock options—that's the
land of thing I mean. YoX've discXssed this over and over again, hoXr after
hoXr. -Xst like yoXr comments aboXt the dating scene—yoX knoZ Zhat I
mean. DXring those hoXrs I've ended Xp feeling less engaged Zith yoX and
less helpfXl as Zell."

"BXt those are the things that preoccXpy me—yoX tell me to share Zhat I'm
thinking."

"YoX're absolXtely right, /inda. I knoZ it's a dilemma, bXt it's not Zhat yoX
say bXt hoZ yoX say it. BXt I don't Zant to detract from my earlier point.
The mere fact that Ze're talking so openly sXpports Zhat I said a little Zhile
ago—that yoX're different, Zorking better and harder in therapy.

"It's time to stop for today, bXt let's try to pick Xp from here ne[t Zeek. 2h,
yes, here's the bill for last month."

"Hmmm," said /inda,  Xncrossing her legs, not neglecting to sZish them
vigoroXsly, and scanning the proffered bill before dropping it into her pXrse.
"HoZ disappointing!"

"What do yoX mean?"

"Still one-fifty  an hoXr. 1o discoXnts for being a better patient?"

The folloZing  Zeek, as she listened yet again to Ernest's coXn-
tertransference dictation on the Zay to her therapy hoXr, /inda decided to
steer the discXssion to his comments aboXt her physical appearance and
se[Xal attractiveness. It Zasn't difficXlt.

"/ast  Zeek," she began, "yoX said Ze shoXld continXe Zhere Ze left off."

"All  right. Where shall Ze start?"

184
"At the end of the session last Zeek, yoX Zere talking aboXt my Zhining
aboXt the singles scene—"

182

DoXble E[posXre

"Whoa! YoX keep TXoting me as thoXgh I said yoX Zere Zhining. That Zas
not my Zord—repeat, not my Zord. I said something aboXt yoXr circXlar or
repetitioXs comments."

/inda,  of coXrse, kneZ better. 'Whining' Zas precisely his term: she had jXst
heard him Xse it on the tape. BXt eager to proceed, she'd let him have his
little lie.

"YoX Zere saying yoX Zere bored by my talking aboXt the singles scene.
HoZ am I sXpposed to deal Zith it, if I don't talk aboXt it?"

"Certainly yoX've got to talk aboXt the major concerns in yoXr life. As I
said, it's boZ yoX talk aboXt them."

"What does 'hoZ' mean?"

"Well, yoX didn't seem to be speaking to me. I felt oXt of the loop. Time and
again, yoX'd tell me the e[act same things—the Xnfair ratio, the meat
market scene, the ten-second visXal checkoXt in singles bars, the
impersonality of Internet matching services. And each time yoX'd say it as
thoXgh yoX Zere telling me for the first time, as thoXgh yoX'd never thoXght
of asking yoXrself Zhether yoX'd ever said this before or hoZ I might regard
yoXr repeating it so often."

Silence. /inda stared at the floor.

"What do yoX feel aboXt Zhat I jXst said?"

"I'm digesting it. Tastes a little bitter. Sorry I Zasn't more considerate."

"/inda,  I'm not jXdging yoX. It's good that the issXe has come Xp, and it's
good that I gave yoX feedback. That's hoZ Ze learn."

185
"Hard to think of others Zhen yoX're feeling trapped, feeling yoX're
spinning in a vicioXs circle."

"YoX're going to stay in the vicioXs circle as long as yoX keep dXnking it's
alZays someone else's faXlt. YoXr incompetent CE2, say, or the dating
scene being a jXngle, or the people in marketing being jerks. I'm not saying
these things aren't trXe; I'm saying"— Ernest gave it all he had, emphasi]ing
each Zord forcefXlly—"/ can't help yoX Zith them. The only Zay I can help
yoX break the vicioXs circle is to focXs on Zhatever it is in yoX that might
initiate

or aggravate these happenings."

"I go into a singles event, and there are ten Zomen for each gXy," /inda
spoke more hesitantly, the steam going oXt of her Zords, "and yoX Zant me
to focXs on my responsibility for that?"

"Wait! Stop action, /inda!  Here Ze are again, back in that space. /isten to
me. I do not disagree—the dating sitXation is roXgh. Hear me, / do not
disagree. BXt oXr job is to help yoX make changes in yoXrself that might
make the sitXation better. /ook, I'll pXt it straight. YoX're an intelligent and
attractive Zoman, very attractive. If yoX Zeren't tied Xp by distXrbing
feelings—like resentment and anger, fear and competitiveness—then yoX'd
have no troXble meeting a sXitable man."

/inda  felt shaken by Dr. /ash's blXntness. AlthoXgh she kneZ she shoXld
stay and respond to his point, she persisted in her agenda. "YoX've never
said anything before aboXt my being attractive."

"YoX don't consider yoXrself attractive?"

"Sometimes, sometimes not. BXt I don't get mXch affirmation from men. I
coXld Xse some direct feedback from yoX."

Ernest paXsed. HoZ mXch to say? .noZing he'd have to repeat his Zords to
the coXntertransference seminar in a feZ Zeeks gave him paXse. "I have a
hXnch that if men aren't responding to yoX, it's not becaXse of yoXr physical
appearance."

186
"If yoX Zere single, ZoXld yoX respond to my physical appearance?"

"Same TXestion, I've already ansZered that. -Xst a minXte ago I said that
yoX Zere an attractive Zoman. So, tell me, Zhat are yoX really asking
noZ?"

"1o, I'm  asking a different TXestion. YoX say I'm attractive, bXt yoX haven't
said Zhether yoX ZoXld respond to my attractiveness."

"5espond?"

"Dr. /ash, yoX're hedging. I think yoX knoZ Zhat I mean. If yoX had met
me not as a patient bXt in some singles sitXation, then Zhat? WoXld yoX
check me oXt in ten seconds and then Zalk aZay? 2r flirt Zith me, or
maybe go for a one-night stand, planning to disap-

pear afterZard?"

"Can Ze take a look at Zhat's going on betZeen Xs today. YoX're really
pXtting me on the spot. HoZ come? What's yoXr payoff for that? What's
going on inside, /inda?"

"BXt aren't I doing Zhat yoX've said I shoXld be doing, Dr. /ash? Talking
aboXt oXr relationship, aboXt the here-and-noZ?"

"I agree. 1o TXestion, things have changed here—and for the better. I feel
better aboXt the Zay Ze're Zorking, and I hope yoX do, too."

Silence. /inda refXsed to meet Ernest's ga]e.

"I hope yoX do, too," Ernest tried again.

/inda  nodded, ever so slighdy.

187
"YoX see? YoXr nod, that microscopic, that embryonic nod! Three
millimeters, at best. That's Zhat I mean. I coXld hardly see it. It's as thoXgh
yoX Zant to give me as little as possible. That's Zhat pX]]les me. It seems
to me that yoX're primarily asking, not talking, aboXt oXr relationship.

"BXt yoX said—and said it more than once—that the first stage of change
Zas getting feedback."

"Getting and assimilating feedback. 5ight. BXt in oXr last feZ hoXrs yoX've
jXst been collecting feedback—more of a TXestion-and-ansZer format. I
mean, I give yoX feedback, and yoX then proceed to another TXestion."

"5ather than?"

"5ather than a lot of things. For e[ample, rather than tXrning inZard to
consider and discXss and digest the meaning of the feedback. HoZ it felt,
Zhether or not it rang trXe, Zhat it stirred Xp inside, hoZ yoX felt aboXt my
saying it to yoX."

"Well, okay. To be honest, I'm really sXrprised to hear yoX say yoX find me
attractive. YoX don't act that Zay toZard me."

"I do think yoX're attractive, bXt here, in this office, I'm more interested in a
deeper meeting Zith yoX: Zith yoXr essence, Zith yoXr—I knoZ it soXnds
corny—bXt Zith yoXr soXl."

"0aybe  I shoXldn't persist"—/inda felt  the energy going oXt of her
TXestion—"bXt my physical appearance is important to me,

and I'm still cXrioXs aboXt hoZ yoX e[perience me—Zhat featXres aboXt my
appearance are attractive to yoX, and that other TXestion aboXt Zhat might
have happened if Ze had met socially rather than professionally?"

I'm being crXcified, Ernest Zhimpered to himself. His Zorst nightmare
aboXt the here-and-noZ had come to pass. He had played oXt all his options.
He alZays feared that one day he ZoXld be cornered like this. The typical
therapist ZoXld, of coXrse, not ansZer the TXestion, bXt ZoXld reflect it
back to her and e[plore all its implications: Why do yoX ask this TXestion?

188
And Zhy noZ? And  Zhat Zere yoXr Xnderlying fantasies? HoZ ZoXld yoX
Zant me to respond?

BXt this option Zas not available for Ernest. Having based his therapeXtic
approach sTXarely on aXthentic engagement, he coXldn't abandon it noZ and
tXrn back to convention. 1othing else to do noZ bXt clXtch to his faith and
dive into the cold pool of trXth.

"3hysically, yoX're attractive in every Zay—pretty face, ZonderfXl glossy
hair, terrific figXre—"

"By 'figXre,' yoX mean my breasts?" interrXpted /inda, arching her back
ever so slightly.

"Well, yes, everything—yoXr carriage—grooming—slim— everything."

"Sometimes it seems yoX stare at my breasts—or at my bloXse bXttons."
/inda  felt a flXsh of pity, and added, "A lot of men do."

"If I  do, I'm not aZare of it," said Ernest. Too flXstered to do Zhat he kneZ
he shoXld have done—encoXrage her to e[press in depth her feelings aboXt
her appearance, inclXding her breasts— he tried to scramble back to safe
groXnd. "BXt, as I said, I do think of yoX as an attractive Zoman."

"Does that mean yoX might come on to me—I mean in this hypothetical

"Well, I'm not in the singles Zorld—been in a relationship for a Zhile—bXt
if I project myself back to that era, I'd say yoX'd pass all my physical
criteria. BXt some of the other things Ze've been

discXssing ZoXld give me paXse."

"SXch as?"

189
"SXch as Zhat's happening right here, right noZ, /inda. /isten hard to Zhat
I'm going to say. YoX're collecting and hoarding. YoX're accXmXlating
information from me, bXt yoX're not giving anything back! I believe yoX're
trying to relate to me differently noZ, bXt I'm not e[periencing it as
engagement. I don't feel yet that yoX're relating to me as a person—it's more
like yoX regard me as a data bank from Zhich yoX make ZithdraZals."

"YoX mean I'm not relating becaXse of my Zhining?"

"1o, that's not Zhat I said. 1oZ,  /inda,  oXr time is Xp today, and Ze've got
to stop, bXt Zhen yoX play the tape of this session I'd like yoX to listen
carefXlly to Zhat I jXst said to yoX a minXte ago aboXt hoZ yoX're relating
to me. I think it's the most important thing I've ever said to yoX."

After the session, /inda Zasted no time pXtting in the cassette and
folloZing  Ernest's instrXctions. Starting Zith "9d say yoX'd pass all my
physical criteria, " she listened intently.

BXt some of the other things Ze've been discXssing ZoXld give me paXse. . .
. /isten hard to Zhat I'm going to say. YoX're collecting and hoarding.
YoX're accXmXlating information . .. bXt yoX're not giving anything back! ...
I don't feel yet that yoX're relating to me as a person—it's more like yoX

play the tape of this session I'd like yoX to listen carefXlly to Zhat I jXst said
to yoX ... I think it's the most important thing I've ever said to yoX."

SZitching cassettes, /inda listened to the coXntertransference dictation
again. Certain phrases strXck home: "she Zill not relate to me and she Zill
not acknoZledge that she doesn '? and insists its not relevant anyZay. . . .
HoZ many goddamn times do I have to e[plain Zhy its important to look at
oXr relationship? . . . Does everything possible to eliminate any shred of
closeness betZeen Xs. 1othing I do is good enoXgh for her. . . no tenderness
. . . too self-focXsed. . . Xngiving. "

3erhaps Dr. /ash is right, she thoXght, I really never have

thoXght aboXt him, his life, his e[perience. BXt I can change that. Today.
5ight noZ  as I drive home.

190
BXt she coXldn't stay focXsed more than a minXte or tZo. To still her mind,
she tXrned to a XsefXl mind-TXieting techniTXe she had learned a feZ years
before at a Big SXr meditation Zeekend (Zhich Zas in most other Zays a
rip-off). .eeping   one part of her mind on the highZay, Zith the rest she
imagined a broom sZeeping oXt every stray thoXght that popped in. That
done, she concentrated only on her breathing, on the inhalation of cool air
and on the e[halation of the air slightly heated in the nest of her lXngs.

Good. Her mind TXieter noZ, she alloZed Dr. /ash's face to appear, first
smiling and attentive, then froZning and tXrning aZay. 2ver the last several
Zeeks, ever since she had overheard his dictation, her feelings toZard him
had gyrated Zildly. 2ne thing I have to say for him, she thoXght, he's
persistent. I've had the poor gXy on the ropes for Zeeks noZ. 0aking him
sZeat. Belting him again and again Zith his oZn Zords. Yet he's taking his
licks. Hanging in there. Doesn't throZ in the toZel. And no Zeasel in him:
no slinking, no crooked tZists and tXrns, no trying to He his Zay oXt as I'd
have done. 2h, maybe a little fibbing, like denying he said "Zhining." BXt
maybe he Zas jXst trying to spare me pain.

/inda  came oXt of her reverie jXst in time to take the 380 tXrnoff and then
effortlessly slipped back into fantasy. Wonder Zhat Dr. /ash's doing noZ?
Dictating? 0aking  notes of oXr session? Storing them in one of the desk
compartments. 2r maybe he's jXst sitting at his desk thinking of me this
very minXte. That desk. Daddy's desk. Is Daddy thinking of me noZ?
0aybe he's still someZhere, maybe Zatching me noZ. 1o, Daddy is dXst.
Bare shiny skXll. Heap of dXst. And all his thoXghts aboXt me— dXst, too.
And his memories, his loves, his hates, his discoXragement—all dXst. 1o,
less than dXst—they Zere jXst electromagnetic blips long vanished ZithoXt
a trace. I knoZ Daddy mXst have loved me— told everyone else he did—
told AXnt Greet, AXnt /ean, 8ncle -oe— bXt he coXldn't say it to me. If
only I

188

DoXble E[posXre

coXld have heard his Zords.

191
3Xlling off the highZay, /inda  parked at a lookoXt Zith a vieZ stretching
over the valley from San -ose all the Zay to San Francisco. She glanced
XpZard throXgh her Zindshield. What a sky today, she mXsed. A big sky.
The Zords—Zhat Zords to describe it? SZeeping—majestic—cloXd
layered. 3ellXcid cloXd ribbons. 1o, diaphanoXs. Better—I love that Zord.
DiaphanoXs— diaphanoXs cloXd ribbons. 2r maybe a screen of flXted
cloXds— cloXds like Zhite-bXtter-sand rippled by gentle Zind Zaves? 1ice.
1ice. I like  that.

She reached for a pen and jotted doZn the lines on the back of a pink dry-
cleaning receipt she foXnd in the glove compartment. Starting her car, she
prepared to drive on, then tXrned off the ignition, and thoXght some more.

BXt sXppose Daddy had said the Zords? "/inda, I love yoX — /inda, yoX
fill  me Zith pride—love yoX—love yoX—/inda,  yoX are the best—the best
daXghter a man ever had." What then? Still dXst. Words decay even faster
than brains.

And so Zhat if he never said them? Did anyone ever say them to him? His
parents? 1ever. The stories I heard of them—that boXrbon-gX]]ling father
Zho died salloZ and silen,t and his mother encoring tZice Zith marriages to
other alcoholics. And me? Did I ever say those Zords to him? Have I ever
said them to anyone?

/inda  shivered, yanking herself oXt of her reverie. HoZ Xnlike her it Zas—
these thoXghts. The langXage, the search for beaXtifXl Zords. And the
memories of her father? That, too, Zas strange: she rarely visited him in her
mind. And Zhere Zas her resolve to concentrate on Dr. /ash?

She tried again. For a moment she imagined him sitting at his rolltop desk,
bXt then another image from the past sXperimposed itself. /ate at night. She
shoXld have long been asleep. Tiptoeing doZn the hall. A crack of light
streaming from Xnder her parents' door. Soft intimate voices. Her name
mXrmXred. "/inda." They ZoXld be lvinsr Xnder the thick, doZnv
comforter. 3illoZ  talk.

Talk aboXt her. She flattened on the floor, scrXnching her cheek against the
icy beet-red linoleXm, straining to see Xnder the door, to hear her parents'

192
secret Zords aboXt her.

And noZ, she thoXght, glancing at her Walkman, I've captXred the secret; I
oZn the Zords. Those Zords at the end of the session—Zhat Zere they
again? She slipped in the cassette, reZoXnd for a feZ seconds, and listened:

. . . /inda. /isten  hard to Zhat I'm going to say. YoX're collecting and
hoarding. YoX're accXmXlating information from me, bXt yoX're not giving
anything back: I believe yoX're trying to relate to me differently noZ bXt I'm
not e[periencing it as engagement: I don't feel yet that yoX're relating to me
as a person—it's more like yoX regard me as a data bank from Zhich yoX
make ZithdraZals."

"0aking  ZithdraZals  from a data bank." She nodded. 0aybe he's right.

She started her car, eased back onto 101 SoXth freeZay.

/inda  sat in silence at the beginning of the ne[t session. Impatient as
alZays, Ernest tried to prod her: "Where have yoXr thoXghts been these last
feZ minXtes?"

"I think I've been Zondering hoZ yoX'll begin the session."

"What ZoXld be yoXr preference, /inda? If a genie granted yoXr Zish, hoZ
ZoXld yoX like me to start? WTiat's the perfect statement or TXestion?"

"YoX might say, 'Hello, /inda, I'm really glad to see yoX.'"

"Hello, /inda,  I'm really  glad to see yoX today," Ernest immediately
repeated, concealing his astonishment at /inda's response. In past meetings
Zith her, sXch clever opening gambits had invariably flopped, and he had
throZn oXt his TXestion noZ Zith little hope of sXccess. What a marvel that
she had become so aXdacioXs! And that he Zas really glad to see her—that
Zas even more of a marvel.

"Thank yoX. That Zas nice of yoX, even thoXgh yoX didn't do it perfectly."

"HXh?"

193
190

DoXble E[posXre

"YoX stXck in an e[tra Zord," /inda  said. "The Zord 'today.'"

"The implications being ... ?"

"5emember Dr. /ash, hoZ yoX alZays Xsed to say to me, 'a TXestion ain't a
TXestion if yoX knoZ the ansZer.'"

"YoX're right, bXt hXmor me. 5emember, /inda, sometimes a therapist has
special conversational privileges."

"Well, it seems clear to me that 'today' implies yoX often haven't been glad
to see me."

Is it only recently, Ernest thoXght, that I considered /inda an interpersonal
retard?

"Go on," he said smiling. "Why ZoXld I not Zant to see yoX?"

She hesitated. This Zas not the direction she Zanted the hoXr to take.

"Try. Try to speak to that TXestion, /inda. Why do yoX think I'm not alZays
glad to see yoX? -Xst free-associate, say anything that comes to yoXr mind."

Silence. She felt Zords stirring, Zelling Xp. She tried to pick and choose, to
contain them, bXt there Zere too many Zords, all poXring TXickly into her
mind.

"Why are yoX not glad to see me?" she erXpted. "Why? I knoZ Zhy.
BecaXse I'm indelicate and vXlgar and have bad taste, and—" I don't Zant to
do this, she thoXght, bXt coXldn't stop, compelled to bXrst the boil, to
cleanse the space betZeen them, "and becaXse I'm rigid and narroZ and
never say anything beaXtifXl or poetic!" EnoXgh, enoXgh! she told herself,
trying to clamp her teeth shXt, to lock her jaZs. BXt the Zords noZ Zelled
Xp into a force she coXld not resist, and she vomited them oXt: "And I'm not
soft, and men Zant to get aZay from me—too many sharp angles, elboZs,

194
knees—and I'm too XngratefXl, and I pollXte oXr relationship by talking
aboXt the bill, and—and—" She stopped for a moment and then finished
Zith a Zhimsical  note, "And my tits are too big." E[haXsted, she sank back
in her chair. Everything had been said.

Ernest Zas stXnned. 1oZ it Zas he Zho sat speechless. Those Zords— his
Zords. Where had thev come from? He looked at

/inda,  Zho Zas bent over, holding her head in her hands. HoZ to respond?
His head sZam; he had an impish impXlse to say, "YoXr tits aren't too big."
BXt, thank God, he didn't. Bantering Zas not called for. He kneZ that he
needed to take /inda's Zords Zith the greatest possible serioXsness and
respect. He snatched at the life vest that, in the stormiest of seas, therapists
alZays have available: process commentary, that is to comment on the
process, the relationship implications, of the patient's Xtterance rather than
on its content.

"/ot  of emotion in yoXr Zords, /inda,"  he said TXietly. "SoXnds like yoX've
Zanted to say them for a long time."

"I gXess so." /inda took a coXple of deep breaths. "The Zords had a life of
their oZn. They Zanted to come oXt."

"A bXshel of anger there toZard me—maybe toZard both of Xs."

"Both? At yoX and at myself? 3robably trXe. BXt getting less. 0aybe that's
Zhy I coXld say those things today."

"Feels good that yoX trXst me more."

"I had really Zanted to talk aboXt other things today"

"SXch as?" Ernest leaped at the idea—anything to change direction.

As /inda  paXsed to catch her breath, he reflected on her Xncanny intXition,
her chilling bXrst of Zords! Ama]ing  that she had grasped so mXch of him!
HoZ had she knoZn? 2nly one possibility: XnconscioXs empathy. -Xst as
Dr. Werner had said. So Werner had been right all the time. Why didn't I

195
alloZ myself to learn from him? What a jerk, a tZerp, I've been. HoZ did
Werner pXt it? That I'm an iconoclastic .at]enjammer .id?  Well, maybe it's
time to let go of some of my jXvenile TXestioning and debXnking of elders
—not everything they say is bXllshit. 1ever again Zill I doXbt the poZer of
XnconscioXs empathy. 3erhaps it Zas this type of e[perience that had
prompted FreXd to take serioXsly the idea of telepathic commXnication.

"Where are yoXr thoXghts going, /inda," he finally said.

"So mXch to sav. 1ot sXre Zhere to start. Here's a dream I had

192

DoXble E[posXre

last night." She held Xp a spirai tablet. "See, I Zrote it doZn— that's a first."

"YoX are taking oXr Zork more serioXsly."

"Gotta get my one-fifty's Zorth. 2ops!  didn't mean that— sorry—please
press delete key."

"Delete key pressed. YoX caXght yoXrself—that's great. 3erhaps yoX Zere
flXstered by my paying yoX a compliment."

/inda  nodded, bXt hXrried on and read her dream from her notepad:

"I go to have my nose reconstrXcted. They remove the bandages. 0y nose
is okay, bXt the skin had pXckered or pXlled Xp and my moXth is locked
open and is a hXge gaping hole taking half my face. 0y tonsils are visible—
hXge, sZollen, inflamed. Crimson. Then a doctor Zith a nimbXs comes by. I
am sXddenly able to close my moXth. He asks me TXestions, bXt I Zon't
ansZer. I didn't Zant to open my moXth and shoZ him the big gaping hole."

"1imbXs?" Ernest asked Zhen she stopped.

"YoX knoZ, Xh—radiance, holy light, halo."

196
"2h, right.  Yes, nimbXs. So, /inda, Zhat are yoXr thoXghts aboXt the
dream?"

"I think I  knoZ Zhat yoX'll say aboXt it."

"Stay Zith yoXr e[perience. Try to free-associate. What comes to yoX
immediately, as yoX think aboXt the dream?"

"The big hole in my face."

"What comes to mind as yoX think of it?"

"CavernoXs, abyssal, abysmal, inky black. 0ore?"

".eep  going."

"Gigantic, vast, stXpendoXs, monstroXs, Tartarean."

"Tartarean?"

"YoX knoZ, Hell—or the abyss beloZ Hades Zhere the Titans Zere
confined."

"2h, right.  Interesting Zord. Hmm—bXt back to the dream.

YoX're saying there's something yoX don't Zant doctors to see, and I gXess
I'm the doctor?"

"Hard to TXarrel Zith that. Don't Zant yoX to see the big gaping hole, that
emptiness."

"And if  yoX open yoXr moXth, I'll see it. So yoX gXard yoXrself, gXard yoXr
Zords. YoX still see the dream, /inda? Still vivid?"

She nodded.

".eep  looking at it—Zhat  part of it draZs yoXr attention noZ?"

"The tonsils—lot of energy there."

197
"/ook  at them. What do yoX see? What comes to mind?"

"They're hot, scalding."

".eep  going."

"BXrsting, tXrgid, livid, distended, tXmescent, tXrgescent—"

"TXmescent, tXrgescent? And that other one—Tartarean. These Zords,
/inda?"

"I've been broZsing in a thesaXrXs this Zeek."

"Hmm, I'd like to hear more aboXt that, bXt right noZ let's stay Zith the
dream. These tonsils, they're visible if yoX open yoXr moXth. -Xst like the
emptiness. And they're aboXt to bXrst. What'll come oXt?"

"3Xs, Xgliness, something odioXs, hideoXs, loathsome, disgXsting,
e[ecrable, abhorrent, rancid—"

"0ore  thesaXrXs broZsing?"

/inda  nodded.

"So the dream sXggests that yoX're seeing a doctor—me—and oXr Zork is
Xncovering some things yoX don't Zant seen, or yoX don't Zant me to see it
—a vast emptiness, and tonsils ready to bXrst and speZ something vile.
SomehoZ the scalding red tonsils make me think of jXst a feZ minXtes ago
Zhen all those Zords of anger bXrst oXt of yoX."

She nodded again.

"I'm moved by yoXr bringing in this dream," Ernest said. "It's a sign of trXst
in me and Zhat Ze're doing together. It's good Zork—

194

DoXble E[posXre

198
real good Zork." He paXsed. "1oZ can Ze talk thesaXrXs?"

/inda  described the fiery end of her poetry career as a child and her
groZing Zish  to Zrite a poem. "This morning Zhen I Zrote doZn  my
dream, I kneZ yoX'd ask aboXt the hole and the tonsils, so I searched for
interesting Zords."

"SoXnds like yoX Zanted something from me." "Interest, I gXess. I didn't
Zant to be boring any more." "YoXr Zord, not mine. I never said that."
"Still, I'm  convinced yoX feel that Zay aboXt me." "I Zant to come back to
that, bXt first let's look at something else in the dream—the halo aroXnd the
doctor."

"The nimbXs—yes, it Zas cXrioXs. I gXess I've got yoX in the good gXy
category noZ."

"So, yoX think better of me and maybe Zant to be closer to me, bXt the
dilemma is that if Ze get close, I might discover shamefXl things aboXt yoX:
maybe a chasm inside, maybe something else—e[plosive rage, self-
loathing." He looked at his Zatch. "I'm sorry Ze have to stop. The time has
sped by- Again, good hard Zork today. It's been good being Zith yoX."

The hard Zork continXed. Solid therapy hoXrs folloZing one Xpon the other.
Week after Zeek, Ernest and /inda reached neZ levels of trXst. She had
never before risked so mXch of herself; he felt privileged to be a Zitness to
her transformation. It Zas for sXch e[periences that Ernest had become a
psychotherapist. FoXrteen Zeeks after he'd last presented /inda to the
coXnter-transference seminar, he sat at his desk, microphone in hand, and
prepared another presentation.

This is Dr. /ash dictating notes for coXntertransference seminar. In the past
foXrteen Zeeks, both my patient and the therapy process have Xndergone
astoXnding change. It's as if I can divide therapy into tZo stages: before and
after my ill-advised T-shirt comment.

2nly  a feZ minXtes ago, /inda left my office, and I Zas aZare of feeling
sXrprised that the hoXr passed so TXickly. And sorry to see her go. Ama]ing.
She Xsed to bore me. 1oZ she's a

199
vivacioXs and engaging person. Haven't heard a Zhine in Zeeks. We banter
a lot—she's so sharp that it's hard for me to keep Xp Zith her. She's open,
introspective, prodXces interesting dreams, even dabbles in interesting
Zords. 1o more monologXes: she is very  conscioXs of me in the room,
and oXr process has become harmonioXsly interactive. I look forZard to
seeing her as mXch as any other patient—perhaps more.

The si[ty-foXr-dollar TXestion is: HoZ did the T-shirt comment laXnch this
transformation? HoZ to reconstrXct and interpret the events of the last
foXrteen Zeeks?

Dr. Werner Zas certain that the T-shirt comment Zas an egregioXs error,
that it ZoXld resXlt in a rXptXre of the therapeXtic alliance. He Zas dead
Zrong aboXt that. 0y thoXghtless, insensitive crack tXrned oXt to be the
pivotal incident of therapy!

BXt he Zas right—oh, so right—aboXt the patient's ability to tXne in to the
therapist's coXntertransference. She intXited virtXally every single
coXntertransferential feeling I described at the last presentation. And Zith
Xncanny accXracy. It's enoXgh to make a .leinian oXt of me. She missed
nothing. She nailed me on everything. There is not one comment I shared
Zith the groXp the last time I presented her that I haven't had to
acknoZledge e[plicitly  to her. 3erhaps there is some validity to
parapsychology after all. So Zhat if the research has failed to replicate
positive findings? A remarkable incident like this simply demonstrates the
irrelevance of empirical research.

Why is she better? What else coXld it be bXt the Zake-Xp call of the T-shirt
comment? This case has demonstrated to me that there is a place for crXel
honesty, for Zhat Synanon Xsed to call 'hard love.' BXt the therapist has to
back it Xp, has to stay present, stay honest Zith the patient. It reTXires a
relationship that has to be Zell established, that Zill enable therapist and
patient to Zeather the ensXing storm. And in these litigioXs days it reTXires
coXrage. The last time I presented /inda, someone— I think, Barbara—
labeled the T-shirt comment "shock therapy." I agree: that's e[actly Zhat it
Zas. It changed /inda radically, and in the post-shock period I greZ to like
her better. I admired the Zay she hXng in there and kept insisting on straight
feedback. She has a lot of gXts. She mXst have sensed my groZing admira-

200
196

DoXble E[posXre

tion for her. 3eople love themselves if they see a loving image of
themselves reflected in the eyes of someone they really care aboXt.

As Ernest dictated his seminar notes, /inda drove home, also contemplating
the last several therapy sessions. "Good solid Zork," Dr. /ash had called it,
and so it Zas. She Zas proXd of herself. 2ver the last feZ Zeeks, she had
opened herself Xp as never before. She had taken great risks, she had aired
and discXssed even  aspect of her relationship Zith Dr. /ash. Save one, of
coXrse: she had never revealed having listened to his dictation.

Why not? At first, it Zas simply  to lX[Xriate in the pleasXre of tormenting
him Zith his oZn  Zords. To be honest she had enjoyed clXbbing him Zith
her secret knoZledge. There Zere times—especially Zhen he seemed so
fXll of himself, so smXg and certain of his sXperior knoZledge—Zhen she
amXsed herself by imagining his face Zhen she finally told him the trXth.

BXt things had changed. In the last several Zeeks, as she greZ closer to
him, most of the fXn Zent oXt of it. The secret became a bXrden, an
irritating bXrr she Zanted to remove, and she rehearsed confessing it. 0ore
than once, she had entered his office and taken a deep breath, intending to
tell all. BXt she never had—partly oXt of embarrassment for having
concealed it for so long, partly oXt of genXine caring. Dr. /ash had played it
straight: he had denied none of the things she confronted him Zith—almost
nothing. He had been devoted to her Zelfare. Why embarrass the poor man
noZ? Why caXse him pain? That Zas the caring part. BXt there Zas still
another reason. She liked being a magXs, liked the e[citement of secret
knoZledge.

Her penchant for secrets e[pressed itself in an entirely Xnpredictable
fashion. ThesaXrXs in hand, she devoted her evenings to Zriting poetry that
teemed Zith themes of trickery, secrecy', roll-top desks, hidden
compartments. The Internet offered the perfect oXtlet, and she shipped oXt
many poems to the singlepoet.com chat room.

at sealed edges of honeycombed compartments sZollen Zith nectared
mystei'ies When I am big I shall have my oZn chambers, fill them Zith
groZn-Xp secrecy.

The secret she had never revealed to her father loomed larger. As never
before, she felt his presence. His slim bent frame, his medical instrXments,
his desk Zith its secrets held a particXlar fascination for her, Zhich she tried
to e[press in verse.

/inda  hadn't shared these poems Zith Dr. /ash. She had plenty to talk aboXt
in her therapy sessions, and the poetry seemed irrelevant. Besides, her
poems might have invited TXestions aboXt the theme of secrecy, and they
might have led direcdy to the secret of the dictation tape. Sometimes she

202
Zorried that her Zithholding ZoXld  create a Zedge betZeen them. BXt she
assXred herself that she coXld overcome that.

1or did she need Dr. /ash's approval of her poetry. She foXnd plenty of
affirmation elseZhere. The singlepoet.com Internet chat room Zas croZded

/ife  had become e[citing. 1o more overtime at her Silicon 9alley office.
1ightly,  /inda  rXshed home to open her e-mail bo[ Zhich bXlged Zith
praise for her poetry and her refreshing directness. 3erhaps she had been too
hasty to dismiss e-mail relationships as impersonal. 3erhaps the opposite
Zas trXe. 3erhaps electronic friendships—becaXse they did not depend on
skin-deep physical attribXtes—Zere more genXine and comple[.

The electronic sXitors Zho praised her poetry never failed to inclXde their
personal profiles and phone nXmbers. Her self-esteem sXrged. She read and
reread her fan mail. She collected: praise, profiles, phone nXmbers,
information. Dimly, she remembered Dr. /ash's admonition aboXt making
ZithdraZals from  data banks, bXt she liked collecting. She developed a
meticXloXs sXitor-rating scale, Zhich Zeighed earning potential, stock
options, corporate inflXence, TXality of verse, as Zell as personal
characteristics sXch as openness, generosity, and e[pressivity. Several of the
singlepoet chat room sXitors asked for a face-to-face meeting—for an
afternoon e[presso at a Silicon 9alley cafe, for a Zalk, lXnch, dinner. 1ot

Waiting patiendy for a response, Ernest ga]ed at his patient's gray
parameciXm tie and his si[-bXtton gray vest, and tried to remember Zhen he
had last seen a patient Zho Zore a formal three-piece bXsiness sXit or a
paisley tie.

"3lease don't take it Zrong, Doctor," Halston said. "It's not yoX, it's that
there are too many Xne[pected things going on. It's hard taking time off to
come here in the middle of the day—harder than I e[pected ... caXses more
stress ... a parado[, becaXse, after all, the point of seeing yoX Zas to redXce
stress... . And the money for

201

therapy I cannot deny it's a factor . . . feeling a financial pinch noZ. There's
child sXpport. . . three thoXsand a month alimony .. . oldest son commences
3rinceton in the fall .. . thirty thoXsand a year . . . yoX knoZ hoZ it is. I
considered jXst oXtright canceling today, bXt I thoXght it Zas the right thing,
that I oZed it to yoX, to come to a final session."

2ne of his mother's Yiddish e[pressions sXddenly crept oXt of a deep
cortical crevice and Ernest Zhispered it to himself: "Geh GesXnter Heif "Go
in good health,' similar to the blessing said after a snee]e. BXt Geh GesXnter
Heit, as his mother mockingly Xsed it, Zas more insXlt than blessing and
meant, "Go aZay and stay aZay' or 'God Zilling, it Zill  be a long time
before I ever see yoX again."

Yes, it Zas trXe, Ernest acknoZledged to himself, I ZoXldn't mind if
Halston Zent aZay and stayed aZay. I cannot get interested in this man.
Ernest took a good look at his patient—a partial profile, becaXse Halston
never met his ga]e. /ong moXrnfXl face, slate-black skin—he Zas from
Trinidad, the great-great-grandchild of fXgitive slaves. If Halston had ever
had any sort of sparkle, it had long been e[tingXished. He Zas lXsterless, a
compilation of shades of gray: graying hair, perfectly manicXred gray-
streaked goatee, flint eyes, gray sXit, dark socks. And gray bXt-toned-doZn
mind. 1o, no trace of color or animation enlivened Halston's mind or body.

Geh GesXnter Heit, go aZay and stay aZay. Isn't that Zhat Ernest Zas
hoping for? "A final session," Halston had said. Hmm, thoXght Ernest, Has

204
a nice ring to it. I coXld live Zith that. He Zas sZamped noZ, heavily
overschedXled. 0egan, a former patient Zhom he hadn't seen in years, Zas
back. She had attempted sXicide tZo Zeeks ago and Zas making
e[traordinary demands on his time. To keep her safe and oXt of the hospital,
he needed to see her at least three hoXrs a Zeek.

Hey, Zake Xp! He prodded himself. YoX're a therapist. This man came to
yoX for help, and yoX made a commitment to him. YoX don't like him
mXch? He doesn't entertain yoX? He's boring, distant? Has a broomstick Xp
his ass? Great, that's good data. 8se it! If

202

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

yoX feel that Zay toZard him, then so do most people. 5emember his
reason for coming for therapy in the first place— a deep sense of
estrangement.

It Zas obvioXs that Halston Zas stressed becaXse of cXltXral dislocation.
From the age of nine he had lived in Great Britain, and had only recently
arrived in the 8nited States and California as the managing officer of a
British bank. BXt Ernest also believed that cXltXral dislocation Zas only part
of the story— there Zas something profoXndly remote aboXt this man.

2kay, okay, Ernest took his oZn coXnsel: I Zon't say, I Zon't even think,
"Geh GesXnte Heit. " He Zent back to Zork, choosing his Zords carefXlly
so as to engage Halston. "Well, I can certainly Xnderstand that yoX Zant to
redXce stress in yoXr life not to increase it by more time and money
pressXres. 0akes sense. BXt, yoX knoZ, one thing aboXt yoXr decision
pX]]les me."

"Yes, and that is—?"

"Well, I Zas pretty e[plicit  aboXt the time reTXired and the fees before Ze
started meeting. There have been no real sXrprises there. 5ight?"

He nodded. "I gXess. Yes, Doctor, yoX're correct aboXt that."

205
"So, only seems logical to think there's more to it than money and time
pressXres. Something aboXt yoX and me? Is it possible yoX'd feel more
comfortable seeing a black therapist?"

"1o, Doctor, off  the mark. Wrong tree, as yoX Americans say. The racial
difference is not an issXe. 5emember I spent several years at Eton and si[
more at the /ondon School of Economics. 9ery feZ blacks there. I'd feel no
different, I'm sXre, seeing a black therapist."

Ernest decided to give it one final shot, so that he need never accXse himself
of having failed to fXlfill  his professional obligations.

"Well, Halston, let me pXt it another Zay. I Xnderstand the reasons yoX
gave. They make sense. Can't be faXlted. /et's assXme those are sXfficient
reasons to stop. I can honor that decision. BXt before Ze call it a day, I
Zonder if yoX'd consider one other TXestion."

Halston looked Xp Zarily and, Zith a slight nod of his chin, ges-

tXred for Ernest to continXe.

"0v  TXestion is, CoXld there be any additional reasons? I've knoZn many
patients—every therapist has—Zho shied aZay from therapy for reasons
that Zeren't TXite so rational. If that is trXe for yoX, ZoXld yoX be Zilling to
give voice to any of those reasons?"

He paXsed. Halston closed his eyes. Ernest coXld almost hear the gray
cylinders of cognition creaking into motion. WoXld Halston take a chance?
Even money bet, Ernest thoXght. He Zatched Halston open his moXth, jXst a
crack, as thoXgh to speak, bXt no Zords issXed forth.

"I'm not talking aboXt anything big, Halston. BXt even a smidgen, a hint, of
other reasons?"

"3erhaps," Halston ventXred, "I belong neither in therapy nor in California."

3atient and therapist sat looking at one another. Ernest, at Halston's
perfectly bXffedfinger nails and si[-bXtton gray vest; and Halston, it

206
seemed, at his therapist's Xntidy mXstache and Zhite tXrtle-neck sZeater.

Ernest decided to ha]ard a gXess.

"California too loose? 3refer /ondon formality?"

Bingo! Halston's nod Zas almost animated.

"HoZ aboXt in this room?"

"Yes, here too."

"For e[ample?"

"1o offense, Doctor, bXt I'm accXstomed to more professionalism Zhen I
see a physician."

"3rofessionalism?" Ernest felt energi]ed. Finally, something Zas
happening.

"I prefer to consXlt a physician Zho offers a discrete diagnosis and
prescribes a treatment."

"And yoXr e[perience here?"

"I mean no offense, Dr. /ash."

"1one Zill  be taken, Halston. YoXr only task, here, is to speak yoXr mind
freely."

204

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

"Things are jXst—hoZ to pXt it?—too informal here, too—too familiar. We
seem to be fXmbling aboXt, as thoXgh Ze Zere both going somehoZ to
stXmble Xpon the ansZer together."

"YoX see this informality as a denial of oXr professional relationship?"

207
"3recisely. 0akes me Xneasy."

Ernest played it loose. 1othing to lose. Halston Zas most likely gone
anyZay. 0ight  as Zell, Ernest thoXght, give him something he can Xse in
his ne[t therapy.

"I Xnderstand yoXr preference for more formal roles," he said, "and I
appreciate yoXr Zillingness to e[press yoXr feelings aboXt Zorking Zith
me. /et me try to do the same and share Zith yoX my e[perience in Zorking
Zith yoX."

Ernest had Halston's fXll attention. FeZ patients are indifferent to the
prospect of obtaining feedback from their therapist.

"2ne of my major feelings is a certain frXstration—I think it has to do Zith
yoXr being a trifle stingy."

"Stingy?"

"Stingy—Zord-stingy. YoX don't give me mXch. Whenever I ask yoX a
TXestion, yoX send me back a terse telegram. That is, yoX give me as feZ
Zords, as feZ descriptive details, as feZ personal revelations, as possible.
And it is for this very reason that I have tried to establish a more intimate
relationship betZeen Xs. 0y approach to therapy depends on my patients'
sharing their deepest feelings. In my e[perience, formal roles sloZ doZn
that process, and that's my reason—my sole reason—for shXcking them.
And that's also Zhy I often ask yoX to look at yoXr feelings toZard me."

"Everything yoX say is reasonable—I'm sXre yoX knoZ Zhat yoX're doing.
BXt I can't help it— the California toXchy-feely cXltXre sets my teeth on
edge. That's the Zay I am."

"2ne TXestion aboXt that. Are yoX satisfied Zith the Zay yoX are?"

"Satisfied?" Halston looked baffled.

"Well, Zhen yoX say that's the Zay yoX are, I believe yoX're

208
saying, too, that that's the Zay yoX choose to be. So, I'm asking, are yoX
satisfied Zith that choice? With keeping sXch distance, remaining so
impersonal?"

"I'm not sXre it's a choice, Doctor. That," he repeated, "is the Zay I am."

Ernest considered tZo alternatives. He coXld either attempt to persXade
Halston of his oZn responsibility for his remoteness, laXnch one final major
investigation of a specific crXcial episode of Halston's Zithholding. He
chose the latter.

"Well, let me go back once again to the very beginning, to the night yoX
entered the emergency room. /et me tell yoX my side of it. At aboXt foXr in
the morning, I received a call from the emergency room physician
describing a patient in a state of great panic toXched off by a nightmare. I
told the physician to start yoX on medication for the panic, and arranged to
meet Zith yoX tZo hoXrs later, at si[. When Ze met, yoX coXldn't recall
either the nightmare or any of the events of the previoXs evening. In other
Zords, I had no content, nothing to go on."

"That's the Zay it Zas, everything aboXt that evening remains a blackoXt."

"And so I've tried to Zork aroXnd it, and I agree Zith yoX— Ze've made
little headZay. BXt in oXr three hoXrs together, I've been strXck by yoXr
general remoteness from others, from me, possibly from yoXrself. I believe
this remoteness, and yoXr discomfort aboXt my challenging it, is the major
factor motivating yoXr Zish to terminate.

"/et  me share a second observation: I'm strXck by yoXr lack of cXriosity
aboXt yoXrself. I feel that I have to sXpply the cXriosity for both of Xs—that
I alone mXst carry the entire bXrden of oXr Zork."

"I'm not deliberately concealing anything from yoX, Doctor. Why ZoXld I
do that intentionally. That is jXst the Zay I am," he repeated in his Zooden
Zay.

"/et's  try one last time, Halston. HXmor me. I Zant yoX to revieZ again the
events of the day preceding the evening of the

209
206

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

nightmare. /et's go over it Zith  a fine-tooth comb."

"As I told yoX, a normal day at the bank, and that night a horrible
nightmare, Zhich I've forgotten—the drive to the emergency room—"

"1o, no, Ze've done that. /et's try  another approach. Get yoXr date book
oXt. /et's see," Ernest checked his calendar, "oXr first meeting Zas 0ay 9.
Go over yoXr appointments the day before. Start Zith the morning of 0ay
8."

Halston took oXt his Zeek-at-a-glance date book, tXrned to 0ay 8, and
sTXinted. "0ill  9alley," he said, "noZ Zhy  on earth Zas I in 0ill  9alley?
2h, right—  my sister. I remember noZ. I Zasn't in the bank that morning,
after all. I Zas investigating oXt 0ill  9alley."

"What do yoX mean, 'investigating'?"

"0y  sister lives in Saint /oXis and is planning to move to the Bay Area.
She Zas considering a hoXse in 0ill 9alley, and I offered to reconnoiter the
toZn for her—yoX knoZ, morning traffic  patterns, parking, shopping, the
best residential areas."

"Good. E[cellent start. 1oZ  take me throXgh the rest of the day."

"Everything is strangely ha]y—it's almost eerie. I can't recall anything."

"YoX live in San Francisco—do yoX remember driving to 0ill 9alley across
the Golden Gate Bridge? What time?"

"Early, I think Before the traffic. 0aybe  seven."

"Then Zhat? Had yoX eaten breakfast at home? 2r in 0ill 9alley? Try to
pictXre it. /et yoXr mind Zander freely back to that morning. Close yoXr
eyes, if it helps."

210
Halston closed his eyes. After three or foXr minXtes of silence, Ernest
Zondered Zhether he had fallen asleep, and in a soft voice prodded:
"Halston, Halston? Don't move, stay Zhere yoX are, bXt try to think aloXd.
What are yoX seeing in yoXr mind?"

"Doctor"—Halston sloZly  opened his eyes—"did I ever tell yoX aboXt
Artemis?"

"Artemis? The Greek goddess? 1o, not a Zord."

"Doctor," said Halston, blinking his eyes and shaking his head as if to clear
it, "I'm a little  shaken. I've jXst noZ had the oddest e[perience. As thoXgh a
rent sXddenly appeared in my mind, letting all the Xncanny events of that
day poXr throXgh. I don't Zant voX to think I've been deliberately
Zithholding this from  yoX."

"5est assXred, Halston. I'm Zith yoX. YoX started to talk aboXt Artemis."

"Well, I'm jXst sorting things oXt—I'd better start from the beginning of that
accXrsed day— the day before I ZoXnd Xp in the emergency room ..."

Ernest loved stories and sat back, fXll of anticipation. He had the strongest
feeling that this man, Zith Zhom he had spent three pX]]ling hoXrs Zas
noZ going to reveal the secret to a mystery.

"Well, Doctor, yoX knoZ I've been single for almost three years and a little
caXtioXs—more than a little—aboXt another— er—liaison. I told yoX I got
really hXrt, emotionally and financially, by my e[-Zife?"

Ernest nodded. A glance at the clock. Dammit, only fifteen minXtes left. He
ZoXld have to move Halston along if he Zas to hear this story. "And this
Artemis?"

"Well, yes, back to the point, thank yoX. It's fXnny, bXt it Zas yoXr TXestion
aboXt breakfast that morning that triggered something. It's coming clearly
noZ—stopping for breakfast at a cafe in the center of 0ill 9alley, sitting
doZn at a large empty table for foXr. Then the cafe got croZded, and a

211
Zoman asked if she coXld share my table. I looked Xp at her, and I confess I
liked Zhat I saZ."

"HoZ so?"

"E[traordinary-looking  Zoman. BeaXtifXl. 3erfect featXres, fetching smile.
0y  age, I gXess, aroXnd forty, bXt a lithe body, like a teenager. A body, as
American films pXt it, to die for."

Ernest ga]ed at Halston, a different, animated Halston, and Ernest felt
himself Zarming to him.

"Tell me."

"A 'ten.' /ike  Bo Derek. Small Zaist and a most impressive

208

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

bosom. 0any of my Brit  friends prefer androgynoXs Zomen, bXt I hereby
plead gXilty to large-breast fetishism—and, no, Doctor, I don't Zant to
change that."

Ernest smiled reassXringly. Changing Halston's—or his oZn—adoration of
breasts Zas not on his agenda.

"And?"

"Well, I started to talk to her. Her name Zas strange— Artemis—and she
looked ... Zhat shall I say? Well . . . different, 1eZ Age type. 1ot a
cXstomer Zho ZoXld appear at my bank. Imagine, she spread avocado on
her morning bagel and then took oXt of her string pXrse plastic packets of
condiments and sprinkled it Zith sea salt and pXmpkin seeds. And her
costXme Zas straight from .ing's 5oad—floZered  peasant bloXse, long
floZery pXrple skirt, cord belt, lots of gold chains and beads. A floZer child
groZn Xp, she seemed.

212
"BXt," he continXed, his story floZing oXt all the more poZerfXlly for
having been dammed, "in actXality, she Zas doZn to earth, Zell edXcated,
and most lXcid. We strXck Xp an immediate friendship and conversed for
hoXrs, Xntil the Zaitress came to set the table for lXnch. I Zas fascinated by
her and invited her to lXnch Zith me. This, despite the fact that I had a
bXsiness lXncheon schedXled. And I don't have to tell yoX, Doctor, that this
Zas very Xnlike me. In fact, most of this is Xnlike me. Eerie."

"What do yoX mean, Halston?"

"I feel strange saying this becaXse I vieZ this office as a bastion of
rationality, bXt there Zas something very strange aboXt Artemis—alien is
not too strong a term—it's as thoXgh I Zere Xnder a spell. /et me go on.
When she told me she coXldn't have lXnch Zith me becaXse she had a prior
commitment, I asked, 'What aboXt dinner, tonight?'— again ZithoXt even
checking my date book. 'SXre,' she said, and asked me to dine at her home.
She lived alone, she said and had planned to cook a mXshroom ragoXt Zith
some chanterelles she had picked the day before from the 0oXnt Tamal-
pais forest."

"And yoX did'"

"Did I? 0ost  assXredly I did. And it Zas one of the premier evenings of my
life—at least, Xp to a momentoXs point." He paXsed, shaking his head again
as Zhen his memory had first retXrned to him; then Zent on. "It Zas
e[traordinary being Zith  her. Everything floZed natXrally. /egendary
dinner—Zhat a marveloXs cook. And I'd broXght some first-class California
Zine, a Stag's /eap ]infandel. And then after dessert, a first rate British
trifle—the first I've  seen in this coXntry—she broXght oXt some marijXana. I
hesitated bXt decided, 'When in California, live as the natives, and I took the
first pXff of my life."  A befXddled look on his face, Halston paXsed.

"And?" Ernest prodded.

"And then, after Ze cleared the dishes, I began to feel a Zarm pleasant
gloZ." Another paXse, another headshake.

"And?"

213
"That Zas Zhen the most e[traordinary thing happened— she asked me if I
Zanted to go to bed Zith her. -Xst like that, all matter of fact, She Zas so
natXral, so gracefXl, so—so—I don't knoZ— adXlt. 1one of that typical
American 'Will she or Zon't she?' melodrama I detest."

Good /ord!  Ernest thoXght, What a Zoman, Zhat an evening! /Xcky man!
Then glancing again at the clock, he hXrried Halston along. "YoX said it Zas
one of the great evenings of yoXr life—bXt only Xp to some momentoXs
point?"

"Yes, the se[ Zas sheer ecstasy. E[traordinary. 8nlike any I've ever even
imagined."

"HoZ so e[traordinary?"

"It's all still  a bit of a ha]e, bXt I remember her licking me like a kitten,
every sTXare centimeter, head to toe, Xntil every pore on my body Zas
gaping open, begging for more, tingling Zith delight, receptive to her toXch,
her tongXe, drinking in her scent and Zarmth." He stopped. "I'm a bit
embarrassed e[pressing all this, Doctor."

"Halston, yoX're doing e[actly Zhat yoX shoXld be doing here. Try to
continXe."

210

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

"Well, the pleasXre jXst kept spiraling Xp. It Zas XnZorldly, I tell yoX. The
head of my—my—Zhat do yoX say?—organ—lit Xp, hotter and hotter, Xntil
I had an absolXtely incandescent orgasm. And then I think I passed oXt."

Ernest Zas ama]ed. Was this the boring, constricted man Zith Zhom he had
spent those tedioXs hoXrs?

"Then Zhat happened, Halston?"

"Ah, that Zas the tXrning point, that's Zhen everything changed. The ne[t
thing I kneZ I Zas someZhere else. 1oZ I reali]e  it mXst have been a

214
dream, bXt at the time it Zas so real I coXld toXch and feel and smell
everything in it. It's faded aZay, bXt I can recall being chased throXgh a
forest by a menacing giant cat—a hoXse cat the si]e of a lyn[, bXt all black,
Zith a Zhite  mask aroXnd its red gleaming eyes, a thick poZerfXl tail, hXge
fangs, and ra]or claZs. It Zas chasing the bloody hell oXt of me! Far aZay I
saZ a naked Zoman standing in a pond. /ooked like Artemis, so I jXmped
in and Zaded toZard her for help. Closer Xp I saZ it Zasn't Artemis at all
bXt a robot Zith enormoXs breasts oXt of Zhich streamed jets of green
Zater. Then, even closer, I saZ it Zasn't Zater bXt some kind of gloZing
radioactive liTXid. And then I reali]ed, Zith horror, that I Zas standing
thigh-deep in the corrosive stXff Zhich Zas starting to eat aZay at my feet
and legs. I Zaded frantically toZard land again bXt there—still hissing and
Zaiting for me, Zas that damned cat, noZ bigger—big as a lion. That's
Zhen I bolted oXt of bed and ran for my life. I pXt on my clothes rXnning
doZn the stairs and Zas still shoeless Zhen I started the car. I coXldn't
breathe, and called my physician on the car phone. He told me to go to the
emergency room—and that's Zhen I Zas referred to yoX."

"And Artemis?"

"Artemis? 1ada. I ZoXldn't go near her again. She's poison. Even noZ, jXst
talking aboXt her is starting to bring some of that panic back. I think that's
Zhy I bXried all of this so deep in my mind." Halston TXickly checked his
pXlse. "See, I'm racing right noZ—tZenty-eight in fifteen seconds—
appro[imately one hXn-

dred tZelve."

"BXt hoZ did she feel aboXt yoXr sXddenly rXnning oXt?"

"I don't knoZ—or  care. She slept right throXgh everything."

"So she Zent to sleep ne[t to yoX and Zoke Xp Zith yoX gone and has no
idea Zhy."

"And it's going to remain that Zay! I tell yoX, Doctor—that dream Zas from
another Zorld, another reality—from Hell."

215
"Halston, Ze've got to stop. We're rXnning Zay late, bXt it's clear there's
mXch to Zork on. 0ost obvioXsly, yoXr feelings toZard Zomen— yoX
make love to a Zoman and then encoXnter this cat Zhich personifies danger
and pXnishment, and then desert her Zith no Zord of e[planation. And then
the breasts that promise nXrtXrance bXt instead sTXirt poison. Tell me, Zhere
are yoX in yoXr Zishes to stop therapy?"

"It is obvioXs even to me, Doctor, that there is mXch to e[plore. Same time
available ne[t Zeek?"

"Yes. And—good Zork today. I'm pleased, Halston, honored, that yoX
trXsted me enoXgh to remember and reveal to me this Zhole remarkable and
frightening incident."

TZo hoXrs later, on his Zalk to -asmine, a Clement Street 9ietnamese
restaXrant Zhere he often lXnched, Ernest had time to think aboXt his
session Zith Halston. 2n the Zhole, he Zas satisfied Zith the Zay he had
handled the threat to terminate. Even thoXgh he Zas overschedXled, he
ZoXld not have liked himself if he had jXst let his patient Zalk oXt. Halston
Zas strXggling to get throXgh to something important, and Ernest kneZ that
his concerned, methodical, bXt not overly aggressive tactics had saved the
day.

It Zas remarkable hoZ, Ernest thoXght, that as he greZ more e[perienced,
feZer and feZer patients ever terminated prematXrely. HoZ threatened he
Zas, as a yoXng therapist, by termination, taking everything personally and
regarding every  patient Zho TXit as a personal defeat, a mark of
ineffectiveness, a pXblic disgrace. And he Zas gratefXl to 0arshal, his
former sXpervisor, for teaching him that sXch a reaction insXres
ineffectiveness.

212

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

Whenever therapists have too mXch ego riding on a patient's decision,
Zhenever they need a patient to stay in therapy, that's Zhen they lose their
effectiveness: they begin to Zheedle, to be sedXctive, to give patients

216
e[actly Zhat they Zish—  anything to get them to retXrn the folloZing
Zeek.

Ernest Zas glad, too, that he had sXpported and complimented Halston
rather than voicing any doXbts aboXt the aXthenticity of the dramatic recall
of the Artemis evening. Ernest Zasn't sXre hoZ to evalXate Zhat he had jXst
heard. He kneZ, of coXrse, of sXdden retXrns of repressed material, bXt he
had had little personal e[perience Zith sXch phenomena in his clinical
Zork. ThoXgh relatively common in traXmatic stress disorder, to say
nothing of HollyZood  portrayals of therapy, it Zas rare in Ernest's TXotidian
psychotherapy.

BXt all of Ernest's self-congratXlatory impXlses passed TXickly, as did all of
his benevolent thoXghts aboXt Halston. What really captXred his attention
Zas Artemis. The more he thoXght aboXt it, the more horrified he Zas by
Halston's behavior toZard her. What kind of monster ZoXld make love,
fantastic love, to a Zoman and then abandon her Zith no e[planation, no
note, no phone call? It Zas beyond belief.

Ernest's heart Zent oXt to Artemis. He kneZ e[acdy hoZ she mXst have felt.
2nce, years ago, he had arranged a Zeekend rende]voXs Zith 0yrna, an old
girlfriend, at a 1eZ  York hotel. They spent a lovely night together, or so
Ernest believed. In the morning he left for a brief appointment and retXrned
Zith a hXge, gratefXl boXTXet of floZers. BXt no 0yrna. She had left
ZithoXt a trace. 3acked her bags and absconded—no note, and no response
to his later phone calls or letters. 1o e[planation ever. He Zas devastated.
3sychotherapy never entirely erased his pain, and even noZ, all these years
later, the memory still stXng. Above all, Ernest hated not knoZing. 3oor
Artemis, she had given so mXch to Halston, taken sXch risks, and, in the
end, been so shabbily treated.

2ver the ne[t feZ  days, Ernest thoXght little aboXt Halston bXt

retXrned again and again to Artemis. In his fantasy, she became a goddess—
beaXtifXl, giving, nXrtXring bXt badly ZoXnded. Artemis Zas a Zoman to
revere, honor, treasXre: the idea of debasing" sXch a Zoman seemed hardly
hXman to him. HoZ tormented she mXst be by not knoZing Zhat happened!
HoZ many times mXst she have relived that night, trying to Xnderstand

217
Zhat she had said, Zhat she had done, to drive Halston aZay: And Ernest
kneZ he Zas in a privileged position to help her. Aside from Halston. I am.
he thoXght. the only one ]:bo kno]: the trXth of that night.

Ernest had often been aZash Zith grandiose fantasies of rescXing distressed
damsels. He kneZ that aboXt himself. HoZ coXld he not knoZ? Again and
again, his analyst. 2live Smith, and his sXpervisor. 0arshall St[ider, had
nibbed his nose in it. 5escXe fantasies played a role both in his personal
relationships, Zhere he overlooked Zarning signals of obvioXs
incompatibility and in his psychotherapy, Zhere his coXntertransference ran
Zild  and" he became overinvested in cXring his female patients.

1atXrally, as Ernest pondered the rescXe of Artemis, the voices of his
analyst and sXpervisor came to mind. Ernest accepted their critiTXe—bXt
only to a point. Deep inside, he believed that his overinvestment made him
a better therapist, a better hXman being-. 2f coXrse, Zomen shoXld be
rescXed. Thats an evolXtionary trXism, a species-sXrvival strategy, bXilt into
oXr genes. HoZ horrified he'd been long ago Zhen, in his comparative
anatomy coXrse, he foXnd that the cat he Zas dissecting had been pregnant
and Zas carrying five tiny, marble-si]e fetXses in her XterXs. /ikeZise
caviar, possible only throXgh the slaXghter and plXndering of pregnant
stXrgeon. -0ost horrifying had been the 1a]i e.vrerrnination policy: hoZ
more than anything it Zas a Zar against Zomen, the seedbearers of the race.

.And so. Ernest neither TXestioned his decision to persXade Halston to
redress his transgression. "Consider Zhat she mXst have felt," he Xrged his
patient again and again—to Zhich Halston ZoXld irritably reply. "Doctor.
I'm the patient, not her." 2r he ZoXld Xrge on Halston the Zisdom of the
eighth and ninth steps of the tZelve -

114

The HXngarian ^at CXrse

step recovery program: make a list of all persons Ze have harmed, and
make direct amends to sXch persons Zhenever possible. BXt all his
argXments, no matter hoZ skillfXlly pXt, failed to bXdge Halston, Zho
seemed Xnimaginably self-absorbed and calloXs. 2nce he chided Ernest on

218
his softheadedness. "Aren't yoX overromantici]ing this one-night stand?
This is her mode of life. I'm not the first man she's accosted and probably
not the last. I assXre yoX, Doctor, this lady can take care of herself."

Ernest Zondered Zhether Halston had dXg in his heels oXt of sheer spite.
3erhaps he had sensed his therapist's overinvolvement Zith Artemis and
Zas retaliating by rejecting, aXtomatically, all of Ernest's advice. BXt, in any
event, Ernest gradXally reali]ed both that Halston ZoXld never make
amends to Artemis, as Zell that he, Ernest, ZoXld have to assXme that
bXrden. CXrioXsly, despite his heavy schedXle, he did not mind accepting
the task It seemed like a moral imperative, and he began to vieZ it not as a
millstone bXt as his ministry. CXrioXsly, too, Ernest, generally self-analytic
to a faXlt, sXbjecting every Zhim, every decision, to a searching and tedioXs
scrXtiny, never once TXestioned his motives. He did reali]e, hoZever, that
he Zas Xndertaking an Xnorthodo[ and illegitimate mission—Zhat other
therapist had ever taken it Xpon himself to make personal amends for his
patient's misdeeds?

Despite his reali]ation that secrecy and delicacy Zere reTXired, Ernest's his
first steps Zere clXmsy and transparent: "Halston, one last time. /et's go
over yoXr meeting Zith Artemis and the type of connection yoX made Zith
her."

"1ot  again? As I've said, I Zas in a cafe Zhen—"

"1o, try  to paint the scene vividly and precisely. Describe the cafe. The
time? Its location?"

"It Zas in 0ill   9alley,  aboXt eight A.0., in one of those TXaint California
innovations—combination bookstore and cafe."

"Its name?" Ernest Xrged Zhen Halston paXsed. "Describe everything aboXt
yoXr meeting."

"Doctor, I don't Xnderstand. Why these TXestions?"

"HXmor me on this, Halston. 3ainting the scene as vividly as

219
possible Zill help yoX to recall all the feelings yoX e[perienced."

To Halston's protests that he had no interest in recalling the feelings, Ernest
reminded him that the development of empathy Zas a first step in
improving his relationships Zith Zomen. Hence, recalling his e[periences
and Zhat Artemis may have e[perienced ZoXld be a valXable e[ercise. A
lame rationale, Ernest kneZ, bXt it seemed plaXsible.

As Halston dXtifXlly recoXnted all the details of that eventfXl day, Ernest
listened hard, bXt learned only a feZ neZ things. The cafe Zas the Book
Depot, and Artemis Zas a lover of literatXre— that, Ernest felt, might be
XsefXl information. She had told Halston that she Zas in the midst of
rereading the great German novelists— 0ann, .leist, Boll—and that very
day had pXrchased a copy of the neZ translation of 0Xsil's The 0an
ZithoXt 4Xalities.

BecaXse of Halston's increasing sXspicioXsness, Ernest eased off—lest, at
any moment, his patient might say, "/ook, yoX Zant her address and phone
nXmber?"

Which is, of coXrse, precisely Zhat Ernest did Zant. WoXld save him a lot
of time. BXt he noZ had enoXgh to begin.

Bright and early one morning a feZ days later, Ernest drove to 0ill 9alley,
parked, and Zalked into the Book Depot. He looked aroXnd the long narroZ
bookstore, once a train depot, and then checked the cheery cafe attached to
it and the do]en oXtdoor tables Zarming in the morning sXn. Finding no
Zoman resembling Halston's description of Artemis, he Zent to the coXnter
and ordered an e[tra-seedy bagel from the Zaitress, Zhose nose and lips
Zere lavishly beringed.

"Bagel Zith Zhat?"  she asked.

Ernest scanned the menX board. 1o avocado. Was Halston fabricating?
Finally he decided to pXt himself at an advantage by ordering cXcXmbers
and sproXts Zith his herb and chive cream cheese.

220
As he settled himself at a table, he saZ her enter. FloZered bXlging bloXse,
long plXm-colored skirt—his favorite hXe— beads, chains and all: it had to
be Artemis. 0ore beaXtifXl than he

216

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

had imagined. Halston hadn't mentioned, perhaps had not even noticed, her
lXstroXs golden hair, Zhich she Zore middle-EXropean style, sZept in a coil
and held firm Zith a tortoise shell clasp at the back of her head. Ernest
melted aZay: all his lovely 9iennese aXnts, the first objects of his pXbescent
erotic drive, had Zorn their hair in that very fashion. He took her in TXickly
as she ordered and paid at the coXnter. What a Zoman—lovely in all Zays,
penetrating tXrTXoise-blXe eyes, heavy lips, finely dimpled chin, aboXt five
foot foXr inches in her flat sandals, a stirring, rippling, perfectly
proportioned body.

1oZ  came the part that alZays flXmmo[ed Ernest: hoZ to begin a
conversation Zith a Zoman? He took oXt 0ann's The Holy Sinner, Zhich
he had boXght the day before, and laid it open on the table, the title clearly
visible. 3erhaps it ZoXld provide the opening gambit in a conversation—if,
that is, she chose a table nearby Ernest glanced nervoXsly aroXnd the half
empty cafe. 3lenty of free tables. He nodded Zhen she passed, and Artemis
nodded in response, as she made her Zay to an empty table. BXt then,
mirabile dictX —a coXple of seconds later, she backed Xp.

"2h, The Holy  Sinner," she, incredibly, reamarked. "What a sXrprise!"

"I—er—I  beg yoXr pardon," Ernest stammered. 1oZ he Zasn't TXite sXre
hoZ to pXll his catch in. He Zas in shock—the shock of a resignedly
XnsXccessfXl fisherman Zho is astoXnded by a tXg on his line. He had Xsed
the book lXre coXntless times throXgh the years, and not even once had a
nibble.

"That book," she e[plained. "Why I read The Holy Sinner years ago, bXt
I've never seen anyone else reading it since.

221
"2h, I  love it, and go back to it every feZ years. I love some of 0ann's
shorter Zorks, too, and am jXst starting to reread all of him. This one is the
first."

"I jXst reread The Transposed Head," Artemis said. What's ne[t on yoXr
list?"

"I'm doing them in the order I treasXre them. 1e[t'll be -oseph and His
Brothers tetralogy. And then, perhaps, Feli[ .rXll. BXt," he

half rose, "Zon't yoX sit doZn?"

"And last?" asked Artemis, setting her bagel and coffee on the table and
sitting doZn across from him.

"The 0agic  0oXntain'''  Ernest responded, not missing a beat, not revealing
his sheer astonishment at netting this catch. "It jXst hasn't aged Zell—
Settembrini's endless conversations strike me noZ as tedioXs. Also, at the
bottom of the list is Donor FaXstXs. The mXsicological concerns are jXst too
technical and, I'm afraid, boring."

"I agree Zith yoX entirely," said Artemis, reaching into her shoXlder bag and
e[tracting a black ripe avocado and several plastic bags of seeds, "thoXgh I
never cease to be fascinated Zith the 1iet]sche-/everkXhn connection."

"2h, I'm  sorry, I haven't introdXced myself—lost in oXr conversation. I'm
Ernest /ash."

"I'm Artemis," she said as she peeled her avocado, spread half of it on her
bagel, and topped it Zith sprinkles of varioXs seeds.

"Artemis, a lovely name. YoX knoZ, it's Zarming Xp oXtside. HoZ aboXt
grabbing a table and joining yoXr tZin oXt there." Ernest had indXstrioXsly
done his homeZork.

"0y  tZin?"  Artemis pondered, as they moved to a table in the sXn. "0y
tZin? 2h,  Apollo!  The golden sXnlight of brother Apollo. YoX are an

222
XnXsXal man—all my life I've lived Zith my name, and yoX're the first
person Zho has ever said that to me."

"BXt yoX knoZ," Ernest continXed, "I mXst confess I may pXt aside 0ann
for a Zhile so as to get to the neZ Wilkins translation of 0Xsil's 0an
WithoXt 4Xalities."

"What a coincidence," Artemis' eyes opened Zide. "I'm reading that book
right noZ." 5eaching into her shoXlder bag again, she pXlled oXt a book.
"It's glorioXs."

From then on Artemis never took her eyes off Ernest. Indeed her ga]e Zas
so fi[ed on his lips that every feZ minXtes Ernest self-conscioXsly brXshed
his mXstache to dislodge any errant crXmbs.

"I love living  in 0arin  bXt sometimes it's not easy to have a

218

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

serioXs conversation here," she said, offering him a slice of avocado. "The
last time I talked aboXt this book, I Zas Zith someone Zho'd never heard of
0Xsil."

"Well, everyone's not Xp to him." What a pity, Ernest thoXght, that a soXl
like Artemis had to pXt Xp for any time at all Zith the tight-assed Halston's
company."

For the ne[t three hoXrs they meandered happily throXgh the Zork of
Heinrich Boll, GXnter Grass, and Heinrich .leist. Ernest looked at his
Zatch. Almost noon! What an e[traordinary Zoman, he thoXght. ThoXgh he
had cleared his morning schedXle, he had five consecXtive sessions starting
at one o'clock. Time Zas rXnning oXt, and he tXrned to the real bXsiness of
the day.

"I'm going to have to leave soon," he said, "very mXch against my Zill, bXt
my patients aZait me. I cannot tell yoX hoZ mXch I've enjoyed oXr talk. It's

223
really broXght me oXt of myself. I needed it at this point in my life."

"HoZ come?"

"It's been a bad time." Ernest sighed, hoping his Zords, Zhich he had
rehearsed several times the night before, ZoXld seem spontaneoXs. "AboXt
tZo Zeeks ago, I visited an old girlfriend of mine. Hadn't seen her for a
coXple of years, and Ze had a lovely tZenty-foXr hoXrs together. 2r, so I
thoXght. In the morning, I aZoke and she Zas gone. 9anished. 1ot a trace
of her. I've been in a bad Zay since. Avery bad Zay!"

"That's dreadfXl." Artemis Zas more concerned than Ernest had ever hoped
for. "She Zas important to yoX? YoX Zere hoping to reconnect Zith her?"

"Well, no." Ernest thoXght of Halston and hoZ she mXst have felt aboXt
him. "That's not TXite it. She Zas—Zell, Zhat shoXld I say?—more of a
playmate, a se[Xal friend. So I'm not in grief aboXt losing her. The real pain
is not knoZing. Was it something I did that caXsed her to rXn? Did I hXrt her
in some manner? Something I said? Was I an inconsiderate lover? Was I in
some fXndamental Zay Xnacceptable? YoX knoZ Zhat I mean. Stirs Xp a lot
of bad stXff."

"I'm Zith  yoX on that one," she said, shaking her head sympathetically.
"Been throXgh that myself—and not too long ago."

"5eally? It's ama]ing hoZ  mXch Ze seem to have in common. ShoXldn't Ze
try to heal one another? ContinXe this conversation some other time—say,
at dinner tonight?

"Yes, bXt not a restaXrant. I'm in a cooking mood. Yesterday I picked some
beaXtifXl chanterelles Zhich I'm going to make into a HXngarian mXshroom
ragoXt. -oin me?"

1ever had therapy hoXrs ticked by so sloZly. Ernest coXld think of nothing
bXt Artemis. He Zas enchanted Zith her. Again and again, he prodded
himself: Concentrate! FocXs! Earn yoXr fee! SZeep this Zoman from yoXr
mind. BXt Artemis refXsed to be sZept. She had set Xp hoXsekeeping in his
frontal corte[ and there she stayed. There Zas something eerie and allXring

224
aboXt Artemis that broXght to mind the immortal, irresistible African TXeen
he remembered from 5ider Haggard's novel, She.

It did not escape Ernest that he Zas thinking more aboXt Artemis's charms
than aboXt alleviating her distress. Ernest, mind yoXr priorities, he rebXked
himself. What are yoX doing? This Zhole project is deeply sXspect even
ZithoXt any se[Xal adventXres. YoX're already treading on thin ice—milking
Halston for data aboXt hoZ to find Artemis, tXrning yoXrself into an
Xninvited traveling therapist paying a hoXse call on an attractive female
stranger. YoX're being grandiose, he caXtioned himself, and Xnethical and
Xnprofessional. CarefXl, carefXl, carefXl!

'YoXr honor," he imagined his sXpervisor's voice booming from the Zitness
stand, "Dr. /ash is a fine and ethical clinician e[cept Zhen he occasionally
lapses into thinking Zith his small head."

1o, no, no! Ernest protested. I'm doing nothing Xnethical. I intend an act of
integrity, an act of charity*. Halston, my patient, Zantonly inflicted a
grievoXs ZoXnd on another person, and it is inconceivable that he Zill ever
be Zilling  to make reparation. I, and only I, can redress the injXry and do it
TXickly and efficiendy.

Artemis's Hansel and Gretel hoXse—small, high-gabled, dripping Zith
gingerbread laceZork and sXrroXnded by a dense roZ

220

ine HXngarian Cat CXrse

of topped jXnipers—ZoXld have better sXited Germany's Black Forest than
0arin  CoXnty- Greeting him at the door Zith a glass of fresh-sTXee]ed
pomegranate jXice, Artemis apologi]ed for not having alcohol in the hoXse
— "DrXg-free ]one here," she said, then added, "e[cept for ganja, the holy
herb."

As soon as he sat doZn on the sofa, a faX[-/oXis ;9i canape covered Zith
petit point and sXpported by dainty gray-Zhite legs, Ernest retXrned to the
sXbject of abandonment. BXt, althoXgh he Xsed all his practiced skills to

225
draZ her oXt, he soon had to recogni]e that he had overestimated Artemis'
distress.

Yes, she acknoZledged, she had been throXgh the same kind of e[perience
as Ernest, and it had not been easy. BXt it Zas less painfXl than she had
sXggested: she Zas, she confessed only being polite. It Zas only to help
Ernest to talk aboXt his difficXlties that she had mentioned she'd recendy
been deserted by a man. ThoXgh he had bailed oXt Zith no e[planation to
her, she had not been mXch troXbled by the event. The relationship hadn't
been meaningfXl, and she Zas certain that it Zas far more his problem than
hers. Ernest looked at her in ama]ement: this Zoman Zas more centered
than he coXld ever hope to be. He rela[ed, going off dXty as a therapist, and
tXrned to enjoying the rest of the evening.

Halston's enthXsiastic accoXnt had prepared Ernest for the events to come.
BXt it soon became clear that Halston had Xnderstated, and probably
Xnderappreciated, everything. The conversation Zith Artemis Zas
delightfXl, the chanterelle ragoXt a small miracle, and the rest of the evening
a mXch larger miracle.

AZare that Halston's e[perience might have been drXg-indXced, Ernest
refXsed the after-dinner marijXana that Artemis offered. BXt even ZithoXt it,
something XnXsXal, almost sXrreal seemed to be Zorking in him. DXring
dinner a Zarm ZonderfXl flXsh began to sZeep over him from head to toe.
3leasant feelings from the past flooded his mind, each entering from
another angle. The smell of his mother's baking .ichel on SXnday
mornings; the Zarmth in the first feZ seconds after Zetting his bed; his first
kiss; his first pistol-shot orgasm, Zhile mastXrbating in the bathtXb and
imagining

Xndressing AXnt Harriet; eating hot fXdge ice cream cakes at the Georgia
AvenXe Hot Shoppe; the Zeightlessness dXring roller-coaster rides at Glen
Echo AmXsement 3ark; moving his TXeen, protected by a sly bishop, and
saying "Shah mott" —checkmate—to his father. His sense of Heimlichkeit
—Zarm and Zet at-homeness— Zas so strong, so enveloping that he
momentarily lost track of Zhere he Zas.

226
"Do yoX Zant to go Xpstairs to the bedroom?" Artemis's soft voice snapped
him oXt of his reverie. Where had he gone? CoXld there have been
something in the mXshrooms, he Zondered? Do I Zant to go to the
bedroom? I ZoXld folloZ this Zoman anyZhere. I desire her like no other
Zoman I have ever knoZn. 0aybe it'is neither the grass nor the
mXshrooms, bXt some XnXsXal pheromone. 0y olfactory bXlb, behind my
back, consorting Zith her mXsk aroma?

2nce in bed Artemis began licking. Every inch of his skin tingling,
gloZing, Xntil his Zhole  body felt red-hot. Each stroke of her tongXe noZ
sent him higher and higher Xntil he e[ploded— not Zith the sharp crack of
a yoXng pistol shot, bXt Zith the roar of a mighty hoZit]er. In a brief
moment of lXcidity, he sXddenly noticed Artemis do]ing by his side. He had
been so transported by his pleasXre that he had all bXt forgotten her, had
failed to attend to her pleasXre. 5eaching oXt to toXch her face, he felt her
cheeks Zet Zith streaming tears. Then he fell into the deepest sleep he had
ever knoZn.

Sometime later the soXnd of scratching aZakened him. At first, in the
pitchblack room he coXld see nothing. BXt he kneZ that something Zas
Zrong, terribly Zrong.  GradXally, as the black receded, a ghostly green
Zeirdly lighted the room. His heart poXnding, Ernest slid oXt of bed, pXlled
on his troXsers, and ran to the ZindoZs to find oXt Zhat Zas scratching: all
he coXld see, staring back at him, Zas the reflection of his oZn face. He
tXrned to roXse Artemis—bXt she had vanished. The scratching and
scraping greZ loXder. Then an Xnearthly yeeeooooZZZZ, like a thoXsand
cats in heat, shook the room. It started to vibrate, softly

222

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

at first, then Zith increasing intensity. The scratching soXnd greZ ever
loXder and coarser: he heard the soXnd of pebbles striking the groXnd, then
larger stones, then a small avalanche. It seemed to come from behind the
bedroom Zall. Approaching it gingerly, he saZ cracks appear in the Zall;
plaster flaked, falling into a heap on the carpet. Soon he coXld see dryZall;

227
Xnder that, moments later, the Zooden laths of the hoXse skeleton lay bare.
Crash! A gigantic paZ bristling Zith  claZs broke throXgh.

Ernest had seen enoXgh. Grabbing his shirt, he headed for the stairs. BXt
there Zere no stairs, no Zalls, no hoXse. Before him lay a black starlit
e[panse. He began to rXn and soon foXnd himself in a forest of toZering
conifers. Hearing a thXndering roar, he looked back to see behind him a
monstroXs cat Zith fire-red eyes—a Hon, bXt black and Zhite and mXch
larger. Bear-si]e. Saber-toothed-tiger si]e. He ran faster, he practically fleZ,
bXt ever loXder, and closer, greZ the thXmp of the beast's padded paZs
poXnding the pine-needle floor of the forest. Seeing a lake, he headed
toZard it. Cats hate Zater, Ernest thoXght, and Zaded in. He heard, far off
in the misty center of the lake, the soXnd of Zater streaming. Then he saZ
her: Artemis, standing stock still in the middle of the lake. 2ne hand raised
high like the StatXe of /iberty, Zhile the other hand cXpped one of her
enormoXs breasts, oXt of Zhich, as she pointed it toZard him, gXshed a
mighty stream of Zater or milk. 1o,  he saZ as he approached closer, it Zas
not milk bXt a green flXorescent liTXid. 1or Zas the figXre Artemis, bXt a
metal robot. And the lake Zas not Zater bXt acid, eating aZay at his feet
and legs. He opened his moXth and Zith all his strength tried to scream:
"0omma!  0omma!  Help me, 0omma!"   BXt no Zords came.

The ne[t thing Ernest kneZ, he Zas in his car, half dressed, pressing hard on
the accelerator and ]ooming doZn 0arin Drive, aZay from  Artemis's Black
Forest hoXse. He tried to focXs on Zhat had happened to him, bXt fear
overZhelmed him. HoZ many times had he preached to patients and
stXdents that a crisis represents not only danger bXt opportXnity? HoZ many
times

had he preached that an[iety is a trail that leads to insight and Zisdom?
That, of all dreams, the nightmare is the most instrXctive? Yet, Xpon
reaching his 5Xssian Hill apartment, Ernest dashed in the door and headed,
not to his Zriting pad to record the dream, bXt to his medicine cabinet and a
professional sample pack of tZo milligram Ativan tablets, a heavy dXty
anti-an[iety drXg. BXt that night the drXg broXght neither relief nor sleep. In
the morning, he canceled his entire day's schedXle and managed to sTXee]e
his more Xrgent patients into slots the folloZing evening.

228
He spent the early morning on the phone talking throXgh his e[perience
Zith good friends; and some tZenty-foXr hoXrs later, the terrible, cramping,
an[ioXs oppression in his chest began to lessen. The process of talking, the
sheer confessional act, Zas helpfXl even thoXgh none of them seemed able
to grasp Zhat had happened. Even 3aXl, his closest and oldest chXm Zho
had been his confidant since residency training, Zas off the mark: he tried
to persXade Ernest that the nightmare Zas a blessing, a caXtionary tale
Zarning Ernest to be more circXmspect aboXt honoring professional
boXndaries.

Ernest defended himself vigoroXsly. "5emember, 3aXl, Artemis is no friend
of my patient. And I did not intentionally Xse my patient to sXpply me Zith
Zomen. And throXghoXt, my intentions Zere high-minded. 0y pXrpose in
seeking her oXt Zas not carnal bXt simply to repair the damage my patient
had done. I did not visit her for a se[Xal assignation—it jXst seemed
impossible to stop that from happening."

"3rosecXting attorneys ZoXldn't see it that Zay, Ernest," 3aXl responded
somberly "They'd make mincemeat oXt of yoX."

His former sXpervisor, 0arshal, offered him a fragment of the caXtionary
lectXre he roXtinely delivered to his local Boy ScoXt troop: "Even if yoX're
doing no Zrong, don't get into any sitXation Zhere a snapshot of yoX ZoXld
sXggest the semblance of doing Zrong."

Ernest Zas sorry he had phoned 0arshal. The snapshot

224

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

homily did not impress him; on the contrary, he thoXght it oXtrageoXs to
advise children to behave circXmspecdy simply to avoid misrepresentation
in the media.

In the end, Ernest paid little heed to his friends' advice. They Zere all
pXsillanimoXs, preoccXpied Zith issXes of appearance and potential

229
malpractice litigation. From the inside perspective, the one that coXnted,
Ernest Zas entirely persXaded that he had acted Zith integrity.

After tZenty-foXr hoXrs recXperation, Ernest took Xp his practice again and,
foXr days later, met Zith Halston Zho annoXnced that he decided, after all,
to terminate therapy. Ernest kneZ he had failed Halston, Zho had
XndoXbtedly sensed Ernest's disapproval of him. Ernest's gXilt aboXt his
poor therapy Zas brief, hoZever becaXse Zhile thinking aboXt his patient,
he had a stXnning revelation: in the last seventy-tZo hoXrs, ever since my
phone conversations Zith 3aXl and 0arshal, I have entirely forgotten the
e[istence of Artemis! That breakfast Zith her, everything afterZard! 1ot
once have I thoXght of her! 0y God, I have acted in precisely the same
repXgnant manner as Halston, deserting her ZithoXt a Zord of e[planation
and never bothering to phone or see her.

For the rest of that day and the ne[t, Ernest encoXntered the same strange
phenomenon: again and again, he tried to think aboXt Artemis, bXt coXld
not keep his focXs; Zithin a feZ moments, his mind ZoXld Zander to
inconseTXential topics. /ate the ne[t evening, he decided to phone her, and
it Zas only Zith  the greatest effort—Ernest visXali]ed himself cXrling fifty
poXnds—that he sXcceeded in dialing her nXmber.

"Ernest! Is that really yoX?"

"2f  coXrse, it's me. I'm very late, days late. BXt it's me." Ernest paXsed. He
had e[pected anger and Zas throZn off by her pleasant tone. "YoX seem
sXrprised," he added.

"9ery sXrprised. I never thoXght to hear yoXr voice again."

"I mXst see yoX. Things seem Xnreal, bXt the soXnd of yoXr voice is Zaking
me Xp. We have mXch to do: me, a lot of apologi]ing and e[plaining; and
yoX, a lot of forgiving."

"2f  coXrse, I'll see yoX. BXt on one condition. 1o e[plaining or forgiving—
they're not needed."

"Dinner tomorroZ? Eight?"

230
"Fine. I'll cook."

"1o."  Ernest remembered his sXspicions aboXt the chanterelle steZ. "0y
tXrn. /eave dinner to me."

He arrived at Artemis's home laden Zith takeoXt dishes from the 1anking, a
hole-in-the-Zall on .earny  Zith  San Francisco's Zorst decor and best
Cantonese food. By natXre a feeder, he eagerly laid the varioXs packages
oXt on the table, identifying each for Artemis. He Zas crestfallen Zhen she
told him she Zas a vegan and ZoXld have to pass on many of the dishes,
inclXding the sXperb 5olling /ettXce Chicken and Five 0Xshroom Beef.
Thank God, Ernest chanted silently, for the rice, the steamed pea sproXts
and the vegetarian dXmplings!

"I have some things to say to yoX and I'm not knoZn for reserve," he said,
as they sat doZn at her table. "0y friends all say I'm a compXlsive revealer,
so I Zarn yoX, here goes—"

"5emember my conditions," Artemis pXt her hand Xpon Ernest's arm, "no
apologies, no e[plaining needed."

"1ot  sXre I can honor the conditions, Artemis. As I told yoX the other night,
I take my Zork as a healer very serioXsly. It's me, it's my life, and I can't
sZitch it on and off. So, I'm absolXtely mortified at the damage I've inflicted
on yoX. I acted inhXmanly. For Xs to make sXch love—beaXtifXl love, love
that I've never imagined possible— and then to desert yoX ZithoXt a Zord,
it's indefensible—I can't pXt it any other Zay—I acted inhXmanly. 0y
thoXghtlessness mXst have devastated yoX. YoX mXst have Zondered again
and again Zhat land of man I am and Zhy I treated yoX so vilely."

"I've told yoX before, I don't Zorry aboXt sXch things. 1atXrally I Zas
disappointed bXt I Xnderstood fXlly. Ernest," she added gravely, "I knoZ
Zhy yoX left me that night."

"YoX knoZ do yoX?" Ernest said playfXlly, finding her naivete charming. "I
don't believe yoX knoZ as mXch as yoX think yoX do aboXt that night."

226

"I'm certain," she said emphatically, "I knoZ far more than yoX think I do."

"Artemis, yoX coXldn't even imagine Zhat happened to me that night. HoZ
coXld yoX? I left yoX becaXse of a dream—a horrible, and very private
vision. What can yoX knoZ of it?"

"I knoZ  it all, Ernest. I knoZ aboXt the cat and aboXt the poisonoXs Zater
and aboXt the statXe standing in the middle of the lake."

"YoX're making my blood rXn cold, Artemis!" Ernest e[claimed. "That Zas
my dream. Dreams are a private domain, each person's most private,
sovereign sanctXary. HoZ coXld yoX knoZ my dream?."

Artemis sat silent, head boZed.

"And so many other TXestions, Artemis. The depth of my feelings that
evening—that magical gloZ, that irresistible desire. 1ot to take anything
aZay from yoX and yoXr charm, bXt that desire Zas of an XnnatXral
intensity. CoXld it have been chemical? 0aybe the chanterelles?"

232
Artemis boZed her head loZer.

"And then Zhen Ze Zere in bed, I toXched yoXr cheek. Why Zere yoX
Zeeping? I felt ZonderfXl; I thoXght it Zas mXtXal. Why the tears? Wiry
pain for yoX?"

"I Zasn't crying for me, Ernest, bXt for yoX. And not becaXse of Zhat had
happened betZeen Xs—that Zas ZonderfXl for me, too. 1o, I Zept becaXse
of Zhat Zas aboXt to happen to yoX."

"AboXt to happen? Am I going mad? This is getting Zorse and Zorse.
Artemis, tell me the trXth!"

"I don't think the trXth Zill  satisfy yoX, Ernest."

"Try me. TrXst me."

Artemis stood Xp, left the room briefly, and retXrned Zith a vellXm folder,
from Zhich she e[tracted a sheaf of paper, yelloZed and old. "The trXth?
The trXth is here," she said, holding it oXt, "in this letter my grandmother
Zrote a long time ago to my mother, 0agda. It's dated -Xne 13, 1931. Shall
I read it to yoX, Ernest."

She nodded. And, by the light of three candles as, the redolent

food Zaited in its containers, Ernest listened to Artemis's grandmother's
story, the story- behind his dream.

To 0agda, my dear daXghter, on her seventeenth birthday, in the hope that
this message is neither too late nor too early.

It is time for yoX to knoZ the ansZers to the important TXestions in yoXr
life. Where have Ze come from? Why have yoX been Xprooted so many
times? Who and Zhere is yoXr father? Why have I sent yoX aZay and not
kept yoX Zith me? The family history, Zhich I Zrite  here, is something yoX
mXst knoZ and mXst pass on to yoXr daXghters.

233
I greZ Xp in 8jepest, a feZ miles oXtside of BXdapest. 0y father, -anos,
yoXr grandfather, Zorked as a machinist in a large plant that assembled
bXses. When I Zas seventeen, I moved to BXdapest. I had several reasons.
For one thing, BXdapest offered better jobs for a yoXng Zoman. BXt the
main reason, and I am ashamed to tell yoX this aboXt yoXr oZn family, is
that my father Zas like an animal, preying on his oZn child. He made
repeated advances to me Zhen I Zas too yoXng to defend myself, and
finally despoiled me Zhen I Zas thirteen. 0y  mother kneZ aboXt this bXt
pretended not to knoZ, and refXsed to defend me. In BXdapest, I moved in
Zith my 8ncle  /as]lo,   my father's brother, and AXnt -Xliska, Zho arranged
a position for me to assist her in the hoXse Zhere she Zorked as a cook. I
learned to cook and to bake and, a feZ years later, took AXnt -Xliska's place
Zhen she became sick Zith consXmption. When AXnt -Xliska died the ne[t
year, 8ncle /as]lo  behaved like my father and demanded that I take AXnt
-Xliska's place beside him in bed. I coXldn't endXre that and so moved oXt
on my oZn. EveryZhere men Zere predator}-—like animals. Everyone, the
other servants, the deliver}- boy, the bXtcher made leZd comments and
leered and tried to toXch me Zhenever I passed. Even the master tried to pXt
his hand Xnder my skirts.

I moved to 23 9aci 8t in the center of BXdapest near the DanXbe, and there,
for the ne[t ten years, I lived alone. 0en leered and groped me Zherever I
Zent, and I protected myself by pXlling my Zorld in aroXnd me, making it
smaller and smaller. I stayed Xnmarried and lived my small happy life Zith

228

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

my cat, Cica. And then a monster, 0r. .ovacs, moved into the Xpstairs flat
and Zith him his cat, 0erges. 0erges means "ragefX"l in HXngarian
[Artemis dreZ the name oXt Zith a 0agyar intonation — 0are-Gesh],  and
that beast Zas Zell named. He Zas a vicioXs, hideoXs, black-and-Zhite cat
direct from Hell and terrori]ed my poor Cica. 2ver  and over Cica retXrned
home cXt and bleeding. She lost an eye to infection, one of her ears Zas half
torn off.

234
And .ovacs  terrori]ed me. I barricaded my doors at night against him. And
closed the shXtters becaXse he Zandered aroXnd the oXtside of the hoXse
peering in throXgh every crack. Every time Ze met in the hall, he tried to
force himself on me, so I made sXre to avoid crossing paths Zith him. BXt I
Zas helpless; I coXldn't complain to anyone-.ovacs Zas a police sergeant.
A vXlgar, rapacioXs man. I'll tell yoX Zhat land of man he Zas. 2nce I pXt
aside my pride and pleaded Zith him to keep 0erges inside for only an hoXr
a day so Cica coXld go oXt in safety. "1othing Zrong Zith 0erges," he
sneered. "0y cat and I are alike, Ze both Zant the same thing—sZeet
HXngarian pXssy." Yes, he ZoXld agree to keep 0erges at home—for a
price. And the price Zas me!

Things Zere bad, bXt every time Cica entered heat, they got even Zorse.
1ot only did  .ovacs  do his XsXal proZling aroXnd my ZindoZs and
knocking on my door, bXt 0erges Zent berserk: all night long screeching,
yoZling, scratching at the Zall of my hoXse, and flinging himself against
my ZindoZs.

As if 0erges  and .ovacs Zere not pestilence enoXgh, BXdapest at that time
Zas infested by hXge DanXbe river rats, Zhich sZarmed throXgh my
neighborhood, pillaged the potato and carrot bins in the cellar, and
slaXghtered the backyard chickens. 2ne day my landlord helped me set a
trap-cage for the rats in the cellar, and that very night I heard Xngodly
sTXeals. Descending the stairs by candlelight, I Zas fXll of fear. What ZoXld
I do Zith the rat or rats I had caXght? Then, by the flickering candle, I saZ
the cage and, peering oXt from its bars, the largest, most horrible rat I had
ever seen or, in mv Zorst dreams, imagined. I fleZ back Xp the stairs and
decided to call for help Zhen my landlord aZoke. BXt an hoXr later, as
daZn broke, I

ventXred back doZn and took another look. It Zas no rat. It Zas Zorse—it
Zas 0erges! As soon as he saZ me, he hissed and spit and tried to claZ me
throXgh the bars of the cage. God, Zhat a monster! I kneZ jXst Zhat to do,
and it Zas Zith great pleasXre that I threZ an entire pitcher of Zater on him.
He kept on hissin,g and I picked Xp my skirts and pranced Zith joy three
times aroXnd the cage.

235
BXt then Zhat? What shoXld I do Zith 0erges, Zho noZ Zas hoZling  an
Xngodly song. Something Zithin me made the decision ZithoXt my
knoZing it. For the first time in  my life, I ZoXld  take a stand. For me! For
Zomen everyZhere! I ZoXld fight  back. I pXt an old blanket over the cage,
lifted it by the handle, Zalked oXt of the hoXse—the streets still empty, no
one Xp yet— and marched to the train station. I boXght a ticket for Es]ter-
gom, aboXt an hoXr aZay, bXt then, deciding it Zas not far enoXgh, I rode
all the Zay to S]eged, aboXt tZo hXndred kilometers aZay. When I got off
the train, I Zalked a feZ blocks, then stopped, took the cover off the cage,
and prepared to release 0erges.

As I looked at him, his eyes slashed at me— sharp, like a ra]or, and I
shXddered. There Zas something aboXt his Zild look, so hatefXl, so
relentless, that I kneZ then, Zith an eerie certainty, that Cica and I ZoXld
never be free of him. Animals have been knoZn to retXrn home from across
a continent. 1o matter hoZ far I took 0erges, he ZoXld retXrn. He ZoXld
track Xs from the ends of the earth. I picked Xp the cage and Zalked a feZ
sTXares farther Xntil I came to the DanXbe. I Zalked to the center of the
bridge, Zaited Xntil there Zas no one in sight, and threZ the cage into the
Zater. It floated for an instant, then began to sink As it sank loZer in the
Zater, 0erges never stopped looking at me and hissing. Finally the DanXbe
stilled him, and I Zaited Xntil I saZ no more bXbbles, Xntil he had reached
his riverbed grave, Xntil I Zas safe forever from the hellcat. Then I boarded
a train for home.

2n the ride back, I thoXght of .ovacs, of his retaliation, and I Zas terrified.
When I retXrned, his ZindoZs Zere still shXttered. He Zas then Zorking
nights, had slept throXgh 0erges's e[odXs, and ZoXld never, never knoZ of
my act of defiance. For

230

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

the first time in my life, I felt  free.

BXt not for long. That night, an hoXr or tZo after I fell asleep, I heard
0erges's yoZling  oXtside. It Zas, of coXrse, a dream, bXt a dream so vivid,

236
so tangible, that it Zas more real than my life aZake. I heard 0erges
claZing and scraping a hole in the Zall of my bedroom. Staring at the
splintering Zall, I  saZ his paZ thrXst into the room. 0ore scraping, plaster
falling all over my room. Then 0erges bXrst into my bedroom. A big cat to
start Zith, he had groZn to noZ doXble, maybe triple his old si]e. Soaking
Zet, the dirty Zater of the DanXbe still dripping off him, he spoke to me.

The beast's Zord are fro]en in my mind. "I am old, yoX mXrdering bitch,"
he hissed, " and I have already lived eight of my lives. I have a single life
lef,t and I sZear here and noZ to dedicate it to revenge. I Zill dZell in the
dream dimensio,n and I Zill haXnt yoX and yoXr female descendants
forever. YoX separated me forever from Cica, the beZitching Cica, the great
passion of my life, and noZ I Zill  make certain that yoX Zill forever be
separated from any man Zho ever shoZs an interest in yoX. I'll visit them
Zhen they are Zith yoX"— here he hissed most terribly— "and drive them
from yoX in sXch terror that they Zill never retXrn— they Zill forget yoXr
very e[istence."

At first I  felt e[Xltant. StXpid cat! Cats are, after all, simple-minded,
pinheaded animals. 0erges had no real Xnderstanding of me. His brilliant
revenge—that I ZoXld no longer be able to be Zith a man tZice! 1ot
revenge bXt a blessing, a blessing e[ceeded only by my being forbidden to
be Zith a man even once. 1ever again to toXch or even see a man—that
ZoXld be paradise.

BXt I soon foXnd that 0erges Zas not simpleminded—far from it. He coXld
read thoXghts, I am sXre of it. He sat on his haXnches, stroking his Zhiskers,
staring at me Zith his enormoXs red eyes for a very long time Zhile. Then
he proclaimed, this time in a strangely hXman voice, soXnding like a jXdge
or a prophet, "What yoX feel toZard men Zill be changed forever. 1oZ yoX
shall knoZ desire. YoX shall be like a cat, and Zhen yoXr heat comes each
month, yoXr desire Zill be irresistible. BXt never fXlfilled. YoX Zill please
men, bXt never be pleased, and

each man yoX please Zill leave yoX, never to retXrn or even to remember
yoX. YoX shall bear a child, and yoXr child's child shall knoZ Zhat I and
.ovacs  feel. This shall be for all time."

237
"For all time?" I asked. "SXch a long sentence?"

"For all time," he replied. "What greater offense than in separating me
forever from the love of my life?"

SXddenly overcome, I began to tremble and beg for yoX, my Xnborn
daXghter. "3lease pXnish me, 0erges. I deserve it for Zhat I did to yoX. I
deserve a loveless life. BXt my children and my children's children, I beg
yoX." And I boZed loZ  before him and pressed my forehead to the groXnd.

"There is only one e[it for yoXr children. 1one for yoX."

"What is the e[it?" I asked.

"5edress the Zrong," said 0erges, noZ licking—Zith   a tongXe larger than
my hand—his monstroXs paZs and cleaning his hideoXs face.

"5edress the Zrong? HoZ? What shoXld they do?" I moved toZard him,
pleading.

BXt 0erges hissed and brandished his Xnsheathed claZs. As I stepped back,
he faded aZay. The last thing I saZ of him Zere those terrible claZs.

This, 0agda, Zas my cXrse. 2Xr cXrse. It drove me to rXin. I greZ Zild
Zith desire and ran after men. I lost my position. 1o one ZoXld hire me.
0y  landlord evicted me. I had no Zay to sXrvive e[cept to sell my body.
And thanks to 0erges I had no retXrn trade. 0en Zho had once been Zith
me ZoXld never approach me again; they retained no memory of me, bXt
only of some vagXe terror connected Zith oXr meeting. Before long,
everyone in BXdapest despised me. 1o doctor ZoXld believe me. Even the
famoXs psychiatrist Sandor Ferenc]i coXld not help. He spoke of my
fevered imagination. I sZore that I spoke trXe. He reTXested proof, some
Zitness, some sign. BXt hoZ coXld I give proof? 1o man I had loved coXld
remember me or the dream. I told Ferenc]i he ZoXld have his proof if he
ZoXld only spend an evening Zith me and see for himself. I had soXght him
oXt becaXse of the rXmor that he practiced "kissing therapy," bXt apparently
he so feared for his repXtation that he ZoXld have no part of my invitation.
Finally, in desperation, I emmigrated to

238
232

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

1eZ  York, hoping against hope that 0erges ZoXld not cross the Zater.

The rest yoX knoZ. A year later, I conceived yoX. I never kneZ Zho yoXr
father Zas. 1oZ yoX knoZ Zhy.  And noZ yoX knoZ  Zhy I coXld never
keep yoX Zith me and Zhy I sent yoX aZay to school. .noZing this,
0agda, yoX mXst decide on Zhat yoX Zill do Zhen yoX gradXate. YoX may,
of coXrse, alZays come to me in 1eZ York. Whatever yoX decide, I shall
continXe to send yoX money each month. In other Zays, I cannot help yoX. I
cannot help myself.

YoXr 0other, .lara

Artemis folded the letter carefXlly, placed it back in the vellXm folder, and
then looked Xp at Ernest. "1oZ yoX knoZ my grandmother. And me."

Ernest Zas both fascinated by the e[traordinary story he had jXst heard and
distracted by the into[icating aroma of the pXngent Chinese spices drifting
over to him. ThroXghoXt the reading, he had fXrtively eyed the steam
drifting Xp from the cooling containers, yet thoXgh he Zas famished, he
maintained good form and resisted the food. 1oZ enoXgh Zas enoXgh. He
passed the pea sproXts to Artemis and dXg his chopsticks into the Five
0Xshroom Beef.

"What aboXt yoXr mother, Artemis?" asked Ernest, chomping contentedly
on a slightly crisp bXt marveloXsly sXccXlent shitake mXshroom.

"She Zent into a convent bXt Zas ejected after a feZ years for noctXrnal
roaming. Then she entered my grandmother's profession. She sent me aZay
to school, and Zhen I Zas fifteen, she took her oZn life. It Zas my
grandmother, Zho lived tZenty years after my mother's death, Zho gave me
this letter."

"0erges's recipe for lifting  the cXrse—5edress the Zrong— did yoX ever
find oXt Zhat that meant?"

239
"0y  grandmother and mother pX]]led aboXt it for years bXt never solved
the mystery. 0y grandmother consXlted another

doctor, Dr. Brill, a famoXs 1eZ York psychiatrist, bXt he regarded her as
oXt of toXch Zith reality. Hysterical psychosis Zas his diagnosis, and he
advised her to take the Weir rest cXre—one to tZo years of total rest in a
sanitariXm. Given my grandmother's finances and the natXre of 0erges's
cXrse, it is obvioXs that it's Dr. Brill Zho Zas oXt of toXch Zith reality."

As Artemis began to pXt aZay the dishes, Ernest stopped her, "We can do
that later."

"3erhaps, Ernest," Artemis said, her voice tight and strained, "noZ that
dinner is over, yoX might like to come Xpstairs." A paXse, and she added,
"YoX knoZ noZ that I cannot keep myself from asking this."

"E[cXse me," Ernest said, rising and heading for the front door.

"Good-bye, then," Artemis called after him. "I knoZ. I Xnderstand
completely. 1o e[cXses necessary. And no gXilt, please."

"What do yoX knoZ, Artemis?" asked Ernest, looking back from the open
door. "Where am I going?"

"YoX're going far aZay and as fast as yoX can. And Zho can blame yoX. I
knoZ Zhy  yoX go. And I Xnderstand, Ernest."

"YoX see, Artemis, as I told yoX before, yoX don't knoZ as mXch as yoX
think yoX do. I'm going jXst tZenty feet to my car, from Zhich I intend to
fetch my overnight bag."

When he retXrned, she Zas Xpstairs bathing. He cleared the dinner table,
packed Xp the remaining food, and then, bag in hand, ascended the stairs.

The ne[t hoXr in the bedroom proved one thing: it Zasn't the chanterelle
steZ. All Zas as before. The Zarm lXsh lXst, the cat licking, the sensXoXs
tongXe, the FoXrth of -Xly fireZorks sloZly bXilding Xp to their pyrotechnic
clima[,  the incandescent roman candles, the roar of the hoZit]er. For a feZ

240
moments Ernest Zas visited by e[traordinary flashbacks: all the past
orgasms of his life sZooooshing throXgh him, years of jerking spasms into
palms and roZels and sinks, and then Zatching a procession of the large-
breasted lovers, lovely vessels of consolation, into Zhom he had

234

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

drained the cares of his life. GratitXde! GratitXde! And then blackness, as he
fell into the sleep of the dead.

Ernest Zas aZakened by 0erges's hoZling. Again, he felt the room shake;
again, the scratching and scraping at the Zall of the hoXse. Fear flickered,
bXt he got TXickly oXt of bed and—shaking his head vigoroXsly and
inhaling deeply—calmly opened the ZindoZ Zide, leaned oXt, called, "This
Zay, this Zay, 0erges. Save yoXr claZs. The ZindoZ is open."

SXdden silence. Then 0erges boXnded in, ripping and shredding the thin
linen cXrtains. Hissing, his head raised, his red eyes bla]ing, his glistening
claZs Xnsheathed, he circled Ernest.

"I've been e[pecting yoX, 0erges. Won't yoX please sit doZn?" Ernest
settled into a massive redZood bXrl chair ne[t to the night table, beyond
Zhich all Zas darkness. The bed, Artemis, and the rest of the room had
vanished.

0erges stopped hissing. He looked Xp at Ernest, spittle dripping from his
fangs, his mXscles tensed.

Ernest reached into his overnight bag. "Won't yoX have something to eat,
0erges?" he said, opening some of the dinner containers he had carried
Xpstairs.

0erges peered caXtioXsly into the first container. "Five 0Xshroom Beef! I
hate mXshrooms. That's Zhy she alZays makes them. That chanterelle
ragoXt!" He Xttered these last Zords in a high-pitched, mocking singsong,
then repeated them, "Chanterelle ragoXt! Chanterelle ragoXt!"

241
"Here, here," Ernest said, in the soothing drone he Xsed sometimes in a
therapy session. "/et me pick oXt the beef pieces for yoX. 2h, my God, I am
so sorry! I coXld have gotten the Zhole baked cod. 2r the 3eking DXck.
Even the HXnan 0eatballs. 3erhaps the 3ork ShXe 0ai. 2r the Beggar's
Chicken. 2r the 0ing's  beef. 2r the—"

"All  right, all right"  0erges snarled. He sZiped at the chXnks of beef and
devoXred them in a single gXlp.

Ernest droned on: "2r I coXld have gotten the Seafood Delight, the salted
shrimp, the Zhole roasted crab, the—"

"YoX coXld have, yoX coXld have, yoX coXld have, bXt yoX didn't, did yoX?
And even if yoX had, then so Zhat? Is that Zhat yoX think? That some stale
scraps ZoXld redress the Zrong? That I ZoXld settle for leftovers? That I
am nothing bXt brXte appetite?"

0erges and Ernest stared silently at one another for a moment. Then
0erges nodded toZard the container Zith the 5olling Chicken and Cilantro
in /ettXce CXps. "And Zhat's in there?"

"It's called 5olling  Chicken. DelicioXs. Here, let me pick oXt the chicken
for yoX."

"1o, leave it be," said 0erges, batting the container oXt of Ernest's hand. "I
like the green stXff. I come from a family of Bavarian grass eaters. Hard to
find good grass that's not soaked in dog piss." 0erges gobbled doZn the
cilantro and chicken, then licked the lettXce cXps clean. "1ot bad. So yoX
coXld've gotten roast crab?"

"I only Zish  I had, bXt as it Zas, I got too mXch meat. TXrns oXt Artemis is
a vegan."

"9egan?"

"A vegetarian Zho eats no animal prodXcts at all—not even dairy prodXcts."

242
"So she's stXpid as Zell as a mXrdering bitch. And I remind yoX again that
yoX're stXpid, too, if yoX think yoX'll redress the Zrong by coXrting my
stomach."

"1o, 0erges,  I don't think that. BXt I fXlly Xnderstand Zhy yoX'd be
sXspicioXs of me or anyone Zho approaches yoX in a friendly fashion. YoX
haven't been treated Zell in yoXr life."

"/ives  —not life.  I've had eight of them, and every one, ZithoXt e[ception,
has ended the same Zay—in Xnspeakable crXelty and mXrder. /ook at the
last one! Artemis mXrdered me! ThreZ me into a cage and nonchalantly
tossed it into the river and Zatched me sink sloZly Xntil the filthy Zater of
the DanXbe covered my nostrils. The last thing I saZ in that life Zas her
triXmphant leer as my final breath bXbbled oXt of me. And do yoX knoZ
Zhat my crime Zas?"

Ernest shook his head.

236

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

"0y  crime Zas that I Zas being a cat."

"0erges, yoX're not any ordinary cat. YoX are an XnXsXally intelligent cat. I
hope I may speak frankly to yoX."

0erges, Zho Zas licking  the sides of the empty 5olling Chicken container,
groZled assent.

"TZo things I mXst say. First, of coXrse, yoX reali]e it Zas not Artemis Zho
droZned yoX. It Zas her grandmother, .lara, noZ long dead. Secondly—"

"She smells the same to me—Artemis is .lara in a later life. Didn't yoX
knoZ that?"

Ernest Zas throZn off gXard. 1eeding time to ponder that notion, he merely
continXed, "Secondly, .lara did not hate cats. In fact, she loved a cat. She

243
Zas no mXrderer: it Zas in her effort to save the life of Cica, her oZn dear
cat, that she acted against yoX."

1o ansZer. Ernest coXld hear 0erges breathing. Am I, he Zondered, being
too confrontational, not shoZing enoXgh empathy? "BXt," he said gently,
"perhaps this is all beside the point. I think Ze shoXld stick to Zhat yoX said
a minXte ago—that yoXr only crime Zas being a cat."

"5ight!  I did Zhat I  did becaXse I am a cat. Cats protect their tXrf, they
attack other, threatening cats, and the best of the cats— those bXrsting Zith
catness-let nothing, nothing, stand in their Zay Zhen they Zhiff the sZeet
mXskiness of a cat in heat. I Zas doing nothing more than fXlfilling my
catness."

0erges's comment gave Ernest paXse. Wasn't 0erges being trXe to Ernest's
favorite of 1iet]sche's ma[ims:  "Become he Zho yoX are?" Wasn't 0erges
right? Wasn't he simply fXlfilling his oZn feline potential?

"There Zas once a famoXs philosopher," Ernest began, "that is, a Zise man
or a thinker—"

"I knoZ  Zhat a philosopher is." The cat broke in, crossly. "In one of my
first lives, I lived in  FreibXrg and made nighttime visits to 0artin
Heidegger's home."

"YoX kneZ Heidegger? said Ernest, ama]ed.

"1o, no. Heidegger's cat, ;anthippe. She Zas something! Hot! Cica, hot as
she Zas, Zas nothing compared to ;anthippe. It Zas many lives ago, bXt I
remember Zell that army of heavyZeight TeXtonic bXllies I had to battle to
get to her. Tomcats came all the Zay from 0arbXrg Zhen ;anthippe
entered heat. Ah, those Zere the days!"

"Well, let me finish my point, 0erges."  Ernest tried not to alloZ himself to
be distracted. The famoXs philosopher I'm thinking of—he Zas German, too
—often said that one mXst become Zho one is, mXst fXlfill one's ordained
destiny or potential. Isn't that e[actly Zhat yoX Zere doing? YoX Zere
fXlfilling  yoXr basic catness. Where is the crime in that?"

244
At Ernest's first Zords, 0erges had opened his moXth to protest, bXt sloZly
closed it again Zhen he reali]ed that Ernest Zas agreeing Zith him. He
began grooming himself Zith Zide sZipes of his tongXe.

"There is, hoZever," Ernest continXed, "a problematic parado[ here—a
fXndamental conflict of interest—in that .lara Zas doing e[actly  Zhat yoX
Zere doing: becoming herself. She Zas a nXrtXrer and protector and cared
for nothing in the Zorld more than her cat. She Zanted only to protect Cica
and keep her safe. ThXs, .lara's actions Zere all in the service of fXlfilling
her oZn basic loving natXre."

"Hmmpf!"  scoffed 0erges. "Do yoX knoZ that .lara  refXsed to mate Zith
my master, .ovacs, Zho Zas a very strong man? -Xst becaXse .lara hated
men, she assXmed that Cica did, too. Hence, there is no parado[. .lara
acted not for Cica bXt in the service of her illXsion aboXt Zhat Cica Zanted.
Believe me, Zhen Cica Zas in heat, she Zas hot for me! .lara Zas
Xnspeakably crXel to keep Xs apart."

"BXt .lara  feared for her cat's life. Cica had sXffered many grievoXs
ZoXnds."

"WoXnds? WoXnds? 0ere scratches. Toms intimidate and sXbdXe the lady.
Toms claZ the hell oXt of other toms. That's hoZ Ze Zoo. That is catdom.
We are being cats. Who is .lara, Zho

238

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

are yoX, to jXdge and condemn catness?"

Ernest backed off. 1othing there, he decided. He tried another tack.
"0erges, a feZ minXtes ago yoX said that Artemis and .lara Zere the same,
and that Zas Zhy yoX continXed to haXnt .lara."

"0y  nose does not He."

245
"When, in one of yoXr early lives, yoX died, did yoX remain dead for a
Zhile before entering another life?"

"2nly  for an instant. Then I Zas reborn into another life. Don't ask me hoZ.
There are some things even cats don't knoZ."

"Well, even so, yoX're certain that yoX're in one life, then cease to be, and
then enter another. Correct?"

"Yes, yes, get on Zith it!" 0erges groZled.  /ike  all ninth-lifers,  he had little
patience Zith picayXne semantic discXssions.

"BXt, since for some years Artemis and her grandmother, .lara, Zere both
alive at the same time and spoke to each other many times, hoZ can
Artemis and .lara  be the same person in different lives. It's not possible. I
don't mean to TXestion yoXr nose, bXt perhaps yoX Zere sensing the genetic
connection betZeen the tZo Zomen."

0erges silendy considered Ernest's comment as he continXed to groom
himself, licking a massive paZ and scrXbbing his face Zith its dampness.

"I Zas jXst thinking, 0erges, is it  possible yoX didn't knoZ that Ze hXmans
have only one life?"

"HoZ can yoX be so sXre?"

"Well, that's Zhat Ze believe. And isn't that the important thing?"

"3erhaps yoX have many lives and don't knoZ it."

"YoX say yoX remember yoXr other lives. We don't. If Ze have neZ lives
and don't remember the old ones, then it still means that this life—this
e[isting me, the conscioXsness that is here right noZ—is going to perish."

"The point! The point!" The beast groZled. "Get on Zith it. God, hoZ  yoX
talk and talk and talk."

"The point is that yoXr revenge Zas ZonderfXlly effective. It

246
Zas good revenge. It rXined the rest of .lara's one and only life. She lived
in great misery. And her crime Zas only to take one of yoXr nine lives. Her
sole life for one of yoXr nine lives. Seems to me the debt has been paid
many times over. YoXr revenge is complete. The slate is clean. The Zrong
redressed." E[Xltant at his persXasive formXlation, Ernest leaned back in his
chair.

"1o,"  hissed 0erges, gloZering and thXmping the floor Zith his poZerfXl
tail. "1o,  it is not complete! 1ot complete! The Zrong has not been
redressed! 5evenge Zill go on and on! Besides, I like the Zay this life
goes."

Ernest didn't alloZ himself to flinch. He rested a moment or tZo, caXght his
second Zind, and began again from another perspective.

"YoX say yoX like the Zay yoXr life goes noZ. Will yoX tell me aboXt yoXr
life? What is yoXr typical day like?"

Ernest's XnrXffled manner seemed to rela[ 0erges Zho stopped gloZering,
sat back on his haXnches, and responded calmly. "0y day? 8neventfXl. I
don't remember mXch of my life."

"What do yoX do all day?"

"I Zait.  I Zait Xntil I  am called bv a dream."

-

"And betZeen dreams?"

"I told yoX. I Zait."

"That's it?"

"I Zait."

"And that's yoXr life, 0erges? And are yoX satisfied?"

247
0erges nodded. "When yoX consider the alternative," he said, as he
gracefXlly rolled over and set to Zork grooming his belly..

"The alternative? YoX mean not living?"

"The ninth life is the last."

"And yoX Zant this last life to go on and on forever."

"WoXldn't yoX? WoXldn't anyone?"

"0erges, I'm strXck by an inconsistency in Zhat yoX're say-ing."

"Cats are highly logical beings. Sometimes that is not appreciated becaXse
of oXr ability to make lightning TXick decisions."

240

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

"Here's the inconsistency- YoX say yoX Zant yoXr ninth life to go on and on,
bXt in fact yoX're not living yoXr ninth life. YoX're merely e[isting in some
state of sXspended animation."

"1ot  living my ninth life?"

"YoX said it yoXrself: yoX're Zaiting. I'll tell yoX Zhat comes to my mind. A
famoXs psychologist once said that some people so fear the debt of death
that they refXse the loan of life."

"0eaning  Zhat? Talk plainly," said 0erges Zho had stopped grooming his
belly and noZ sat on his haXnches.

"0eaning  that yoX seem so fearfXl of death that yoX refrain from entering
into life. It's as thoXgh yoX fear Xsing Xp life. 5emember Zhat yoX taXght
me jXst a feZ minXtes ago aboXt essential catness? Tell me, 0erges, Zhere
is the territory yoX defend? Where are the toms yoX battle? Where are the
lXstfXl, hoZling females yoX sXbdXe? And Zhy," Ernest asked, emphasi]ing
each Zord, "doyoX alloZ yoXr precioXs 0erges spermseeds to rot XnXsed?'''

248
As Ernest spoke, 0erges's head boZed loZ. Then, someZhat moXrnfXlly, he
asked, "And yoX have only one life? HoZ far are yoX into it?"

"AboXt halfZay throXgh."

"HoZ can yoX stand it?"

SXddenly Ernest felt a sharp pang of sadness. He reached for one of the
napkins from the Chinese dinner and dabbed at his eyes.

"I'm sorry," said 0erges, Xne[pectedly gendy, "to have caXsed pain."

"1ot  at all. I Zas prepared, as this tXrn in oXr conversation Zas inevitable,"
Ernest said. YoX ask hoZ I can stand it? Well, first of all, by not thinking
aboXt it. And more, sometimes I even forget aboXt it. And at my age that's
not too hard."

"At yoXr age? What does that mean?"

"We hXmans go throXgh life in stages. As very yoXng children, Ze think
aboXt death a great deal, some of Xs even obsess aboXt it. It's not hard to
discover death. We simply look aroXnd and see dead things: leaves and
lilies and flies and beedes. 3ets die. We eat

dead animals. Sometimes Ze're privy to the death of a person. And before
long, Ze reali]e that death Zill  come to everyone—to oXr grandma, to oXr
mother and father, even to oXrselves. We brood aboXt this in private. 2Xr
parents and teachers, thinking it's bad for children to think aboXt death,
keep silent aboXt it or give Xs fairy tales aboXt a heaven and angels, eternal
reXnion, immortal soXls." Ernest stopped, hoping that 0erges Zas
folloZing  his Zords.

"And then?" 0erges Zas folloZing,  all  right.

"We comply. We pXsh it oXt of oXr minds, or Ze openly defy death Zith
great feats of daredevilry. And then jXst before Ze become adXlts, Ze brood
a great deal aboXt it again. AlthoXgh some cannot bear it and refXse to go
on living, most of Xs pXt aside oXr aZareness of death and immerse

249
oXrselves in the tasks of adXlthood—bXilding a career and family, personal
groZth, acTXiring possessions, e[ercising poZer, Zinning the race. That's
Zhere I am noZ in life. After  that stage, Ze enter the later era of life, Zhere
aZareness of death emerges again and noZ is distinctly menacing— in fact,
imminent. At that point, Ze have the choice of thinking aboXt it a great deal
and making the most of the life Ze still have, or pretending in varioXs Zays
that death is not coming at all."

"So, Zhat aboXt yoX, yoXrself? Do yoX pretend to yoXrself that death Zill
not come?"

"1o, I  can't really do that. Since, in my Zork as a psychiatrist, I talk to
many people Zho are terribly troXbled, I have to face it all the time."

"/et  me ask yoX again, then"—0erges's voice, noZ soft and Zeary, had lost
all its menace—"hoZ yoX stand it? HoZ can yoX take pleasXre from any
part of life, any activity at all, Zith  death looming ahead and only one life?"

"I'd tXrn that TXestion Xpside doZn, 0erges. 3erhaps death makes life more
vital, more precioXs. The fact of death bestoZs a special poignancy, a
bittersZeet TXality, to life's activities. Yes, it may be trXe that living in the
dream dimension confers immortality Xpon yoX, bXt yoXr life seems to me
to be soaked in ennXi. When I asked

242

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

yoX, a Zhile back, to describe yoXr life, yoX ansZered Zith the single
phrase: 'I Zait.' Is that life? Is Zaiting living? YoX still have one life left,
0erges. Why not live it  to the fXllest?"

"I cannot! I cannot!" 0erges said, boZing  his head deeper. "The thoXght of
no longer e[isting, of not being among the living, of life going on ZithoXt
me, is—is—simply too terrible."

"So the point of the cXrse is not perpetXal revenge, is it? YoX Xse the cXrse
to avoid coming to the end of yoXr last life."

250
"It is simply too terrible to jXst end. To not be."

"I have learned in my Zork," said Ernest reaching over and patting 0erges's
great paZ, "that those Zho most fear death are the ones Zho approach it
Zith too mXch Xnlived life inside them. It's best to Xse all of life. /eave
death nothing bXt the dregs, nothing bXt a bXrned-oXt castle."

"1o, no,"  moaned 0erges shaking his head, "it is simply too terrible."

"Why so terrible? /et's analy]e precisely Zhat's so fearfXl aboXt death.
YoX've already e[perienced it more than once. YoX said that each time yoXr
life ended, there Zas a brief interval before the ne[t life began."

"Yes, that's right."

"What do yoX remember of those brief moments."

"AbsolXtely nothing."

"BXt isn't that the point, 0erges? 0Xch of Zhat yoX fear aboXt death is hoZ
yoX imagine it might feel to be dead and yet to knoZ that yoX can no longer
be among the living. BXt Zhen yoX're dead, yoX have no conscioXsness.
Death is the e[tingXishing of conscioXsness."

"Is that sXpposed to be reassXring?" 0erges groZled.

"YoX asked me hoZ I can stand it? That's one of my ansZers. I've also
alZays gotten comfort from the ma[im of another philosopher, Zho lived a
long, long time ago: 'Where death is, I am not; Zhere I am, death is not'."

"Is that any different from 'When yoX're dead, yoX're dead'?"

"A big difference. In death there is no 'yoX.' 'YoX' and 'dead'

cannot coe[ist."

"Heavy, heavy stXff," 0erges said, his voice barely aXdible, his head almost
toXching the floor.

251
"/et  me tell yoX aboXt another perspective that helps me, 0erges,
something I learned from a 5Xssian Zriter—"

"Those 5Xssians—this isn't going to be cheery."

"/isten.  Years, centXries, millennia, passed before I Zas born. 5ight?"

"1o denying that." 0erges  nodded Zearily.

"And millennia Zill   pass after I'm dead. 5ight?"

0erges nodded again.

"ThXs, I pictXre my life as a brilliant spark betZeen tZo vast and identical
pools of darkness: the darkness e[isting before my birth and the darkness
folloZing  my death."

That seemed to strike home. 0erges Zas listening hard, his ears pricked Xp.

"And doesn't it astoXnd yoX, 0erges, hoZ mXch Ze dread the latter
darkness and hoZ indifferent Ze are to the first?"

SXddenly 0erges stood and opened his moXth in an enormoXs yaZn, his
fangs gleaming faindy in the moonlight streaming throXgh the ZindoZ.
"GXess I've got to be shXffling along," he said, and trXdged toZard the
ZindoZ  Zith a heavy, Xncadike gait.

"Wait, 0erges, there's more!"

"EnoXgh for today. A lot to ponder, even for a cat. 1e[t time, Ernest, the
roast crab. And more of that green-grass chicken."

"1e[t  time? What do yoX mean, 0erges, ne[t time? Haven't I redressed the
Zrong?"

"0aybe  yes, maybe no. I told yoX, too mXch to think aboXt all at once. I'm
oXt of here!"

252
Ernest plopped back into his chair. He Zas pooped, his patience e[haXsted.
1ever before had he had a more nerve-Zracking and e[haXsting session.
And noZ to see it all go for naXght! Watching 0erges trXdge off Ernest
mXttered to himself, "Go! Go!" And then added "Geh GesXnter Heit" —
that Yiddish, mocking, phrase of his mother.

244

The HXngarian Cat CXrse

At the Zords, 0erges stopped dead in his tracks and tXrned back. "I heard
that."

8h-oh, thoXght Ernest. BXt he held his head high and faced the oncoming
0erges.

"Yes, I heard yoX. I heard yoX say, 'Geh GesXnter Heit.'' And I knoZ Zhat
that means—didn't yoX knoZ that I speak good German? YoX blessed me.
Even thoXgh yoX didn't imagine I ZoXld hear, yoX Zished me to go in good
health. And I am moved by yoXr blessing. 9ery moved. I knoZ Zhat I've
pXt yoX throXgh. I knoZ hoZ mXch yoX Zant to liberate this Zoman—not
only for her sake bXt also for yoXrs. And yet even after yoXr tremendoXs
effort, and after yoXr not knoZing Zhether yoX Zere sXccessfXl in
redressing the Zrong, even then yoX still had the grace and the loving-
kindness to Zish for my good health. That may be the most generoXs gift I
have ever received. Good-bye, my friend."

"Good-bye, 0erges," said Ernest, Zatching 0erges stroll aZay, more perky
noZ and Zith a gracefXl cat gait. Is it my imagination, he thoXght, or has
0erges groZn appreciably smaller?

"3erhaps Ze'll meet again," said 0erges, ZithoXt breaking stride. "I'm
considering settling in California."

"YoX have my Zord, 0erges," Ernest called after him. "YoX'll eat Zell here.
5oast crab—and cilantro—every night."

253
Darkness again. The ne[t thing Ernest saZ Zas the roseate gloZ of daZn.
1oZ  I knoZ  the meaning of a "hard day's night," he thoXght, as he sat Xp in
bed, stretched, and contemplated the sleeping Artemis. He felt certain that
0erges ZoXld depart from the dream dimension. BXt Zhat aboXt the rest of
the cat cXrse? 1one of that had been discXssed. For a feZ minXtes. Ernest
considered the prospect of being involved Zith a Zoman Zho might, every
so often, be se[Xally ferocioXs and voracioXs. 4Xietly he slipped oXt of bed,
dressed, and Zent doZnstairs.

Artemis hearing his footsteps, called oXt, "Ernest, no! Something's changed.
I'm free. I knoZ it.  I feel it. Don't go, please. YoX don't need to go."

"Be right back Zith breakfast. Ten minXtes," he called from

the front door. "I have an Xrgent need for an e[tra seedy bagel and cream
cheese. Yesterday I spotted a deli doZn the street."

He Zas jXst opening his car door Zhen he heard the bedroom ZindoZ go Xp
and Artemis's voice. "Ernest, Ernest, remember I'm a vegan. 1o cream
cheese. Can yoX get—"

"I knoZ—avocado. It's on my list."

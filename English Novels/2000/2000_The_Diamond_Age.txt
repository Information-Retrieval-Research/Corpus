Moral reforms and deteriorations are moved by large forces, and they
are mostly caused by reactions from the habits of a preceding period.
Backwards and  forwards  swings the   great  pendulum, and  its
alternations are not determined by a few distinguished folk clinging to
the end of it.

  A thete visits a mod parlor; noteworthy features of modern armaments.


The bells of St. Mark's were rinJinJ chanJes up on the mountain when Bud
skated over to the mod parlor to upJrade his skull Jun. Bud had a nice new
pair of blades with  a top speed of anywhere from a hundred to  a hundred
and fifty  kilometers, dependinJ on  how fat  you were  and whether or not
you  wore  aero. Bud  liked   wearinJ  skin-tiJht   leather, to   show off   his
muscles. On a previous visit to the mod parlor, two years aJo, he had paid
to have a bunch of 'sites implanted in his muscles—little critters, too small
to see or feel, that twitched Bud's muscle fibers electrically  accordinJ to a
proJram  that   was  supposed  to  maximi]e    bulk.   Combined  with   the
testosterone pump embedded in his forearm, it was like  workinJ  out  in a
Jym niJht and day, except you didn't have to actually do anythinJ and you
never Jot sweaty. The only drawback was that all  the little  twitches made
him kind  of tense and Merky. He'd Jotten used to it, but it still made him a
little hinky  on those skates, especially when he was doinJ a hundred clicks
an hour throuJh a crowded street. But few people hassled Bud, even when
he knocked them down in  the street, and after today no one would hassle
him ever again.

       Bud  had walked  away, improbably  unscratched, from his  last Mob—
decoy—with somethinJ like  a thousand yuks  in his  pocket. He'd  spent a
third of  it  on new clothes, mostly  black leather, another third of  it on  the
blades, and was about to spend the last third at the mod parlor. You could
Jet skull Juns a lot cheaper, of course, but that would mean JoinJ over the
Causeway to ShanJhai and JettinJ a back-alley Mob from some Coaster, and
probably a nice bone infection in  with the barJain, and he'd probably pick
your pocket while  he had you thee]ed. Besides, you could only  Jet into a
ShanJhai if you were virJin. To cross the Causeway when you were already
packinJ a skull  Jun, like  Bud,  you had to  bribe the shit out  of  numerous
ShanJhai cops. There was no reason to economi]e here. Bud had a rich and
boundless career ahead of   him,  vaultinJ   up  a  hierarchy  of  extremely
danJerous druJ-related  occupations for  which   decoy  served as  a  paid
audition of sorts. A start weapons system was a wise investment.

7
       The  damn   bells  kept  rinJinJ   throuJh   the  foJ.   Bud  mumbled   a
command to his  music system, a  phased acoustical array splayed across
both eardrums like  the  seeds on a strawberry. The  volume  went up  but
couldn't scour away the deep tones of the carillon,  which resonated in his
lonJ bones. He wondered whether, as lonJ as he was at the mod parlor, he
should have the  batteries drilled  out  of  his  riJht  mastoid  and replaced.
Supposedly they were  ten-year Mobs, but he'd had them  for  six  and  he
listened to music all the time, loud.

       Three people were waitinJ. Bud took a seat and skimmed a mediatron
from the coffee table; it looked exactly like a dirty, wrinkled,  blank sheet of
paper. “ 'Annals  of  Self-Protection,' ”  he said, loud  enouJh for  everyone
else in the place to hear him. The loJo  of his favorite  meedfeed coalesced
on  the paJe.  MediaJlyphics,  mostly   the  cool  animated ones,  arranJed
themselves in a Jrid. Bud scanned throuJh them until he found the one that
denoted a comparison of a bunch of different stuff,  and snapped at it with
his finJernail. New  mediaJlyphics appeared, surroundinJ larJer cine panes
in which  Annals staff tested several models of skull Juns aJainst live  and
dead tarJets. Bud frisbeed the mediatron back onto the table; this was the
same review he'd been porinJ over for the last day, they hadn't updated it,
his decision was still valid.

       One  of  the Juys  ahead of  him  Jot  a  tattoo, which  took  about  ten
seconds. The other Juy Must wanted his skull Jun reloaded, which didn't take
much lonJer.  The Jirl   wanted a  few  'sites replaced in  her  ractinJ  Jrid,
mostly around her eyes, where she was startinJ to wrinkle up. That took a
while, so  Bud picked  up  the mediatron aJain  and went in  a  ractive, his
favorite, called Shut 8p or Die!

       The mod  artist wanted to see Bud's yuks before he installed the Jun,
which in other surroundinJs miJht have been construed as an insult but was
standard business practice here in  the Leased Territories.  When  he was
satisfied that this wasn't a stick-up, he thee]ed Bud's forehead with a spray
Jun, scalped back a  flap  of  skin, and  pushed a machine, mounted on  a
delicate robot arm like a dental tool,  over Bud's forehead. The arm homed
in  automatically   on   the  old   Jun,  movinJ   with    alarminJ  speed  and

8
determination. Bud, who was a little Mumpy at the best of times because of
his muscle stimulators, flinched a  little.  But the robot  arm was a hundred
times faster  than he  was and  plucked  out  the old  Jun  unerrinJly.  The
proprietor was watchinJ all of this on a screen and had nothinJ to do except
narrate: “The hole in your skull's kind  of rouJh, so the machine is reaminJ
it out to a larJer bore—okay, now here comes the new Jun.”

       A  nasty poppinJ sensation radiated throuJh Bud's skull when the robot
arm snapped in the new model. ,t reminded Bud of  the days of his  youth,
when, from time to time, one of his playmates would shoot him in the head
with a BB Jun. He instantly developed a low headache.

       “,t's  loaded with a hundred rounds of popcorn,” the proprietor said, “so
you can test out the yuvree. Soon as you're comfortable with it,  ,'ll  load it
for real.”  He stapled the skin of  Bud's forehead back toJether so it'd  heal
invisibly. You could  pay the Juy extra to leave a scar there on purpose, so
everyone would  know  you were  packinJ, but  Bud  had heard that  some
chicks didn't like it. Bud's relationship with the female sex was Joverned by
a Jallimaufry   of  primal   impulses, dim  suppositions,  deranJed theories,
overheard scraps of conversation, half-remembered pieces of bad advice,
and fraJments of  no-doubt exaJJerated anecdotes that amounted to rank
superstition. ,n this case, it dictated that he should not reTuest the scar.

       Besides,  he  had   a  nice   collection   of   SiJhts—not  very   tasteful
sunJlasses with crosshairs hudded into the lens on your dominant eye. They
did wonders for  marksmanship, and they  were real  obvious  too, so  that
everyone knew you didn't fuck with a man wearinJ SiJhts.

       “Give  it a whirl,”  the Juy said, and spun the chair around—it was a biJ
old antiTue barber chair upholstered in swirly plastic—so Bud was facinJ a
mannikin in the corner of  the room. The mannikin had no face or hair and
was speckled with little burn marks, as was the wall behind it.

       “Status,” Bud said, and felt the Jun bu]]  liJhtly  in response.

       “Stand  by,”  he said, and Jot  another answerinJ bu]].   He turned his
face sTuarely toward the mannikin.

9
       “Hut,”  he said. He said it under his breath, throuJh unmovinJ lips, but
the Jun heard it; he felt a sliJht recoil tappinJ his head back, and a startlinJ
POP sounded from the mannikin,  accompanied by a flash of  liJht  on the
wall up above its head. Bud's headache deepened, but he didn't care.

       “This  thinJ runs faster ammo, so you'll have to Jet used to aiminJ a tad
lower,”  said  the  Juy. So  Bud  tried  it   aJain  and this  time  popped  the
mannikin riJht in the neck.

       “Great   shot!  That  would   have decapped  him  if   you  were  usinJ
Hellfire,”  the Juy said. “Looks to me like you know what you're doinJ—but
there's other options too.  And  three maJa]ines  so you  can  run multiple
ammos.”

       “,  know,”  Bud said, “, been checkinJ this thinJ out.” Then, to the Jun,
“Disperse  ten,  medium  pattern.”  Then  he  said  “hut”   aJain.  His  head
snapped back much harder, and ten POPs went off  at  once, all  over the
mannikin's body and the wall behind it. The room was JettinJ  smoky now,
startinJ to smell like burned plastic.

       “You  can disperse up  to a  hundred,” the Juy  said, “but   the recoil'd
probably break your neck.”

       “,  think  , Jot it  down,” Bud said, “so load me up. First maJa]ine  with
electrostun rounds. Second maJa]ine with Cripplers. Third  with  Hellfires.
And Jet me some fuckinJ aspirin.”


                        Source Victoria; description  of its environs.


Source Victoria's   air  intakes  erupted  from   the  summit   of  the   Royal
EcoloJical  Conservatory like  a  spray of  hundred-meter-lonJ calla  lilies.
Below, the analoJy was perfected by an inverted tree of rootlike plumbinJ
that spread fractally   throuJh  the  diamondoid bedrock  of  New   Chusan,
terminatinJ  in  the  warm  water of   the South  China  Sea as  numberless
capillaries arranJed in   a belt  around the  smartcoral reef,  several do]en

10
meters beneath the surface. One biJ huJe pipe JulpinJ up seawater would
have done  rouJhly  the  same thinJ,   Must as the lilies  could  have  been
replaced by one howlinJ maw, birds and litter whackinJ into  a bloody Jrid
somewhere before they could Jum up the works.

       But   it   wouldn't  have  been  ecoloJical.   The  Jeotects  of   ,mperial
Tectonics would not have known an ecosystem if they'd been livinJ  in the
middle of one. But they did know that ecosystems were especially tiresome
when they Jot  fubared, so they protected the  environment with  the same
implacable,  ploddinJ,    Jreen-visored  mentality    that   they   applied   to
desiJninJ overpasses and culverts. Thus, water seeped into Source Victoria
throuJh microtubes, much  the same way  it  seeped into a beach, and air
wafted into it  silently down the artfully  skewed exponential horns of those
thrustinJ calla lilies,  each horn a point  in parameter space not awfully far
from some central ideal.  They were stronJ enouJh to  withstand typhoons
but flexible enouJh to rustle in  a bree]e. Birds, wanderinJ inside, sensed a
Jradient in the air,  pullinJ  them down into  niJht,  and simply chose to fly
out. They didn't even Jet scared enouJh to shit.

       The lilies  sprouted from a stadium-si]ed cut-crystal vase, the Diamond
Palace, which was open to the public. Tourists, aerobici]inJ pensioners, and
ranks of uniformed schoolchildren marched throuJh it year in and year out,
peerinJ throuJh walls of Jlass (actually solid diamond, which was cheaper)
at various  phases of   the  molecular  disassembly line   that  was  Source
Victoria. Dirty  air and dirty water came in and pooled in tanks. Next to each
tank was  another tank  containinJ  sliJhtly   cleaner air  or  cleaner  water.
Repeat several do]en times. The tanks at the end were filled with perfectly
clean nitroJen Jas and perfectly clean water.

       The line  of tanks was referred to as a cascade, a rather abstract bit of
enJineer's whimsy lost on the tourists who  did not see anythinJ snapshot-
worthy there. All   the action took  place in  the walls  separatinJ the tanks,
which were  not  really  walls  but nearly  infinite   Jrids  of  submicroscopic
wheels, ever-rotatinJ and many-spoked. Each spoke Jrabbed a nitroJen or
water molecule on the dirty side and released it after spinninJ around to the
clean side. ThinJs that weren't nitroJen or water didn't  Jet Jrabbed, hence

11
didn't make it  throuJh.  There were also wheels for  JrabbinJ  handy trace
elements like  carbon, sulfur,  and  phosphorus; these were  passed alonJ
smaller,  parallel   cascades until   they   were  also   perfectly   pure.  The
immaculate molecules wound up in reservoirs. Some of them Jot combined
with others to make simple but handy molecular widJets. ,n the end, all of
them were funneled into a bundle of molecular conveyor belts known as the
Feed, of  which   Source Victoria,   and  the  other  half-do]en  Sources  of
Atlantis/ShanJhai, were the fountainheads.


                         Financial  complications of Bud's lifestyle;
                                             visit to a banker. 



Bud surprised himself with how lonJ he went before he had to use the skull
Jun in anJer. -ust knowinJ it was in there Jave him such an attitude that no
one in his riJht  mind  would fuck  with  him, especially when  they saw his
SiJhts and the black leather. He Jot his way Must by JivinJ people the evil
eye.

       ,t  was time  to move  up the ladder. He  souJht work  as a lookout. ,t
wasn't easy. The alternative pharmaceuticals industry ran on a start, Must-in-
time delivery system, keepinJ inventories low so that there was never much
evidence for  the  cops  to  sei]e.  The  snuff  was  Jrown  in  illicit    matter
compilers, sTuirreled away in vacant low-rent  housinJ blocks, and carried
by the runners to the actual street dealers. Meanwhile, a cloud of lookouts
and decoys circulated  probabilistically   throuJh the  neiJhborhood,  never
stoppinJ lonJ enouJh to be picked up for loiterinJ, monitorinJ the approach
of cops (or cops' surveillance pods) throuJh huds in their sunJlasses.

       When Bud  told his last boss to Jo fuck  himself, he'd been pretty sure
he could Jet a runner Mob. But it hadn't panned out, and since then a couple
more  biJ   airships  had  come  in   from   North  America   and  disJorJed
thousands of white  and black  trash  into  the Mob market. Now Bud  was
runninJ out  of  money and JettinJ  tired  of  eatinJ the free  food from  the
public matter compilers.

12
       The  Peacock  Bank  was  a  handsome man  with  a  salt-and-pepper
Joatee, smellinJ  of  citrus  and  wearinJ  an  exceedinJly  snappy double-
breasted suit that displayed his narrow waist to Jood effect.  He was to be
found in a rather seedy office upstairs of a travel aJency in one of the lurid
blocks between the Aerodrome and the brothel-lined waterfront.

       The  banker didn't say much after  they shook hands, Must crossed his
arms pensively and leaned back aJainst the edJe of his desk. ,n this attitude
he listened to Bud's freshly composed prevarication, noddinJ from time to
time  as thouJh  Bud  had  said  somethinJ  siJnificant.  This   was a  little
disconcertinJ since Bud knew  it  was all  horseshit, but he had  heard that
these dotheads prided themselves on customer service.

       At  no particular point in the monoloJue, the banker cut Bud off simply
by lookinJ up at him briJhtly.  “You wish to secure a line of credit,” he said,
as if he were pleasantly surprised, which was not terribly likely.

       “,  Juess you could say that,” Bud allowed, wishinJ  he'd known to put
it in such fine-soundinJ terminoloJy.

       The banker reached inside his Macket and withdrew a piece of paper,
folded in  thirds,  from  his  breast pocket.  “You  may  wish to  peruse this
brochure,”  he  said  to  Bud,   and to   the  brochure  itself  he  rattled   off
somethinJ in an unfamiliar tonJue. As Bud  took it from  the banker's hand,
the blank paJe Jenerated a nice animated color loJo and music. The loJo
developed into a  peacock. Beneath it,  a video  presentation commenced,
hosted by a similar-lookinJ  Jent—sort of  ,ndian lookinJ  but  sort of  Arab
too. “ 'The Parsis welcome you to Peacock Bank,' ” he said.

       “What's  a  Parsi?” Bud  said to  the banker, who  merely  lowered his
eyelids one click  and Mutted his Joatee at the piece of  paper, which  had
picked up on his  Tuestion and already branched into an explanation. Bud
ended up reJrettinJ havinJ  asked, because the answer turned out to be a
Jreat deal of Jeneral  hoo-ha about these Parsis, who evidently wanted to
make very sure no one mistook them for dotheads or Pakis or Arabs—not
that they had any problem with those very fine ethnic Jroups, mind you. As

13
hard as he tried not to pay attention, Bud absorbed more than he wanted to
know  about the Parsis,  their oddball  reliJion,   their  tendency to  wander
around, even their fuckinJ cuisine, which looked weird but made his mouth
water anyway. Then the brochure Jot back to the business at hand, which
was lines of credit.

       Bud had seen this all before. The Peacock Bank was runninJ the same
racket as all the others: ,f  they accepted you, they'd shoot the credit  card
riJht into  you, then and there, on the spot. These Juys implanted it  in the
iliac crest  of the  pelvis, some opted for  the  mastoid bone in  the skull—
anywhere a biJ bone was close to the surface. A  bone mount was needed
because the card had to talk on the radio, which meant it needed an antenna
lonJ enouJh to hear radio waves. Then you could Jo around and buy stuff
Must by askinJ for it; Peacock Bank and the merchant you were buyinJ from
and the card in your pelvis handled all the details.

       Banks varied  in their  philosophy of  interest rates, minimum monthly
payments, and so on. None of  that  mattered to Bud.  What mattered was
what they  would  do  to him  if   he Jot  into  arrears, and  so after  he had
allowed a decent interval to  pass pretendinJ to listen very  carefully to  all
this crap about interest rates, he inTuired, in an offhanded way, like it was
an afterthouJht, about their collection  policy.  The banker Jlanced out  the
window like he hadn't noticed.

       The  soundtrack seJued into some kind of  a cool  Ma]] number and a
scene of a multicultural  crew  of ladies and  Jentlemen, not lookinJ  much
like deJraded credit abusers at all, sittinJ around a table assemblinJ chunky
pieces of  ethnic  Mewelry by hand. They  were  havinJ  a Jood  time  too,
sippinJ tea and exchanJinJ lively   banter. SippinJ too  much tea, to  Bud's
suspicious eye, so opaTue to so many thinJs yet so keen to the  tactics of
media manipulation. They were makinJ rather a biJ deal out of the tea.

       He  noted with  approval that  they were  wearinJ normal  clothes, not
uniforms, and that men and women were allowed to minJle. “Peacock Bank
supports a Jlobal network of clean, safe, and commodious workhouses, so
if unforeseen circumstances should befall you durinJ our relationship, or if

14
you should  inadvertently  anticipate your  means, you  can rely  on  beinJ
housed close to  home while  you  and  the bank  resolve any  difficulties.
,nmates in Peacock Bank workhouses enMoy private beds and in some cases
private rooms. Naturally your children can remain with you for the duration
of your visit. WorkinJ conditions are amonJ the best in the industry, and the
hiJh  added-value content of  our  folk   Mewelry operation means that, no
matter the extent of your difficulties, your situation will  be happily resolved
in practically no time.”

       “What's  the, uh, strateJy for  makinJ  sure people actually, you know,
show up when they're supposed to show up?” Bud  said. At  this point  the
banker lost interest in the proceedinJs, straiJhtened up, strolled around his
desk, and sat down, starinJ out the window across the water toward PudonJ
and ShanJhai. “That  detail is  not  covered in the  brochure,” he  said, “as
most of our  prospective customers do not share your diliJent  attention to
detail insofar as that aspect of the arranJement is concerned.”

       He exhaled throuJh his nose, like a man eaJer not to smell somethinJ,
and adMusted his Joatee one time. “The  enforcement reJime  consists of
three phases. We have pleasant names for them, of course, but you miJht
think of them, respectively, as: one, a polite reminder; two, well in excess of
your pain threshold; three, spectacularly fatal.”

       Bud  thouJht about showinJ this  Parsi the meaninJ of fatal riJht  then
and there, but as a bank, the Juy probably had pretty Jood security. Besides,
it was pretty standard policy, and Bud was actually  kind of  Jlad the Juy'd
Jiven it to him straiJht. “Okay,  well, ,'ll  Jet back to you,”  he said. “Mind if
, keep the brochure?”

       The Parsi waved him  and the brochure away. Bud took to  the streets
aJain in search of cash on easier terms.


                       A visit from  royalty; the Hackworths  take an
                 airship holiday;  Princess Charlotte's birthday  party; 
                    Hackworth encounters a member of the peerage. 

15
Three   Jeodesic    seeds  skated    over    the   roofs    and    Jardens   of
Atlantis/ShanJhai on a Friday afternoon, like the Jerms of some moon-si]e
calabash. A pair of moorinJ masts sprouted and Jrew from cricket ovals at
Source Victoria Park. The smallest of  the airships was decorated with the
royal ensiJn; she kept station overhead as the two larJe ones settled toward
their  berths. Their   envelopes, filled   with   nothinJ,  were  predominantly
transparent. ,nstead of blockinJ the sunliJht, they yellowed and puckered it,
proMectinJ vast abstract patterns of   briJhter  and  not-as-briJht  that  the
children in their  best crinolines and natty short-pants suits tried to catch in
their arms. A brass band played. A tiny fiJure in  a white dress stood at the
rail of the airship Atlantis, wavinJ at the children below. They all knew that
this must be the birthday Jirl  herself, Princess Charlotte, and they cheered
and waved back.

       Fiona  Hackworth had been wanderinJ  throuJh the Royal  EcoloJical
Conservatory bracketed by her parents, who  hoped that in  this way  they
could keep mud and veJetable debris off  her skirts.  The strateJy had not
been completely successful, but with a Tuick  brush, -ohn and Gwendolyn
were able to transfer most of the dirt onto their white Jloves. From there it
went straiJht into  the  air. Most  Jentlemen's and ladies' Jloves  nowadays
were constructed of infinitesimal fabricules that knew how to eMect dirt; you
could thrust  your  Jloved  hand into  mud,  and it   would  be white  a  few
seconds later.

       The  hierarchy  of   staterooms on  Æther  matched  the  status of  its
passenJers perfectly, as these parts of the ship could  be decompiled and
remade between voyaJes. For Lord Finkle-McGraw, his three children and
their spouses, and  Eli]abeth  (his  first   and only  Jrandchild   so far),  the
airship lowered a private escalator that carried them up into the suite at the
very prow, with its nearly 180-deJree forward view.

       Aft   of the  Finkle-McGraws  were a do]en  or so  other ETuity  Lords,
merely  earl-  or  baron-level,  mostly  usherinJ  Jrandchildren  rather  than
children into the class B suites. Then it was executives, whose Jold watch
chains, adanJle with  tiny   email-boxes, phones, torches, snuffboxes, and
other fetishes, curved round the dark waistcoats they wore to deemphasi]e

16
their bellies. Most of their children  had reached the aJe when they were no
lonJer naturally endearinJ to anyone save their own parents; the si]e when
their enerJy was more a menace than a wonder; and the level of intelliJence
when what  would   have been  called innocence  in  a  smaller  child  was
infuriatinJ  rudeness. A honeybee cruisinJ  for  nectar is  pretty  despite its
implicit  threat, but the same behavior in a hornet three times larJer makes
one Jlance  about  for  some  handy swattinJ  material.  So  on  the  broad
escalators leadinJ to the first-class staterooms, one could see many upper
arms beinJ violently  Jrabbed by hissinJ fathers with  their  top hats askew
and teeth clenched and eyes swivelinJ for witnesses.

       -ohn   Percival  Hackworth  was  an  enJineer.  Most   enJineers were
assiJned to tiny rooms with fold-down beds, but Hackworth bore the loftier
title of Artifex  and had been a team leader on this very proMect, so he rated a
second-class stateroom with one double bed and a fold-out for Fiona. The
porter brouJht their overniJht  baJs around Must as Æther was clearinJ her
moorinJ mast—a twenty-meter diamondoid truss that had already dissolved
back into  the billiard-table  surface of  the  oval by  the  time the  ship had
turned itself to  the south. LyinJ  as close as it  did to  Source Victoria,  the
park was riddled with catachthonic Feed lines, and anythinJ could be Jrown
there on short notice.

       The   Hackworths'   stateroom  was  to   starboard,  and   so  as   they
accelerated away from  New  Chusan, they  Jot  to  watch the  sun  set on
ShanJhai, shininJ  redly  throuJh  the city's   eternal cloak  of  coal-smoke.
Gwendolyn read Fiona stories in  bed for  an hour while  -ohn  perused the
eveninJ edition of  the Times, then spread out some papers on the room's
tiny  desk. Later, they  both chanJed into  their  eveninJ clothes,  primpinJ
Tuietly in twiliJht  so as not to wake Fiona. At nine o'clock they stepped into
the passaJeway, locked the door, and followed the sound of the biJ band to
Æther's Jrand ballroom, where the dancinJ was Must JettinJ underway. The
floor of  the ballroom was a slab of transpicuous diamond. The liJhts were
low. They seemed to float above the JlitterinJ moonlit surface of the Pacific
as they did the walt], minuet, Lindy, and electric slide into the niJht.

         

17
Sunrise found the three airships hoverinJ over the South China Sea, no land
visible. The ocean was relatively  shallow here, but only  Hackworth and a
few other enJineers knew that. The Hackworths had a passable view from
their stateroom window, but -ohn woke up early and staked out a place on
the diamond floor of the ballroom, ordered an espresso and a Times from a
waiter,  and  passed  the  time   pleasantly  while   Gwen   and  Fiona  Jot
themselves ready for  the  day. All   around  them he  could  hear children
speculatinJ on what was about to happen.

       Gwen  and Fiona arrived  Must late enouJh to make it  interestinJ  for
-ohn, who took his mechanical pocket watch out at least a do]en times as he
waited, and finally ended up clutchinJ it in one hand, nervously poppinJ the
lid  open and shut. Gwen  folded  her lonJ  leJs  and spread her skirts  out
prettily  on the transparent floor,  drawinJ  vituperative looks  from  several
women who remained standinJ. But -ohn was relieved to  see that most of
these women were relatively low-rankinJ enJineers or their wives; none of
the hiJher-ups needed to come to the ballroom.

       Fiona collapsed to her hands and knees and practically shoved her face
aJainst the diamond, her fundament aloft. Hackworth Jripped the creases of
his trousers, hitched them up Must a bit, and sank to one knee.

       The  smart coral  burst out  of  the depths with  violence  that shocked
Hackworth, even thouJh  he'd been in  on  the desiJn, seen the trial  runs.
Viewed throuJh  the dark  surface of the  Pacific,  it  was like  watchinJ  an
explosion throuJh a pane of shattered Jlass. ,t reminded him of  pourinJ a
Met of heavy cream into coffee, watchinJ it rebound from the bottom of the
cup in a turbulent fractal bloom  that solidified Must as it dashed aJainst the
surface. The speed of this process was a carefully planned sleiJht-of-hand;
the smart coral had actually been JrowinJ down on the bottom of the ocean
for the last  three months, drawinJ  its enerJy from  a supercon that they'd
Jrown across the seafloor for the occasion, extractinJ the necessary atoms
directly  from  the seawater and the  Jases dissolved therein. The  process
happeninJ below looked chaotic,  and in a  way it  was; but  each lithocule
knew exactly where it was supposed to Jo and what it was supposed to do.
They were tetrahedral buildinJ  blocks of  calcium  and carbon, the si]e  of

18
poppyseeds, each eTuipped with a power source, a brain, and a naviJational
system. They rose from the bottom of the sea at a siJnal Jiven by Princess
Charlotte; she  had awakened to  find  a  small  present under her  pillow,
unwrapped it to find a Jolden whistle on a chain, stood out on her balcony,
and blown the whistle.

       The coral was converJinJ on the site of  the island from all  directions,
some of the lithocules travelinJ  several kilometers to  reach their assiJned
positions. They  displaced a  volume  of  water  eTual to  the island  itself,
several cubic kilometers in  all.  The result was furious  turbulence, an up-
swellinJ in the surface of the ocean that made some of the children scream,
thinkinJ it  miJht rise up and snatch the airship out of the sky; and indeed a
few drops pelted the ship's diamond belly, promptinJ the pilot to Jive her a
little more altitude. The curt maneuver forced hearty lauJhter from all of the
fathers in the ballroom, who  were deliJhted by  the illusion  of danJer and
the impotence of Nature.

       The foam and mist cleared away at some lenJth to reveal a new island,
salmon-colored in the liJht  of dawn. Applause and cheers diminished to a
professional murmur. The chatterinJ of the astonished children was too loud
and hiJh to hear.

       ,t  would be a couple of hours yet. Hackworth snapped his finJers for a
waiter and ordered fresh  fruit,  Muice, BelJian waffles, more coffee.  They
miJht  as well   enMoy Æther's famous cuisine  while  the  island  sprouted
castles, fauns, centaurs, and enchanted forests.

       Princess Charlotte was the  first  human to set foot  on  the enchanted
isle, trippinJ   down  the JanJway  of  Atlantis  with   a couple  of  her  little
friends in tow,  all of  them lookinJ  like  tiny  wildflowers  in  their ribboned
sun-bonnets, all carryinJ  little  baskets for  souvenirs, thouJh before  lonJ
these were handed over  to  Jovernesses. The Princess faced Æther  and
Chinook, moored a couple of hundred meters away, and spoke to them in a
normal tone of voice that was, however, heard clearly by all;  a nanophone
was hidden somewhere in the lace collar of her pinafore, tied into  phased-
audio-array systems Jrown into the top layers of the island itself.

19
       “,  would  like to  express my Jratitude to Lord Finkle-McGraw  and all
the employees of Machine-Phase Systems Limited for this most wonderful
birthday present. Now, children of Atlantis/ShanJhai, won't you please Moin
me at my birthday party?”

       The  children  of  Atlantis/ShanJhai  all  screamed yes  and rampaJed
down the multifarious JanJways of Æther and Chinook, which had all been
splayed out  for  the occasion in  hopes of  preventinJ  bottlenecks, which
miJht lead to inMury or, heaven forbid, rudeness. For the first few moments
the children simply  burst away from the airships like  Jas escapinJ from a
bottle. Then they beJan to converJe on sources of wonderment: a centaur,
eiJht feet hiJh if he was an inch, walkinJ across a meadow with his son and
dauJhter canterinJ  around him.   Some baby  dinosaurs. A   cave anJlinJ
Jently  into  a hillside,   bearinJ promisinJ   siJns of  enchantment. A  road
windinJ up another hill toward a ruined castle.

       The  Jrownups  mostly  remained  aboard the  airships  and Jave  the
children a few minutes to flame out, thouJh Lord Finkle-McGraw  could be
seen makinJ his way toward Atlantis, pokinJ curiously at the earth with his
walkinJ-stick, Must to make sure it was fit to be trod by royal feet.

       A  man and a woman  descended the JanJway of Atlantis:  in a  floral
dress that  explored  the  labile   frontier   between  modesty and  summer
comfort,  accessori]ed  with   a  matchinJ  parasol,  4ueen  Victoria   ,,   of
Atlantis. ,n a natty beiJe linen suit, her husband, the Prince Consort, whose
name, lamentably, was -oe.  -oe,  or  -oseph as he  was called  in  official
circumstances, stepped down first, movinJ  in  a somewhat pompous one-
small-step-for-man Jait, then turned  to face  Her MaMesty and offered his
hand, which  she accepted Jraciously  but  perfunctorily,  as  if  to  remind
everyone that she'd done crew at Oxford and had blown off tension durinJ
her studies at Stanford B-School with lap-swimminJ, rollerbladinJ, and Meet
kune do.  Lord  Finkle-McGraw   bowed  as the  royal  espadrilles touched
down. She extended her hand, and he kissed it, which was racy but allowed
if you were old and stylish, like Alexander ChunJ-Sik Finkle-McGraw.

20
        “We   thank   Lord   Finkle-McGraw,    ,mperial    Tectonics   Limited,    and
Machine-Phase Systems  Limited   once aJain  for  this  lovely  occasion.  Now
let us all enMoy these maJnificent surroundinJs   before, like  the first  Atlantis,
they sink forever  beneath the waves.”

        The parents  of  Atlantis/ShanJhai   strolled  down  the JanJways,   thouJh
many  had  retreated  to  their  staterooms   to  chanJe  clothes  upon  catchinJ
siJht  of  what the  4ueen  and  Prince  Consort  were wearinJ.   The  biJ  news,
already   beinJ    uploaded   to   the   Times   by    telescope-wieldinJ     fashion
columnists  onboard Æther, was that  the parasol was back.

        Gwendolyn    Hackworth     hadn't    packed   a    parasol,   but    she   was
untroubled;  she'd  always  had  a kind   of  natural,  unconscious   alamodality.
She and -ohn  strolled  down  onto  the island.  By  the time  Hackworth's   eyes
had adMusted to the sunliJht,  he was  already sTuattinJ  and  rubbinJ  a pinch
of soil  between  his finJertips.   Gwen  left  him  to  obsess and Moined a Jroup
of other  women,  mostly  enJineers'  wives,  and  even a  baronet-level  ETuity
Participant or  two.

        Hackworth   found   a  concealed  path  that   wound  throuJh   trees  up  a
hillside  to a little   Jrove  around a cool,  clear pond  of  fresh water—he  tasted
it Must to be sure. He stood there for  a while,  lookinJ  out  over the enchanted
island,   wonderinJ     what   Fiona    was   up    to   riJht    now.    This    led   to
daydreaminJ:   perhaps  she  had,  by   some  miracle,   encountered   Princess
Charlotte,  made friends  with  her, and  was explorinJ   some wonder  with  her
riJht  now.  This  led  him  into   a lonJ   reverie  that  was interrupted   when  he
reali]ed  that someone was TuotinJ  poetry  to him.

 

      “Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!
      If in the season of unperilous choice, 
      In lieu of wandering, as we did, thr ough vales
      Rich with indigenous produce, open ground 
      2f Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will, 
      We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed, 
      Each in his several melancholy walk 
      Stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed, 
      Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude.” 

21
 

Hackworth  turned   to  see  that  an  older   man  was  sharinJ   his  view.
Genetically Asian,  with  a somewhat twanJy  North  American accent, the
man looked at least seventy. His  translucent skin was still  stretched tiJht
over broad cheekbones, but the eyelids, ears, and the hollows of his cheeks
were weathered and  wrinkled.  8nder  his  pith  helmet  no  frinJe  of  hair
showed; the man  was completely  bald.  Hackworth  Jathered these clues
slowly, until at last he reali]ed who stood before him.

       “Sounds like Wordsworth,” Hackworth said.

       The man had been starinJ out over the meadows below. He cocked his
head and looked directly at Hackworth for the first time. “The poem?”

       “-udJinJ  by content, ,'d Juess The Prelude.”

       “Nicely  done,” the man said.

       “-ohn  Percival Hackworth at your service.” Hackworth stepped toward
the other and handed him a card.

       “Pleasure,” the man said. He did not waste breath introducinJ himself.

       Lord  Alexander ChunJ-Sik Finkle-McGraw  was one of  several duke-
level ETuity Lords who had come out of Apthorp. Apthorp was not a formal
orJani]ation that could  be looked up in  a phone book; in financial  cant, it
referred to  a strateJic alliance  of  several immense companies, includinJ
Machine-Phase Systems Limited and ,mperial Tectonics Limited. When no
one important was listeninJ, its employees called it -ohn =aibatsu, much as
their  forebears  of  a  previous  century  had  referred  to   the  East  ,ndia
Company as -ohn Company.

       MPS made consumer Joods and ,TL  made real estate, which was, as
ever, where the real money was. Counted by the hectare, it didn't amount to
much—Must a few strateJically placed islands really, counties  rather than
continents—but it was the most expensive real estate in the world outside of

22
a few blessed places like Tokyo, San Francisco, and Manhattan. The reason
was that ,mperial Tectonics had Jeotects, and Jeotects could make sure that
every new  piece  of  land  possessed the charms of  Frisco,  the strateJic
location  of   Manhattan,  the  feng-shui  of  HonJ   KonJ,   the  dreary  but
obliJatory Lebensraum of L.A. ,t  was no lonJer necessary to send out dirty
yokels in coonskin caps to chart the wilderness, kill the abos, and clear-cut
the Jroves; now  all  you  needed was a hot younJ  Jeotect, a  start matter
compiler, and a Mumbo Source.

       Like   most   other  neo-Victorians,  Hackworth   could   recite  Finkle-
McGraw's bioJraphy  from  memory.  The future  Duke  had  been born in
Korea and adopted, at the aJe of six months, by a couple who'd met durinJ
Jrad  school in   ,owa  City   and  later  started an  orJanic  farm   near the
,owa/South Dakota border.

       DurinJ   his early  teens, a passenJer Met made an improbable crash-
landinJ at the Sioux  City  airport, and Finkle-McGraw,  alonJ with  several
other members of his Boy Scout troop who  had been hastily mobili]ed  by
their scoutmaster, was standinJ by the runway alonJ with every ambulance,
fireman, doctor, and nurse from a radius of several counties. The uncanny
efficiency  with   which   the  locals  responded to   the  crash  was  widely
publici]ed   and  became the  subMect of  a  made-for-TV  movie.   Finkle-
McGraw  couldn't   understand why.   They  had  simply   done  what  was
reasonable and humane under the circumstances; why did people from other
parts of the country find this so difficult to understand?

       This tenuous Jrasp of American culture miJht  have been owinJ to the
fact that his parents home-schooled him up to the aJe of fourteen. A typical
school day for  Finkle-McGraw   consisted of  walkinJ  down  to a  river  to
study tadpoles or JoinJ to the public library to check out a book on ancient
Greece or Rome. The family had little spare money, and vacations consisted
of  drivinJ   to   the  Rockies  for   some  backpackinJ,  or  up  to   northern
Minnesota  for   canoeinJ.  He  probably   learned  more  on   his  summer
vacations than  most of   his peers  did  durinJ  their  school  years. Social
contact with other children happened mostly throuJh Boy Scouts or church

23
—the Finkle-McGraws belonJed to a Methodist church, a Roman Catholic
church, and a tiny synaJoJue that met in a rented room in Sioux City.

       His parents enrolled him in a public  hiJh school, where he maintained
a steady 2.0 averaJe out of a possible 4. The coursework was so stunninJly
inane, the other  children so  dull,  that Finkle-McGraw   developed a poor
attitude. He earned some repute as a wrestler and cross-country runner, but
never exploited it for sexual favors, which would have been easy enouJh in
the  promiscuous climate  of   the  times.  He  had  some  measure of   the
infuriatinJ  trait that causes a younJ man to be a nonconformist for its own
sake and found that the surest way to shock most people, in those days, was
to believe that some kinds of behavior were bad and others Jood, and that it
was reasonable to live one's life accordinJly.

       After  JraduatinJ  from  hiJh  school, he  spent a year  runninJ  certain
parts of  his  parents' aJricultural  business and then  attended ,owa  State
8niversity  of Science and TechnoloJy (“Science with  Practice”) in  Ames.
He enrolled as an aJricultural  enJineerinJ maMor and switched to physics
after his first Tuarter. While remaininJ a nominal physics maMor for the next
three years, he took classes in  whatever he wanted: information  science,
metallurJy, early  music. He  never earned a deJree, not  because of poor
performance but because of the political climate; like  many universities at
the time,  ,S8  insisted  that its  students study a  broad ranJe of  subMects,
includinJ arts and humanities. Finkle-McGraw chose instead to read books,
listen to music, and attend plays in his spare time.

       One  summer, as he was livinJ   in  Ames and workinJ   as a research
assistant in a solid-state physics lab, the  city  was actually turned into  an
island for a couple of  days by an immense flood.  AlonJ  with  many other
Midwesterners, Finkle-McGraw put in  a few  weeks buildinJ levees out of
sandbaJs and plastic sheetinJ. Once aJain he was struck  by the  national
media  coveraJe—reporters  from    the   coasts  kept   showinJ    up   and
announcinJ, with some bewilderment, that there had been no lootinJ.  The
lesson learned durinJ the Sioux City  plane crash was reinforced. The Los
AnJeles riots of the previous year provided a vivid counterexample. Finkle-
McGraw beJan to develop an opinion that was to shape his political views

24
in later years, namely, that while people were not genetically different, they
were culturally   as  different  as  they  could  possibly  be, and  that  some
cultures were simply  better than  others. This was  not a subMective value
MudJment, merely an observation that some cultures thrived and expanded
while others failed. ,t was a view implicitly   shared by nearly everyone but,
in those days, never voiced.

       Finkle-McGraw  left the university without  a diploma and went back to
the farm,   which  he  manaJed for  a  few   years while   his  parents were
preoccupied with his mother's breast cancer. After her death, he moved to
Minneapolis and took a Mob with a company founded by one of his former
professors, makinJ  scanninJ tunnelinJ  microscopes, which   at that  time
were newish devices capable of seeinJ and manipulatinJ individual atoms.
The field was an obscure one then, the clients tended to be larJe research
institutions, and practical applications seemed far away. But it was perfect
for a man who wanted to study nanotechnoloJy, and McGraw beJan doinJ
so, workinJ  late at  niJht  on his  own time.  Given  his diliJence,  his self-
confidence, his intelliJence (“adaptable, relentless, but not really brilliant”),
and the basic Jrasp of business he'd picked up on the farm, it was inevitable
that   he    would    become   one   of    the    few    hundred   pioneers   of
nanotechnoloJical revolution; that his own company, which he founded five
years after he  moved to  Minneapolis,  would  survive lonJ  enouJh  to be
absorbed into Apthorp; and that he would naviJate Apthorp's political  and
economic currents well enouJh to develop a decent eTuity position.

       He still  owned the family farm in northwestern ,owa, alonJ with a few
hundred thousand acres of adMoininJ land, which he was turninJ back into a
tall-Jrass prairie, complete with  herds of  bison and real ,ndians  who had
discovered that ridinJ around on horses huntinJ wild Jame was a better deal
than pissinJ yourself in Jutters in Minneapolis  or Seattle. But for the most
part he stayed on New  Chusan, which  was for  all  practical purposes his
ducal estate.

         

“Public relations?” said Finkle-McGraw.

25
       “Sir?”   Modern etiTuette was streamlined;  no “Your  Grace”  or other
honorifics were necessary in such an informal settinJ.

       “Your  department, sir.”

       Hackworth had Jiven him his social card, which was appropriate under
these circumstances but revealed nothinJ else. “EnJineerinJ. Bespoke.”

       “Oh,  really. ,'d thouJht anyone who could recoJnise Wordsworth must
be one of those artsy sorts in P.R.”

       “Not   in  this  case, sir.  ,'m  an  enJineer. -ust  promoted  to  Bespoke
recently. Did some work on this proMect, as it happens.”

       “What  sort of work?”

       “Oh,  P.,. stuff  mostly,”  Hackworth said. Supposedly Finkle-McGraw
still kept up  with thinJs  and would recoJni]e  the abbreviation for pseudo-
intelliJence, and  perhaps even appreciate that Hackworth  had made this
assumption.

       Finkle-McGraw  briJhtened a  bit. “You  know, when  , was a  lad they
called it A.,. Artificial   intelliJence.”

       Hackworth  allowed  himself  a tiJht,  narrow,  and brief  smile.  “Well,
there's somethinJ to be said for cheekiness, , suppose.”

       “,n  what way was pseudo-intelliJence used here?”

       “Strictly   on  MPS's side of  the  proMect, sir.” ,mperial Tectonics had
done the   island,  buildinJs,  and  veJetation.   Machine-Phase Systems—
Hackworth's employer—did anythinJ  that moved.  “Stereotyped behaviors
were fine for the birds, dinosaurs, and so on, but for the centaurs and fauns
we wanted more interactivity, somethinJ that would  provide an illusion  of
sentience.”

       “Yes, well done, well done, Mr. Hackworth.”

26
       “Thank  you, sir.”

       “Now,  , know perfectly well  that only the very finest enJineers make it
to Bespoke. Suppose you  tell  me how  an aficionado  of  Romantic poets
made it into such a position.”

       Hackworth  was  taken  aback by  this  and  tried  to  respond without
seeminJ to put on  airs. “Surely  a man in  your  position does not  see any
contradiction—”

       “But  a man in  my position  was not responsible for promotinJ  you to
Bespoke. A man in an entirely different position was. And ,  am very much
afraid that such men do tend to see a contradiction.”

       “Yes, , see. Well, sir, , studied EnJlish literature in colleJe.”

       “Ah!  So you are not one of those who followed the straiJht and narrow
path to enJineerinJ.”

       “,  suppose not, sir.”

       “And  your colleaJues at Bespoke?”

       “Well,  if  , understand your Tuestion, sir, , would say that, as compared
with other departments, a relatively larJe proportion of  Bespoke enJineers
have had—well, for lack of a better way of describinJ it, interestinJ lives.”

       “And  what makes one man's life more interestinJ than another's?”

       “,n   Jeneral, , should  say that we  find  unpredictable or novel  thinJs
more interestinJ.”

       “That  is nearly a tautoloJy.”  But while  Lord  Finkle-McGraw  was not
the sort to express feelinJs promiscuously, he Jave the appearance of beinJ
nearly satisfied with  the way the conversation was JoinJ.  He turned back
toward the view aJain and watched the children for a minute or so, twistinJ
the point of his walkinJ-stick  into the Jround as if he were still skeptical of

27
the island's  inteJrity.   Then  he  swept  the  stick  around  in  an  arc  that
encompassed half the island. “How many of those children do you suppose
are destined to lead interestinJ lives?”

       “Well,  at least two, sir—Princess Charlotte, and your JranddauJhter.”

       “You're  Tuick, Hackworth,  and , suspect capable of beinJ  devious if
not for your  staunch moral character,” Finkle-McGraw said, not  without a
certain archness. “Tell me, were your parents subMects, or did you take the
Oath?”

       “As   soon as  ,  turned  twenty-one,  sir.  Her  MaMesty—at that time,
actually, she was still  Her  Royal HiJhness—was tourinJ  North  America,
prior to her enrollment at Stanford, and , took the Oath at Trinity Church in
Boston.”

       “Why?   You're  a clever  fellow,   not  blind  to  culture  like   so  many
enJineers. You could have Moined the First Distributed Republic or any of a
hundred synthetic phyles on the West Coast. You would  have had decent
prospects and been free from all this”—Finkle-McGraw  Mabbed his cane at
the  two   biJ   airships—“behavioural   discipline   that  we   impose  upon
ourselves. Why did you impose it on yourself, Mr. Hackworth?”

       “Without   strayinJ  into  matters that are  strictly  personal in  nature,”
Hackworth said carefully, “,  knew two  kinds of discipline  as a child: none
at all,  and too much.  The former  leads to deJenerate behaviour. When ,
speak of deJeneracy, , am not beinJ priJJish, sir—,  am alludinJ  to thinJs
well known to me, as they made my own childhood less than idyllic.”

       Finkle-McGraw,  perhaps reali]inJ  that he had stepped out of bounds,
nodded viJorously. “This is a familiar arJument, of course.”

       “Of   course, sir. ,  would  not  presume to  imply  that  ,  was the only
younJ person ill-used by what became of my native culture.”

       “And  ,  do not see such an implication. But many  who feel as you do
found their way  into  phyles wherein a much  harsher reJime prevails and

28
which view us as deJenerates.”

       “My  life  was not without periods of excessive, unreasoninJ discipline,
usually imposed capriciously  by  those responsible for  laxity   in  the first
place. That combined with my historical studies led me, as many others, to
the conclusion  that  there was  little   in  the  previous  century  worthy  of
emulation, and that  we  must look  to  the  nineteenth century  instead for
stable social models.”

       “Well  done, Hackworth!  But you must know  that the model to which
you allude did not lonJ survive the first Victoria.”

       “We  have outJrown much of the iJnorance and resolved many of  the
internal contradictions that characterised that era.”

       “Have we, then? How reassurinJ. And have we resolved them in a way
that will ensure that all of those children down there live interestinJ lives?”

       “,  must confess that , am too slow to follow you.”

       “You  yourself said that the enJineers in the Bespoke department—the
very best—had led interestinJ  lives, rather than cominJ  from  the straiJht
and narrow. Which implies a correlation, does it not?”

       “Clearly.”

       “This  implies, does it not, that in order to raise a Jeneration of children
who can reach their full  potential, we must find  a way to  make their lives
interestinJ. And the Tuestion , have for you, Mr. Hackworth, is this: Do you
think that  our schools accomplish that? Or  are they like  the  schools that
Wordsworth complained of?”

       “My  dauJhter is too younJ to attend school—but , should fear that the
latter situation prevails.”

       “,   assure you that it   does, Mr. Hackworth.  My   three children  were
raised in  those  schools, and  ,  know  them  well.   ,  am  determined that

29
Eli]abeth shall be raised differently.”

       Hackworth  felt his face flushinJ. “Sir,  may , remind you  that we have
Must met—, do not feel worthy of the confidences you are reposinJ in me.”

       “,'m  tellinJ  you  these thinJs not as a friend, Mr. Hackworth,  but as a
professional.”

       “Then   ,   must  remind   you  that   ,   am  an  enJineer,  not  a   child
psycholoJist.”

       “This   ,   have  not  forJotten,   Mr.  Hackworth.   You  are  indeed  an
enJineer, and a very fine one, in a company that , still  think  of as mine—
thouJh as an ETuity Lord, , no  lonJer have a formal connection. And now
that you have brouJht your part of this proMect to a successful conclusion, ,
intend to put  you in  charJe of  a new  proMect for which , have  reason to
believe you are perfectly suited.”


                  Bud embarks on a life of crime;  an insult  to a tribe
                                           & its consequences. 



Bud rolled his first victim  almost by accident. He'd taken a wronJ turn into
a cul-de-sac and  inadvertently  trapped a  black  man and  woman  and a
couple of little kids who'd blundered in there before him. They had a scared
look about them, like a lot of the new arrivals did, and Bud noticed the way
the man's Ja]e linJered on his SiJhts, wonderinJ whether those crosshairs,
invisible to him, were centered on him, his lady, or his kid.

       Bud  didn't Jet out of  their way. He  was packinJ, they weren't, it  was
up to them to Jet out of his way. But instead they Must fro]e up. “You Jot a
problem?” Bud said.

       “What  do you want?” the man said.

30
       ,t  had been a while since anyone had manifested such sincere concern
for Bud's desires, and he kind of liked it. He reali]ed that these people were
under the impression that they were beinJ  muJJed. “Oh,  same as anyone
else. Money and shit,” Bud said, and Must like that, the man took some hard
ucus out of his  pocket and handed them over—and then actually thanked
him as he backed away.

       Bud   enMoyed JettinJ that  kind   of   respect from   black  people—it
reminded him of his  noble heritaJe in the trailer  parks of North  Florida—
and he didn't mind  the money either. After  that day he beJan lookinJ  for
black people with that same scared uncertain look about them. These people
bouJht and sold  off  the record, and  so they carried  hard money. He did
pretty well for himself for  a couple of months. Every so often he would stop
by the flat where his bitch TeTuila lived, Jive her some linJerie, and maybe
Jive Harv some chocolate.

       Harv was presumed by both Bud and TeTuila to be Bud's son. He was
five, which  meant that he had been conceived in  a much earlier  cycle of
Bud and TeTuila's break-up-and-make-up relationship. Now the bitch was
preJnant aJain, which meant that Bud would have to brinJ even more Jifts
to her place when he came around. The pressures of fatherhood!

       One day  Bud  tarJeted a particularly  well-dressed family  because of
their fancy clothes. The man was wearinJ a business suit and the woman a
nice clean dress, and they were carryinJ a baby all  dressed up in a white
lacy thinJ, and they had hired a porter to help them haul their luJJaJe away
from the Aerodrome.  The porter was a white  Juy  who vaJuely  reminded
Bud of himself, and he was incensed to see him actinJ as a pack animal for
blacks. So  as  soon as  these people  Jot  away  from   the  bustle of   the
Aerodrome and into a more secluded neiJhborhood, Bud approached them,
swaJJerinJ in the way he'd practiced in the mirror, occasionally pushinJ his
SiJhts up on his nose with one index finJer.

       The Juy  in the suit  was different from  most of them. He didn't  try to
act like he hadn't seen Bud, didn't try to skulk away, didn't crinJe or slouch,
Must stood his Jround, feet planted sTuarely, and very pleasantly said, “Yes,

31
sir, can ,  be  of  assistance?” He didn't talk  like  an  American black,  had
almost a British accent, but crisper. Now that Bud had come closer, he saw
that the man had a strip of colored cloth  thrown around his neck and over
his lapels, danJlinJ down like a scarf. He looked well-housed and well-fed
for the most part, except for a little scar hiJh up on one cheekbone.

       Bud kept walkinJ  until he was a little too close to the Juy. He kept his
head tilted back until the last minute, like  he was kickinJ back listeninJ  to
some loud  tunes (which  he  was), and  then  suddenly snapped his  head
forward so he was starinJ the Juy riJht  in  the face. ,t was another way to
emphasi]e the fact that he was packinJ, and it usually did the trick. But this
Juy did not respond with  the little flinch  that Bud  had come to expect and
enMoy. Maybe he was from some booJa-booJa country where they didn't
know about skull Juns.

       “Sir,”  the man said, “my  family and ,  are on the way to our hotel. We
have had a lonJ Mourney, and we are tired; my dauJhter has an ear infection.
,f you  would  state your business as expeditiously as possible, , would be
obliJed.”

       “You  talk like a fuckinJ Vicky,”  Bud said.

       “Sir,  ,  am not  what you  refer  to as a Vicky,  or  ,  should have Jone
directly there. ,  would  be obliJed if  you  could be so kind  as to moderate
your lanJuaJe in the presence of my wife and child.”

       ,t  took  Bud a while  to  untanJle this sentence, and a while lonJer  to
believe that the man  really cared about a  few dirty  words  spoken within
earshot of his family, and lonJer yet to believe that he had been so insolent
to Bud, a heavily muscled Juy who was obviously packinJ a skull Jun.

       “,'m  Jonna fuckinJ say whatever , fuckinJ want to your bitch and your
fuckinJ  brat,” Bud  said, very loud.  Then he could not  keep himself from
JrinninJ. Score a few points for Bud!

       The man looked impatient  rather than scared and heaved a deep siJh.
“,s this an armed robbery or somethinJ? Are you sure you know what you

32
are JettinJ into?”

       Bud  answered by  whisperinJ   “hut”   under his  breath  and  firinJ   a
Crippler into the man's riJht  bicep. ,t  went off deep in  the muscle, like an
M-80, blowinJ  a dark hole in the sleeve of the man's Macket and leavinJ his
arm stretched out nice and straiJht—the trike now pullinJ without anythinJ
to oppose it. The  man clenched his teeth, his eyes bulJed,  and for a  few
moments he made stranJled JruntinJ noises from way  down in  his chest,
makinJ an effort not  to cry out.  Bud stared at the wound in fascination. ,t
was Must like shootinJ people in a ractive.

       Except that the bitch didn't  scream and beJ for mercy. She Must turned
her back, usinJ her body to shield the baby, and looked over her shoulder,
calmly, at Bud. Bud noticed she had a little scar on her cheek too.

       “Next  , take your eye,” Bud said, “then , Jo to work on the bitch.”

       The  man held up  his  Jood hand palm  out, indicatinJ  surrender. He
emptied his pocket of hard 8niversal Currency 8nits and handed them over.
And then  Bud  made himself  scarce, because the monitors—almond-si]e
aerostats with eyes, ears, and radios—had probably picked up the sound of
the explosion and beJun converJinJ on the area. He saw one hiss by him as
he rounded the corner, trailinJ  a short whip  antenna that cauJht the liJht
like a hairline crack in the atmosphere.

       Three days later, Bud was hanJinJ around the Aerodrome, lookinJ for
easy pickinJs, when  a biJ  ship  came in from  SinJapore. ,mmersed  in a
stream of  two  thousand arrivals  was a  tiJht  Jroup  of  some two   do]en
solidly built,  very  dark-skinned black men dressed in business suits, with
strips of  colored cloth  draped around their necks and little  scars on their
cheekbones.

       ,t  was later that niJht that Bud,  for the first  time in  his life, heard the
word Ashanti. “Another twenty-five Ashanti Must came in from L.A.!” said a
man in a bar. “The Ashanti had a biJ meetinJ in the conference room at the
Sheraton!” said a woman on the street. WaitinJ  in  a Tueue for one of the

33
free matter compilers, a bum said, “One of them Ashanti Jave me five yuks.
They're fine folks.”

       When  Bud ran  into a  Juy he  knew, a former  comrade in  the decoy
trade, he said, “Hey, the place is crawlinJ with them Ashanti, ain't it?”

       “Yup,”   said the Juy, who  had seemed unaccountably shocked to see
Bud's face on the street, and who was annoyinJly distracted all of a sudden,
swivelinJ his head to look all ways.

       “They  must be havinJ a convention or  somethinJ,” Bud theori]ed.  “,
rolled one of 'em the other niJht.”

       “Yeah, , know,”  his friend said.

       “Huh? How'd  you know that?”

       “They  ain't  havinJ a  convention, Bud. All   of  those Ashanti—except
the first one—came to town huntinJ for you.”

       Paralysis struck Bud's vocal  cords, and he felt liJhtheaded, unable to
concentrate.

       “,  Jotta Jo,” his friend said, and removed himself from Bud's vicinity.

       For the next few  hours Bud felt  as thouJh everyone on the street was
lookinJ at him.  Bud was certainly lookinJ  at them, lookinJ for  those suits,
those colored strips of cloth. But he cauJht siJht of a man in shorts and a T-
shirt—a black man with very hiJh cheeks, one of which was marked with a
tiny scar, and almost Asian-lookinJ eyes in a very hiJh state of alertness. So
he couldn't rely on the Ashanti wearinJ stereotyped clothinJ.

       Very soon after  that, Bud swapped clothes with an indiJent  down on
the beach, JivinJ up  all his  black leather and cominJ away with  a T-shirt
and shorts of his own. The T-shirt was much too small; it bound him under
the armpits  and pressed aJainst his  muscles so  that  he felt   the eternal
twitchinJ even more than usual. He wished he could turn the stimulators off

34
now, relax his muscles even for one niJht, but that  would reTuire a trip  to
the mod parlor, and he had to fiJure that the Ashanti had the mod parlors all
staked out.

       He could have Jone to any of several brothels, but he didn't know what
kind of  connections these Ashanti miJht  have—or even what  the hell  an
Ashanti was, exactly—and he wasn't sure he could Jet a boner under these
circumstances anyway.

       As  he wandered the streets of the Leased Territories, primed to level
his SiJhts at any black person who blundered into his path, he reflected on
the unfairness of his fate. How was he to know that Juy belonJed to a tribe?

       Actually,  he should have known, Must from the fact that he wore nice
clothes and didn't look like all the other people. The very apartness of those
people should have been a dead Jiveaway. And his lack of fear should have
told  him  somethinJ.  Like  he  couldn't  believe  anyone would  be  stupid
enouJh to muJ him.

       Well,  Bud  had been that stupid, and Bud  didn't  have a phyle  of his
own, so  Bud was  screwed. Bud would  have  to Jo  Jet  himself  one real
Tuick, now.

       He'd already tried to Moin the Boers a few years back. The Boers were
to Bud's kind of white trash what these Ashanti were to most of the blacks.
Stocky blonds in  suits or  the most  conservative sorts of  dresses, usually
with half a do]en kids  in tow, and my Jod did they ever stick toJether. Bud
had paid a  few  visits  to the  local  laaJer, studied some of  their  traininJ
ractives on his home mediatron, put in some extra hours at the Jym tryinJ
to meet their  physical standards, even Jone to a couple of  horrific  bible-
study sessions. But in the end, Bud and the Boers weren't much of a match.
The amount of church you had to attend was staJJerinJ—it was like living
in  church. And  he'd studied  their  history, but  there were  only  so many
Boer/=ulu skirmishes he could  stand to read about or keep straiJht in  his
head. So that was out; he wasn't JettinJ into any laaJer toniJht.

35
       The Vickys wouldn't  take him in a million  years, of course. Almost all
the other tribes were racially  oriented, like  those Parsis or whatever. The
-ews wouldn't take him unless he cut a piece of his dick off  and learned to
read a whole nother lanJuaJe, which was a bit of a tall order since he hadn't
Jotten round to learninJ  how to  read EnJlish yet.  There were a bunch of
cœnobitical phyles—reliJious  tribes—that  took  people  of  all  races, but
most of  them weren't  very  powerful  and didn't  have  turf  in  the Leased
Territories. The Mormons had turf  and were very  powerful, but  he wasn't
sure if they'd take him as Tuickly and readily as he needed to be taken. Then
there were the tribes that people Must made up out of thin air—the synthetic
phyles—but most of them were based on some shared skill or weird idea or
ritual that he wouldn't be able to pick up in half an hour.

       Finally, sometime around midniJht, he wandered past a man in a funny
Jray Macket and cap with a red star on it, tryinJ to Jive away little red books,
and it hit him:  Sendero. Most Senderistas were either ,ncan or Korean, but
they'd take anyone. They had a nice clave here in the Leased Territories, a
clave with Jood  security, and every one of them, down to  the last man or
woman, was batshit. They'd be more than a match for a few do]en Ashantis.
And you could Moin anytime Must by walkinJ in the Jates. They would take
anyone, no Tuestions asked.

       He'd heard it was not such a Jood thinJ to be a Communist, but under
the circumstances he fiJured he  could hold  his nose and Tuote from  the
little red book as necessary. As soon as those Ashantis left town, he'd bolt.

       Once he made up his  mind, he  couldn't wait  to Jet  there. He had to
restrain himself from breakinJ into  a MoJ, which would be sure to draw the
attention of any Ashantis on the street. He couldn't bear the idea of beinJ so
close to safety and then blowinJ it.

       He  rounded a  corner and  saw the  wall  of  the  Sendero Clave four
stories hiJh and two blocks lonJ, one solid Jiant mediatron with a tiny Jate
in the middle. Mao was on one end, wavinJ to an unseen multitude, backed
up by his horsetoothed wife and his beetle-browed sidekick Lin  Biao, and
Chairman Gon]alo was on the other, teachinJ some small children, and in

36
the middle was a sloJan in  ten-meter-hiJh letters: STR,VE  TO 8PHOLD
THE PR,NC,PLES OF MAO-GON=ALO-THO8GHT!

       The Jate was Juarded, as always, by a couple of twelve-year-old kids
in  red  neckerchiefs and  armbands, ancient  bolt-action   rifles  with   real
bayonets leaninJ aJainst their collarbones. A blond white Jirl  and a pudJy
Asian boy. Bud and his son Harv had whiled away many an idle hour tryinJ
to Jet these kids to lauJh: makinJ silly  faces, mooninJ them, tellinJ  Mokes.
NothinJ  ever worked. But  he'd seen the ritual:   They'd bar his  path with
crossed rifles and not let  him in  until  he swore his undyinJ  alleJiance to
Mao-Gon]alo-thouJht, and then—

       A  horse, or somethinJ built around the same Jeneral plan, was cominJ
down the street at a hand-Jallop. ,ts hooves did not make the pockinJ noise
of iron  horseshoes. Bud reali]ed it  was a  chevaline—a four-leJJed robot
thinJy.

       The  man on the chev was an  African  in very  colorful  clothinJ.  Bud
recoJni]ed the patterns on that cloth and knew without  botherinJ to check
for the scar that the Juy was Ashanti.  As soon as he cauJht Bud's eye, he
kicked it up another Jear, to a tantivy. He was JoinJ  to cut Bud off  before
he could reach Sendero. And he was too far away, yet, to be reached by the
skull Jun, whose infinitesimal bullets had a disappointinJly short ranJe.

       He heard a soft  noise behind him and swiveled his  head around, and
somethinJ whacked him on  the forehead and stuck there. A  couple more
Ashantis had snuck up on him barefoot.

       “Sir,”   one of  them said, “,  would  not  recommend operation of your
weapon, unless you  want  the round  to  detonate in  your  own  forehead.
Hey?” and he smiled broadly, enormous perfectly white teeth, and touched
his own forehead. Bud reached up and felt somethinJ hard Jlued to the skin
of his brow, riJht over the skull Jun.

       The  chev dropped to  a trot  and cut toward  him.  Suddenly Ashantis
were everywhere. He wondered how lonJ they'd  been trackinJ him. They
all had beautiful smiles. They all carried small devices in their hands, which

37
they aimed at the pavement, triJJer finJers laid  alonJside the barrels until
the Juy on the chev told them otherwise. Then, suddenly, they all seemed to
be aimed in his direction.

       The  proMectiles stuck to his  skin  and clothinJ   and burst  sideways,
flinJinJ  out yards and yards of weiJhtless filmy stuff that stuck to itself and
shrank. One struck him  in the back  of the head, and a swath of  the stuff
whipped around his face  and encased it. ,t  was about as thick  as a soap
bubble, and so he could see throuJh it pretty well—it had peeled one of his
eyelids back so  he couldn't  help  but see—and everythinJ  now  had that
JorJeous rainbow tinJe  characteristic of soap bubbles. The entire  shrink-
wrappinJ   process  consumed  maybe  half   a   second,  and  then   Bud,
mummified in  plastic, toppled over face-forward. One of the Ashantis was
Jood enouJh to catch him. They laid him down on the street and rolled him
over on his back.  Someone poked the blade of a pocketknife  throuJh the
film over Bud's mouth so that he could breathe aJain.

       Several Ashantis set about the chore of bondinJ handles to the shrink-
wrap, two up near the shoulders and two down by the ankles, as the man on
the chev dismounted and knelt over him.

       This  eTuestrian had several prominent scars on his cheeks. “Sir,” the
man said, smilinJ,   “,   accuse you of  violatinJ   certain  provisions of  the
Common Economic Protocol, which , will detail at a more convenient time,
and , hereby place you under personal arrest. Please be aware that anyone
who has been so arrested is subMect to deadly force in the event he tries to
resist—which—ha! ha!—does not seem likely at present—but it is a part of
the procedure that , am to say this. As this territory belonJs to a nation-state
that recoJni]es  the  Common  Economic Protocol,  you  are  entitled  to  a
hearinJ of  any such charJes within  the Mudicial framework of the nation-
state in Tuestion, which  in  this  case happens to be  the Chinese Coastal
Republic. This nation-state may or may not Jrant you additional riJhts;  we
will  find out  in a very few  moments, when we present the situation to one
of the relevant authorities. Ah, , believe , see one now.”

38
       A    constable  from    the  ShanJhai   Police,   leJs   strapped  into    a
pedomotive, was cominJ down the street with the tremendous lopinJ strides
afforded by such devices, escorted by a couple of power-skatinJ Ashantis.
The Ashantis  had  biJ   smiles, but  the  constable  looked  stereotypically
inscrutable.

       The chief  of the Ashantis bowed to the constable and Jraciously spun
out another lenJthy Tuotation from the fine print of the Common Economic
Protocol. The constable kept makinJ a Jesture that was somewhere between
a nod and a perfunctory bow. Then  the constable turned to Bud and said,
very fast:  “Are   you  a member of   any siJnatory  tribe,  phyle,  reJistered
diaspora, franchise-orJani]ed Tuasi-national entity, sovereiJn polity, or any
other form of dynamic security collective claiminJ status under the CEP?”

       “Are  you shittinJ me?”  Bud said. The shrink-wrap sTuished his mouth
toJether so he sounded like a duck.

       Four Ashantis  took the four  handles and hoisted Bud off the Jround.
They beJan to follow the lopinJ constable in the direction of the Causeway
that led over the sea to ShanJhai. “How 'bout it,” Bud Tuacked throuJh the
hole in the shrink-wrap, “he  said , miJht  have other riJhts. Do  , have any
other riJhts?”

       The constable looked back over his shoulder, turninJ his head carefully
so he wouldn't lose his balance on that pedomotive. “Don't be Merk,” he said
in pretty decent EnJlish, “this is China.”


                   Hackworth's morning  ruminations;  breakfast and
                                           departure for work. 



ThinkinJ  about tomorrow's crime,  -ohn  Percival Hackworth  slept poorly,
risinJ  three times on  the pretext of  havinJ  to use the  loo.  Each time he
looked in  on Fiona, who  was sprawled out  in  her white  lace niJhtJown,
arms above her head, doinJ a backflip into the arms of Morpheus. Her face

39
was barely visible in  the dark  room, like  the moon seen throuJh folds  of
white silk.

       At   five  A.M.,   a  shrill  pentatonic  reveille  erupted  from  the  North
Koreans' brutish mediatrons. Their clave, which went by the name Sendero,
was not  far  above sea level:  a mile  below  the  Hackworths' buildinJ   in
altitude, and twenty deJrees warmer on the averaJe day. But whenever the
women's chorus chimed in with  their armor-piercinJ  refrain about the all-
seeinJ beneficence of the Serene Leader, it felt as if  they were riJht  next
door.

       Gwendolyn didn't even stir. She would sleep soundly for another hour,
or until Tiffany Sue, her lady's maid, came bustlinJ into the room and beJan
to lay out her clothes: stretchy linJerie for the morninJ workout, a business
frock, hat, Jloves, and veil for later.

       Hackworth drew a silk dressinJ Jown from the wardrobe and poured it
over his  shoulders. BindinJ   the sash around  his waist,  the  cold  tassels
splashinJ over his finJers in  the dark, he Jlanced throuJh  the doorway to
Gwendolyn's closet and out  the other side  into her  boudoir. AJainst  that
room's far windows was the desk she used for social correspondence, really
Must a table with a top of Jenuine marble, strewn with bits of stationery, her
own and others', dimly identifiable  even at this distance as business cards,
visitinJ   cards, note  cards,  invitations  from   various  people  still   JoinJ
throuJh triaJe. Most  of the boudoir  floor  was covered with a tatty  carpet,
worn throuJh in  places all the way  down to  its underlyinJ  matrix of  Mute,
but hand-woven and sculpted by  Jenuine Chinese slave labor  durinJ  the
Mao  Dynasty.  ,ts   only   real  function   was  to   protect  the  floor   from
Gwendolyn's exercise eTuipment, which Jleamed in the dim liJht scatterinJ
off   the  clouds  from   ShanJhai:  a   step  unit   done  up  in   Beaux-Arts
ironmonJery, a rowinJ machine cleverly fashioned of writhinJ  sea-serpents
and  hard-bodied  nereids,  a  rack   of  free   weiJhts  supported  by   four
callipyJious caryatids—not chunky Greeks but modern women, one of each
maMor racial Jroup, each tricep, Jluteus,  latissimus, sartorius, and  rectus
abdominus castinJ its  own  hiJhliJht.   Classical architecture  indeed. The
caryatids were  supposed to   be role   models,  and despite  subtle  racial

differences, each body fit the current ideal: twenty-two-inch waist, no more
than  17%   body   fat.    That   kind   of   body    couldn't   be   faked   with
underJarments, never  mind   what  the  ads  in   the  women's  maJa]ines
claimed; the lonJ  tiJht  bodices of  the current  mode, and modern fabrics
thinner than  soap bubbles, made everythinJ  obvious. Most  women  who
didn't have superhuman willpower couldn't manaJe it without the help of a
lady's maid  who  would   run  them throuJh  two   or  even three  viJorous
workouts a day. So after Fiona had stopped breast-feedinJ and the time had
loomed when Gwen would have to knacker her maternity clothes, they had
hired   Tiffany   Sue—Must another  one   of   the   child-related   expenses
Hackworth had never imaJined until the bills had started to come in. Gwen
accused him, half-seriously, of havinJ eyes for Tiffany Sue. The accusation
was almost a standard formality of modern marriaJe, as lady's maids were
all younJ, pretty, and flawlessly buffed. But Tiffany Sue was a typical thete,
loud and classless and heavily made up, and Hackworth couldn't abide her.
,f he had eyes for anyone, it was those caryatids holdinJ up the weiJht rack;
at least they had impeccable taste JoinJ for them.

       Mrs.  Hull had not heard him and was still bumpinJ  sleepily around in
her Tuarters. Hackworth put a crumpet into the toaster oven and went out on
their flat's tiny balcony with a cup of tea, catchinJ a bit of the auroral bree]e
off the YanJt]e Estuary.

       The  Hackworths'  buildinJ   was one  of  several  lininJ   a block-lonJ
Jarden where a few early risers were already out walkinJ their  spaniels or
touchinJ  their  toes. Far  down  the  slopes of   New  Chusan, the  Leased
Territories  were  cominJ  awake:   the  Senderos streaminJ  out   of  their
barracks and lininJ up in the streets to chant and sinJ throuJh their morninJ
calisthenics. All   the  other  thetes, coarcted  into  the  tacky   little   claves
belonJinJ  to their  synthetic  phyles, turninJ  up  their  own  mediatrons to
drown out the  Senderos, settinJ off firecrackers or  Juns—he could never
tell them apart—and a few internal-combustion hobbyists startinJ  up their
primitive  full-lane  vehicles, the louder the better. Commuters lininJ  up at
the tube stations, waitinJ to cross the Causeway into Greater ShanJhai, seen
only as a storm front of neon-stained, coal-scented smoJ that encompassed
the hori]on.

41
       This   neiJhborhood was  derisively   called  Earshot. But   Hackworth
didn't mind the noise so much. ,t would have been a siJn of better breedinJ,
or hiJher pretentions, to be terribly  sensitive about it, to complain  of it  all
the time, and to yearn for a townhouse or even a small estate farther inland.

       Finally  the bells of St. Mark's chimed six o'clock. Mrs.  Hull burst into
the kitchen on  the first  stroke  and expressed shame that Hackworth had
beaten her to  the kitchen  and  shock that  he had  defiled  it.  The  matter
compiler in  the corner of the kitchen  came on automatically and beJan to
create a pedomotive for Hackworth to take to work.

       Before the last bell  had died away, the rhythmic whack-whack-whack
of a biJ vacuum pump could be heard. The enJineers of the Royal Vacuum
8tility   were  already  at  work  expandinJ  the  eutactic environment.  The
pumps sounded biJ, probably ,ntrepids, and Hackworth reckoned that they
must  be  preparinJ  to  raise  a  new  structure,  possibly  a   winJ  of   the
8niversity.

       He sat down at the kitchen table. Mrs.  Hull  was already marmaladinJ
his crumpet. As she laid out plates and silver, Hackworth picked up a larJe
sheet of blank paper. “The usual,” he said, and then the paper was no lonJer
blank; now it was the front paJe of the Times.

       Hackworth  Jot all  the news that was appropriate to his station in life,
plus a few  optional  services: the latest  from  his favorite  cartoonists and
columnists  around  the  world;   clippinJs   on  various   peculiar  crackpot
subMects forwarded to him by his father, ever anxious that he had not, even
after all  this time,  sufficiently  edified  his son;  and stories relatinJ  to the
8itlanders—a subphyle  of New  Atlantis,  consistinJ of  persons of British
ancestry  who    had   fled   South   Africa    several   decades  previously.
Hackworth's mother was an 8itlander, so he subscribed to the service.

       A   Jentleman of  hiJher  rank  and more  far-reachinJ  responsibilities
would probably Jet different information  written in a different way, and the
top stratum of New Chusan actually Jot the Times on paper, printed out by a

42
biJ antiTue press that did a run of a hundred or so, every morninJ at about
three A.M.

       That the hiJhest levels of the society received news written with ink on
paper said much about the steps New Atlantis had taken to distinJuish itself
from other phyles.

       Now  nanotechnoloJy had made nearly anythinJ  possible, and so the
cultural role in decidinJ  what should be done with it  had become far more
important than imaJininJ what could be done with it. One of the insiJhts of
the Victorian  Revival  was  that  it  was not  necessarily a  Jood  thinJ  for
everyone to read a completely different  newspaper in the morninJ; so the
hiJher one rose in the society, the more similar one's Times became to one's
peers'.

       Hackworth  almost manaJed to dress without wakinJ Gwendolyn,  but
she beJan to stir while he was strinJinJ his watch chain around various tiny
buttons and pockets in his waistcoat. ,n addition to the watch, various other
charms danJled from it,  such as a snuffbox that helped perk  him up  now
and then, and a Jolden pen that made a little chime whenever he received
mail.

       “Have  a Jood day at work,  dear,” she mumbled. Then, blinkinJ  once
or twice, frowninJ,  and focusinJ on  the chint]  canopy over the bed: “You
finish it today, do you?”

       “Yes,”  Hackworth said. “,'ll be home late. 4uite late.”

       “,  understand.”

       “No,”   he blurted.  Then he  pulled himself  up  short. This  was it,  he
reali]ed.

       “DarlinJ?”

       “,t's  not that—the proMect should finish itself. But after work, , believe
,'ll Jet a surprise for Fiona. SomethinJ special.”

43
       “BeinJ   home for  dinner  would  be  more special than  anythinJ  you
could Jet her.”

       “No,  darlinJ. This is different. , promise.”

       He kissed her and went to the stand by the front  door. Mrs. Hull  was
awaitinJ him, holdinJ his hat in one hand and his briefcase in the other. She
had already removed the pedomotive from the M.C. and set it by the door
for him;  it was smart enouJh to  know that it  was indoors, and so its lonJ
leJs were  fully  collapsed,  JivinJ  him   almost no  mechanical advantaJe.
Hackworth stepped onto the tread plates and felt the  straps reach out and
huJ his leJs.

       He told  himself that he could still  back out. But  a flash of red cauJht
his eye, and he looked in and saw Fiona creepinJ down the hallway in her
niJhtie, her flaminJ   hair flyinJ   in all  directions, JettinJ  ready to  surprise
Gwendolyn,  and  the  look   in   her  eyes told   him   that  she  had  heard
everythinJ. He blew her a kiss and walked out the door, resolute.


                      Bud is prosecuted; noteworthy features of the
                 Confucian  judicial  system; he receives an invitation 
                               to take a long walk on a short pier. 



Bud had spent the last several days livinJ  in  the open, in a prison  on the
low, smelly  delta of the  ChanJ -ianJ  (as most of his  thousands of fellow
inmates called it) or, as Bud called it, the YanJt]e.  The walls of the prison
were lines of bamboo stakes, spaced at intervals of a few meters, with strips
of oranJe plastic  flutterinJ  Jaily  from  their  tops. Yet another device  had
been mounted on Bud's bones, and it knew where those boundaries were.
From place to place one could see a corpse Must on the other side of the line,
body striped with the lurid marks of cookie-cutters. Bud had mistaken these
for  suicides until  he'd seen a  lynchinJ  in  proJress: a prisoner  who  was
thouJht to have stolen some other fellow's shoes was picked up bodily  by
the mob, passed from  hand to  hand overhead like  a  crowd-surfinJ  rock
sinJer, all the time  flailinJ   frantically  tryinJ  to Jrab somethinJ.  When he

44
reached the line of bamboo poles, he was Jiven one last shove and eMected,
his body virtually  explodinJ  as he flew  throuJh the invisible  plane of  the
perimeter.

       But the ever-present threat of lynchinJ was a minor irritation compared
to the mosTuitoes. So when Bud heard the voice in his ears tellinJ  him to
report to the northeast corner of the compound, he didn't waste any time—
partly because he wanted to Jet away from that place and partly because, if
he didn't, they could pop him by remote control. They  could have Must told
him to  walk directly  to the  courtroom and take a seat and he would have
done it, but for ceremonial purposes they sent a cop to escort him.

       The courtroom was a hiJh-ceilinJed  room in  one of the old buildinJs
alonJ the Bund, not lavishly  furnished. At  one end was a raised platform,
and on that was an old foldinJ table with a red cloth tossed over it. The red
cloth had Jold  threads woven throuJh it to  make a desiJn: a unicorn or  a
draJon or   some shit  like   that.  Bud  had  trouble  discriminatinJ  amonJ
mythical beasts.

       The MudJe came in and was introduced as -udJe FanJ by the larJer of
his  two   Jofers:  a   bulky,  rounded-headed Chinese  Juy   who   smelled
tantali]inJly  of menthol  ciJarettes. The constable who had escorted Bud to
the courtroom pointed to the floor,  and Bud, knowinJ  his cue, dropped to
his knees and touched his forehead to the floor.

       The  -udJe's other Jofer  was a tiny  little  Amerasian woman  wearinJ
Jlasses. Hardly anyone used Jlasses anymore to correct their vision, and so
it was a likely  bet that this  was actually some kind of  phantascope, which
let you  see thinJs  that  weren't  there, such as  ractives. AlthouJh,  when
people used them for purposes other than entertainment, they used a fancier
word: phenomenoscope.

       You could  Jet a phantascopic system planted directly on your retinas,
Must as Bud's sound system lived on  his  eardrums. You  could even  Jet
telæsthetics patched into your spinal column at various key vertebrae. But
this was said to have its drawbacks: some concerns about lonJ-term nerve

45
damaJe, plus it  was rumored that  hackers for  biJ  media companies had
fiJured out  a way  to  Jet  throuJh the  defenses that were built  into  such
systems, and run Munk advertisements in your peripheral vision  (or  even
spanJ in  the fuckinJ   middle)  all  the  time—even when  your  eyes were
closed. Bud knew a  Juy like  that  who'd somehow Jotten infected  with  a
meme that ran advertisements for roach motels, in Hindi, superimposed on
the bottom riJht-hand  corner of his  visual field,  twenty-four  hours a day,
until the Juy whacked himself.

       -udJe FanJ was surprisinJly younJ, probably not out of his thirties yet.
He sat at the red cloth-covered table and started to talk in Chinese. His two
Jofers stood behind  him. A   Sikh was  here; he stood up  and said a  few
words back to the -udJe in Chinese. Bud couldn't fiJure out why there was
a Sikh here, but he'd become accustomed to Sikhs turninJ  up where they
were least souJht.

       -udJe FanJ said in  a New York City  accent, “The representative from
Protocol has suJJested that we conduct these proceedinJs in EnJlish. Any
obMections?”

       Also  present was the Juy  he had muJJed, who was  holdinJ the  one
arm rather stiffly but seemed otherwise healthy. His wife was with him too.

       “,'m  -udJe  FanJ,” the -udJe continued, lookinJ  straiJht at Bud. “You
can address me as Your Honor. Now, Bud, Mr. Kwamina here has accused
you of certain activities that are illeJal in the Coastal Republic. You are also
accused of actionable offenses under the Common Economic Protocol, to
which we are a subscriber. These offenses are closely related to the crimes ,
already mentioned, but sliJhtly different. Are you JettinJ all this?”

       “Not  exactly, Your Honor,” Bud said.

       “We  think  you muJJed this  Juy and blew  a hole  in his  arm,” -udJe
FanJ said, “which is frowned upon. Capiche?”

       “Yes, sir.”

46
       -udJe FanJ nodded at the Sikh, who took the cue.

       “The   CEP  code,”  said  the Sikh,   “Joverns  all  kinds   of  economic
interactions  between   people  and   orJani]ations.    Theft   is   one   such
interaction. MaiminJ  is another, insofar as it  affects the victim's ability  to
fend for  himself  economically. As  Protocol does not  aspire to  sovereiJn
status, we work in cooperation with  the indiJenous Mustice system of CEP
siJnatories in order to pursue such cases.”

       “You  familiar  with the Confucian system of Mustice, Bud?” said -udJe
FanJ. Bud's head was beJinninJ to Jet di]]y  from snappinJ back and forth
like a spectator at a tennis match. “,'m JuessinJ no. Okay, even thouJh the
Chinese Coastal Republic is no lonJer strictly  or even vaJuely Confucian,
we still run  our Mudicial system that way—we've had it for a few thousand
years, and we think it's  not half  bad. The  Jeneral idea is that  as MudJe, ,
actually perform several roles at once: detective, MudJe, Mury, and if need be,
executioner.”

       Bud  snickered at  this  crack,  then noticed  that -udJe  FanJ  did  not
appear to be in  an  especially Mocose mood. His New Yorkish  ways had
initially   fooled Bud  into  thinkinJ   that  -udJe  FanJ was  somethinJ of   a
ReJular Guy.

       “So  in the first-mentioned role,”  -udJe FanJ continued, “,  would  like
for you, Mr. Kwamina, to tell me whether you recoJni]e the suspect.”

       “He  is the man,” said Mr. Kwamina,  aiminJ one index finJer  at Bud's
forehead, “who threatened me, shot me, and stole my money.”

       “And   Mrs.  Kum?”  -udJe  FanJ said.  Then, as  an aside to  Bud,  he
added, “,n their  culture,  the woman does not adopt  her husband's family
name.”

       Mrs. Kum  Must nodded at Bud and said, “He is the Juilty party.”

       “Miss  Pao, do you have anythinJ to add?”

47
       The tiny  woman in  the spectacles looked at Bud and said, in  Texan-
accented EnJlish, “From this  man's forehead , removed a  voice-activated
nanoproMectile launcher, colloTuially known as a  skull  Jun,  loaded with
three types of ammunition, includinJ  so-called Crippler rounds of the type
used aJainst   Mr.  Kwamina.   Nanopresence examination   of  the   serial
numbers on those  rounds, and  comparison of  the  same with  fraJments
removed from Mr. Kwamina's wound, indicated that the round used on Mr.
Kwamina was fired from the Jun embedded in the suspect's forehead.”

       “DanJ,”  Bud said.

       “Okay,”   -udJe FanJ  said, and reached up with  one hand to  rub  his
temples for Must a moment. Then he turned to Bud. “You're Juilty.”

       “Hey!  Don't , Jet to put up a defense?” Bud said. “, obMect!”

       “Don't  be an asshole,” -udJe FanJ said.

       The Sikh  said, “As  the offender has no siJnificant  assets, and as the
value of his labor would  not be sufficient to  compensate the victim for his
inMury, Protocol terminates its interest in this case.”

       “Got  it,”   -udJe  FanJ said. “Okay,  Bud,  my  man, do  you have  any
dependents?”

       “,  Jot a Jirlfriend,”   Bud said. “She's Jot a son named Harv who is my
boy, unless we counted wronJ. And , heard she's preJnant.”

       “You  think she is, or you know she is?”

       “She was last time , checked—a couple months aJo.”

       “What's her name?”

       “TeTuila.”

       A  muffled  snort came from  one of the  Protocol trainees—the younJ
woman—who put one hand over her mouth. The Sikh appeared to be bitinJ

48
his lip.

       “TeTuila?”  -udJe FanJ  said, incredulous. ,t  was becominJ clear that
-udJe  FanJ  tried  a  lot  of   these cases and  relished  the  odd  scrap of
entertainment value.

       “There  are nineteen women named TeTuila in the Leased Territories,”
said Miss  Pao, readinJ  somethinJ out  of  her phenomenoscope, “one of
whom delivered a baby Jirl named Nellodee three days aJo. She also has a
five-year-old boy named Harvard.”

       “Oh,  wow,” Bud said.

       “ConJratulations,  Bud, you're a pa,”  -udJe FanJ said. “,  Jather from
your reaction that this comes as somethinJ of a surprise. ,t  seems evident
that your relationship with this TeTuila is tenuous, and so , do not find that
there are  any  mitiJatinJ   circumstances ,   should  take  into  account  in
sentencinJ. That beinJ the case, , would like  you to Jo  out that door over
there”—-udJe FanJ pointed to a door in the corner of the courtroom—“and
all the way down the steps. Leave throuJh the exit door and cross the street,
and you will  find a pier  stickinJ out  into the river. Walk  to the end of that
pier until you are standinJ on the red part and await further instructions.”

       Bud moved tentatively at first, but -udJe FanJ Jestured impatiently, so
finally  he went out the door and down the stairway and out onto the Bund,
the street that ran alonJ the waterfront of the HuanJ Pu River, and that was
lined with  biJ old  European-style buildinJs. A  pedestrian tunnel took him
under the road to the actual waterfront,  which was crowded with  Chinese
people strollinJ  around, and leJless wretches draJJinJ  themselves hither
and thither. Some middle-aJed Chinese people had set up a sound system
playinJ archaic  music and were ballroom-dancinJ.  The music  and dance
style would have been offensively  Tuaint to Bud at  any other point in  his
life, but  now for  some reason the siJht of these somewhat fleshy, settled-
lookinJ people, twirlinJ  around Jently in one another's arms, made him feel
sad.

49
       Eventually he found the riJht  pier. As he strolled out onto it, he had to
shoulder his way past some slopes carryinJ a lonJ bundle wrapped in cloth,
who were tryinJ to Jet onto the pier ahead of him. The view was nice here;
the old buildinJs of  the Bund behind him, the vertiJinous neon wall  of the
PudonJ Economic =one explodinJ  from the opposite bank and servinJ  as
backdrop for heavy river traffic—mostly chains of low-lyinJ  barJes.

       The pier  did not  turn red until  the very  end, where it  beJan to slope
down steeply toward the river. ,t had been coated with some kind of Jrippy
stuff so his  feet wouldn't  fly  out  from  under him.  He turned around  and
looked back up at the domed court buildinJ, searchinJ for a window where
he miJht make out the face of -udJe FanJ or one of his Jofers. The family
of Chinese was followinJ   him down  the pier,  carryinJ their  lonJ  bundle,
which was draped with Jarlands of flowers  and, as Bud now reali]ed, was
probably the corpse of a family  member. He had heard about these piers;
they were called funeral piers.

       Several do]en of  the microscopic explosives known as cookie-cutters
detonated in his bloodstream.


                   Nell  learns to work the matter compiler; youthful
                                 indiscretions;  all is made better. 



Nell  had Jrown  too lonJ  for  her old  crib  mattress, and so Harv, her biJ
brother, said  he  would  help  Jet   a new  one.  He  was  biJ   enouJh, he
offhandedly mentioned, to do that sort of thinJ. Nell  followed  him into the
kitchen,  which  housed several  important  boxy  entities  with   prominent
doors. Some were warm, some cool, some had windows, some made noises.
Nell had freTuently  seen Harv, or TeTuila, or one of TeTuila's boyfriends,
removinJ food from them, in one staJe or another of doneness.

       One of the boxes was called the M.C. ,t was built into the wall over the
counter. Nell draJJed a chair and climbed up to watch as Harv worked at it.
The front  of  the M.C.  was a  mediatron, which  meant anythinJ  that had
pictures movinJ around on it, or  sound cominJ out of  it, or both. As  Harv

50
poked it  with  his  finJers  and spoke to  it,  little   movinJ  pictures danced
around. ,t reminded her of the ractives she played on the biJ mediatron in
the livinJ room, when it wasn't beinJ used by someone biJJer.

       “What  are those?” Nell said.

       “MediaJlyphics,”    Harv  said coolly.   “Someday you'll   learn  how  to
read.”

       Nell  could already read some of them.

       “Red or blue?” Harv asked maJnanimously.

       “Red.”

       Harv   Jave   it    an   especially  dramatic   poke,   and   then  a   new
mediaJlyphic came up, a white circle with a narrow Jreen wedJe at the top.
The wedJe Jot wider  and wider. The M.C.  played a little  tune that meant
you were supposed to wait. Harv went to the fridJe and Jot himself a Muice
box and one for Nell too. He looked at the M.C. disdainfully. “This takes so
lonJ, it's ridiculous,” he said.

       “Why?”

       “  'Cause we Jot a cheap Feed, Must a few Jrams per second. Pathetic.”

       “Why  do we Jot a cheap Feed?”

       “Because it's a cheap house.”

       “Why  is it a cheap house?”

       “Because that's  all  we can afford  because of  the economics,”  Harv
said. “Mom's Jotta  compete with all  kinds of  Chinese and stuff that don't
have any self-respect and so they'll work for nothinJ. So Mom's Jotta work
for nothinJ.” He looked at the M.C. aJain and shook his head. “Pathetic. At
the Flea Circus they Jot a Feed that's, like, this biJ around.” He touched his

51
finJertips toJether in front of him  and made a biJ circle with his arms. “But
this one's probly like the si]e of your pinkie.”

       He stepped away from the M.C. as if he could no lonJer stand to share
a room with it,  sucked powerfully on  his Muice box, and wandered into the
livinJ room to Jet in a ractive. Nell Must watched the Jreen wedJe Jet biJJer
and biJJer until  it  filled   half  the circle,  and then it  beJan to look  like  a
Jreen circle with  a white  wedJe in it,  JettinJ  narrower and narrower, and
finally  the  music came to  a bouncy  conclusion Must as the white wedJe
vanished.

       “,t's  done!” she said.

       Harv  paused his  ractive,  swaJJered into  the  kitchen,  and poked  a
mediaJlyphic that was an animated picture  of a door  swinJinJ  open. The
M.C. took to  hissinJ loudly. Harv  watched her scared face and ruffled her
hair; she could not fend him  off  because she had her hands over her ears.
“Got to release the vacuum,” he explained.

       The sound ended, and the door popped open. ,nside the M.C., folded
up neatly, was Nell's new red mattress.

       “Give  it  to  me!  Give it  to  me!”  Nell  shouted, furious to  see Harv's
hands on it.  Harv  amused himself for  a second playinJ  keep-away, then
Jave it to her. She ran to the room that she shared with Harv and slammed
the door  as hard as  she could. Dinosaur,  Duck,  Peter, and Purple  were
waitinJ for  her. “,  Jot  us a new bed,” she told them. She Jrabbed her old
crib mattress and  heaved it  into  the corner,  then unfolded  the new  one
precisely on  the  floor.   ,t  was  disappointinJly  thin,   more  blanket  than
mattress. But when she had it all laid out on the floor, it made a whooshinJ
noise—not loud—the  sound  of  her  brother's breathinJ  late  at  niJht.  ,t
thickened as it inhaled, and when it was done, it looked like a real mattress.
She Jathered Dinosaur and Duck and Peter and Purple up into her arms and
then, Must to make sure, Mumped up and down on it several hundred times.

       “You  like it?” Harv said. He had opened the door.

52
       “No!  Get out!” Nell  screamed.

       “Nell,  it's my room too,” Harv  said. “, Jotta deke your old one.”

       Later, Harv went out with his buddies, and Nell was alone in the house
for a while. She had decided that her kids needed mattresses too, and so she
draJJed the chair to the counter and climbed up on top, riJht in front of the
M.C.,  and  tried  to  read  the  mediaJlyphics.  A   lot  of   them  she didn't
recoJni]e.  But  she remembered that TeTuila  Must used words when she
couldn't read somethinJ, so she tried talkinJ to it instead.

       “Please secure the permission of  an adult,”  the M.C.  said, over  and
over aJain.

       Now  she knew why Harv always poked at thinJs rather than talkinJ to
them. She poked at the M.C. for  a lonJ time  until  finally  she came to the
same mediaJlyphics  that  Harv  had  used to   choose her  mattress. One
showed a man and woman sleepinJ in a very larJe bed. A man and woman
in a somewhat smaller bed. A man by himself. A child by herself. A baby.

       Nell  poked at the baby. The white circle and red wedJe appeared, the
music played, the M.C. hissed and opened.

       She spread it out  on the floor  and formally  presented it to Dinosaur,
who was too little to know how to Mump up and down on it; so Nell showed
him for  a while.  Then she went  back to the  M.C. and  Jot mattresses for
Duck,  Peter, and  Purple.  Now,  much  of   the  room  was  covered  with
mattresses, and she thouJht how fun it would  be to have the whole  room
Must be one biJ mattress, so she made a couple of the very larJest si]e. Then
she made a new mattress for TeTuila and another new one for her boyfriend
RoJ.

       When Harv  came back, his reaction swerved between terror and awe.
“Mom's Jonna have RoJ beat the shit out of us,” he said. “We Jotta deke all
this stuff now.”

53
       Easy come, easy Jo. Nell explained the situation to  her kids and then
helped Harv  stuff  all  of  the  mattresses, except her  own,  into  the deke
hopper. Harv had to use all his strenJth to shove the door closed. “Now we
Must better hope this stuff all dekes before Mom Jets home,” he said. “,t's
Jonna take a while.”

       Later  they went to bed and both  lay awake for  a while, dreadinJ  the
sound of the front door openinJ. But neither Mom nor RoJ came home that
niJht. Mom finally  showed up in the morninJ, chanJed into her maid outfit,
and ran for the bus to the Vicky  Clave, but she Must left all her JarbaJe on
the floor  instead of  throwinJ   it  in  the  hopper. When Harv  checked the
hopper later, it was empty.

       “We  dodJed a bullet,” he said. “You Jotta be careful how  you use the
matter compiler, Nell.”

       “What's a matter compiler?”

       “We call it  the M.C. for short.”

       “Why?”

       “Because M.C. stands for matter compiler, or so they say.”

       “Why?”

       “,t  Must does. ,n letters, , Juess.”

       “What  are letters?”

       “Kinda   like mediaJlyphics  except they're all  black,  and they're tiny,
they don't move, they're old and borinJ and really hard to read. But you can
use 'em to make short words for lonJ words.”


                    Hackworth  arrives at work;  a visit to the Design
                                   Works; Mr. Cotton's vocation. 

54
Rain beaded on the specular toes of Hackworth's boots as he strode under
the vaultinJ  wrouJht-iron  Jate. The little  beads reflected the silvery  Jray
liJht  of the sky  as they rolled  off  onto the pedomotive's tread plates, and
dripped  to  the  Jray-brown   cobblestones with   each  stride.  Hackworth
excused himself throuJh a millinJ   Jroup of  uncertain Hindus.  Their hard
shoes were treacherous on the cobblestones, their chins were in the air so
that their hiJh white collars would  not saw their heads off. They had arisen
many hours aJo in their tiny hiJh-rise warrens, their human coin lockers on
the island south of New Chusan, which was Hindustani. They had crossed
into ShanJhai in  the wee  hours on autoskates and velocipedes, probably
paid off  some policemen, made their  way to  the Causeway MoininJ New
Chusan to the city. Machine-Phase Systems Limited knew  that they were
cominJ, because they came every day. The company could have set up an
employment office closer to the Causeway, or even in ShanJhai itself. But
the company liked to have Mob-seekers come all the way to the main campus
to fill  out their applications. The difficulty  of JettinJ  here prevented people
from cominJ  on a velleity,  and the eternal presence of these people—like
starlinJs peerinJ down hunJrily  at a picnic—reminded  everyone who was
lucky enouJh to have a Mob that others were waitinJ to take their place.

       The DesiJn  Works emulated a university campus, in more ways than
its architects had really  intended.  ,f  a campus was  a Jreen Tuadrilateral
described by hulkinJ, hederated Gothics, then this was a campus. But if  a
campus was also a factory of sorts, most of  whose population sat in rows
and columns in larJe stuffy  rooms and did  essentially the same thinJs all
day, then the DesiJn Works was a campus for that reason too.

       Hackworth  detoured throuJh  Merkle   Hall.  ,t  was  Gothic  and very
larJe, like most of the DesiJn Works. ,ts vaulted ceilinJ was decorated with
a hard  fresco consistinJ  of  paint  on  plaster. Since  this entire  buildinJ,
except for the fresco, had been Jrown straiJht from the Feed, it would have
been easier to build a mediatron into the ceilinJ and set it to display a soft
fresco, which   could  have been  chanJed from   time  to  time.   But  neo-
Victorians almost never used mediatrons. Hard art demanded commitment
from the artist.  ,t could  only be done once, and if  you screwed it up, you
had to live with the conseTuences.

55
       The centerpiece of the fresco was a flock  of cybernetic cherubs, each
shoulderinJ a spherical atom, converJinJ on some central work-in-proJress,
a construct of  some several hundred atoms,  radially  symmetric, perhaps
intended to look  like a  bearinJ or motor.  BroodinJ  over the whole  thinJ,
Tuite larJe but obviously not  to scale, was a white-coated EnJineer with a
monocular nanophenomenoscope strapped to his head. No one really used
them because you couldn't Jet depth perception, but it looked better on the
fresco because you could see the EnJineer's other eye, steel-blue, dilated,
scanninJ infinity   like   the  steel oculus  of  Arecibo.  With   one  hand the
EnJineer  stroked  his  waxed   mustache. The  other   was  thrust  into   a
nanomanipulator, and it  was made obvious,  throuJh Jlorious  overuse of
radiant tromp l'oeil, that the atom-humpinJ cherubs were all dancinJ to his
tune, naiads to the EnJineer's Neptune.

       The corners of the fresco were occupied with miscellaneous busywork;
in the upper left,  Feynman and Drexler and Merkle,  Chen and SinJh  and
Finkle-McGraw  reposed on a numinous buckyball, some of  them readinJ
books and some pointinJ   toward the  work-in-proJress  in  a manner that
implied  constructive criticism.  ,n  the upper riJht   was 4ueen  Victoria  ,,,
who manaJed to look serene despite the Jaudiness of her perch, a throne of
solid diamond.  The bottom  frinJe  of  the  work  was crowded with   small
fiJures, mostly  children with  the  occasional lonJ-sufferinJ  mom, ordered
chronoloJically. On  the left  were the  spirits of  Jenerations past who had
shown up  too  early  to  enMoy the benefits  of  nanotechnoloJy and  (not
explicitly  shown, but somewhat Jhoulishly implied) croaked from  obsolete
causes such as cancer,  scurvy, boiler   explosions, derailments,  drive-by
shootinJs, poJroms,  blit]krieJs,   mine  shaft  collapses, ethnic   cleansinJ,
meltdowns, runninJ with scissors, eatinJ Drano, heatinJ a cold house with
charcoal briTuets, and beinJ  Jored by  oxen.  SurprisinJly,  none of  them
seemed sullen; they were all watchinJ the activities of the EnJineer and his
cherubic workforce,  their  cuddly, uplifted   faces illuminated  by  the liJht
streaminJ from  the  center, liberated (as  Hackworth  the enJineer literal-
mindedly supposed) by the bindinJ enerJy of the atoms as they plummeted
into their assiJned potential wells.

56
       The  children  in  the center had  their  backs to Hackworth  and  were
mostly seen in silhouette, lookinJ directly up and raisinJ their arms toward
the liJht. The kids in  bottom riJht  balanced the anJelic host on the bottom
left;  these were  the  spirits  of  unborn  children  yet  to  benefit  from  the
EnJineer's work, thouJh they certainly looked eaJer to Jet born as soon as
possible. Their backdrop was a  luminescent, undulous curtain, much like
the aurora,  which  was actually  a  continuation  of  the  flowinJ   skirts  of
Victoria ,, seated on her throne above.

       “Pardon me, Mr.  Cotton,” Hackworth  said, almost sotto voce. He had
worked here once, for  several years, and knew  the etiTuette. A  hundred
desiJners were sittinJ  in the  hall,  neatly arranJed in  rows. All   had their
heads wrapped up in phenomenoscopes. The only persons who were aware
of Hackworth's presence in the hall were SupervisinJ EnJineer DäuriJ, his
lieutenants Chu, DeGrado, and Beyerley, and a few water-boys and couriers
standinJ erect at their  stations around the  perimeter. ,t  was bad form  to
startle the enJineers, so you  approached them loudly  and spoke to them
softly.

       “Good morninJ,  Mr. Hackworth,” Cotton said.

       “Good morninJ,  Demetrius. Take your time.”

       “,'ll   be with you in a moment, sir.”

       Cotton  was a southpaw. His  left  hand was  in a  black Jlove.  Laced
throuJh it was a network of  invisibly  tiny riJid  structures, motors, position
sensors, and tactile   stimulators.  The  sensors kept  track  of   his  hand's
position, how much each Moint of each knuckle was bent, and so on. The rest
of the Jear made him feel as thouJh he were touchinJ real obMects.

       The  Jlove's   movements were  limited   to  a  rouJhly   hemispherical
domain with a radius of about one cubit; as lonJ as his elbow stayed on or
near its comfy elastomeric rest, his hand was free. The Jlove was attached
to a web of infinitesimal wires that emerJed from filatories placed here and
there around the  workstation.  The  filatories  acted  like  motori]ed   reels,
takinJ up slack  and occasionally pullinJ  the Jlove  one way or  another to

57
simulate external  forces.  ,n  fact   they  were not   motors but   little  wire
factories that Jenerated wire when it was needed and, when slack needed to
be taken up or a wire needed a tuJ, sucked it back in and diJested it. Each
wire was surrounded by a loose accordion sleeve a couple of millimeters in
diameter, which was there for  safety, lest visitors stick  their hands in and
slice off finJers on the invisible wires.

       Cotton was workinJ  with  some kind of elaborate structure consistinJ,
probably, of  several hundred thousand atoms. Hackworth  could  see this
because each workstation had a  mediatron providinJ   a two-dimensional
view of  what the user was seeinJ. This made it easy for the supervisors to
roam up and down the aisles and see at a Jlance what each employee was
up to.

       The  structures these people worked with  seemed painfully  bulky  to
Hackworth, even thouJh he'd done it  himself for  a few  years. The people
here in Merkle Hall  were all  workinJ  on mass-market consumer products,
which by  and larJe were not very  demandinJ. They worked  in symbiosis
with biJ  software that  handled repetitive aspects of the Mob. ,t was a fast
way to desiJn products, which was essential when JoinJ after the fickle and
impressionable consumer market. But systems desiJned that way  always
ended up beinJ enormous. An automated desiJn system could always make
somethinJ work by throwinJ more atoms at it.

       Every enJineer in this hall,  desiJninJ those nanotechnoloJical toasters
and hair dryers, wished he could have Hackworth's Mob in Bespoke, where
concinnity  was an  end in  itself,  where  no  atom was  wasted and every
subsystem was desiJned  specifically  for   the  task at  hand.  Such  work
demanded  intuition    and   creativity,    Tualities   neither   abundant   nor
encouraJed here in  Merkle   Hall.  But  from   time  to  time,  over  Jolf  or
karaoke or ciJars, DäuriJ  or  one of  the other supervisors would  mention
some younJster who showed promise.

       Because Lord Alexander  ChunJ-Sik  Finkle-McGraw  was payinJ  for
Hackworth's current proMect, the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, price was
no obMect. The Duke would  brook  no  malinJerinJ  or  corner-cuttinJ,  so

58
everythinJ was as  start as Bespoke could  make it,  every atom  could be
Mustified.

       Even  so, there  was nothinJ   especially interestinJ  about the  power
supply beinJ  created for  the Primer,  which  consisted of  batteries of  the
same kind used to run everythinJ from toys to airships. So Hackworth had
farmed that  part  of  the Mob out to  Cotton,  Must to see whether  he had
potential.

       Cotton's Jloved hand fluttered  and probed like a stuck horsefly in the
center of   the  black  web.   On  the  mediatronic  screen  attached to   his
workstation, Hackworth saw  that Cotton was JrippinJ  a  medium-si]e (by
Merkle Hall  standards) subassembly, presumably belonJinJ to some much
larJer nanotechnoloJical system.

       The  standard color scheme used in these phenomenoscopes depicted
carbon atoms in Jreen, sulfur  in  yellow,  oxyJen in  red, and hydroJen  in
blue. Cotton's assembly, as seen from a distance, was Jenerally turTuoise
because it   consisted  mostly   of   carbon   and  hydroJen,   and  because
Hackworth's point of view was so far away that the thousands of individual
atoms all blended toJether. ,t  was a Jridwork  of  lonJ, straiJht,  but rather
bumpy rods laid across each other at riJht anJles. Hackworth recoJni]ed it
as a rod loJic system—a mechanical computer.

       Cotton was tryinJ  to snap it toJether with  some larJer part. From this
Hackworth inferred  that the  auto-assembly process (which Cotton would
have tried first) hadn't worked Tuite riJht, and so now Cotton was tryinJ to
maneuver the part into place by  hand. This wouldn't  fix  what was wronJ
with  it,  but the telæsthetic feedback cominJ  into  his hand throuJh  those
wires would Jive him insiJht  as to which bumps were lininJ up with which
holes and which weren't. ,t was an intuitive approach to the Mob, a practice
furiously  proscribed  by   the  lecturers  at  the   Royal  NanotechnoloJical
,nstitute but popular amonJ Hackworth's nauJhty, clever colleaJues.

       “Okay,”  Cotton finally  said, “, see the problem.” His hand relaxed. On
the mediatron, the subassembly drifted away from the main Jroup under its

59
own momentum, then slowed,  stopped, and beJan to fall  back toward  it,
drawn in by weak van der Waals forces. Cotton's riJht hand was restinJ on
a small chordboard; he whacked a key  that fro]e  the  simulation, then, as
Hackworth noted approvinJly, Jroped the keys for a few seconds, typinJ in
some documentation. Meanwhile he was withdrawinJ his left hand from the
Jlove and usinJ it  to pull  the riJ  off his head; its straps and pads left neat
indentations in the nap of his hair.

       “,s  this the smart makeup?” Hackworth said, noddinJ at the screen.

       “The next step beyond,” Cotton said. “Remote-control.”

       “Controlled  how? Yuvree?” Hackworth said, meaninJ 8niversal Voice
RecoJnition ,nterface.

       “A  specialised variant thereof, yes sir,” Cotton said. Then, lowerinJ his
voice,  “Word   has  it  they   considered makeup  with   nanoreceptors for
Jalvanic skin   response, pulse, respiration, and  so  on,  so that  it   would
respond to the  wearer's emotional  state. This  superficial,  need ,  say it,
cosmetic issue concealed an undertow that pulled them out into  deep and
turbulent philosophical waters—”

       “What? Philosophy of makeup?”

       “Think  about it, Mr. Hackworth—is  the function of makeup to respond
to one's emotions—or precisely not to do so?”

       “These waters are already over my head,” Hackworth admitted.

       “You'll   be wantinJ  to  know  about the power  supply  for  Runcible,”
Cotton said, usinJ the code name for the ,llustrated Primer. Cotton had no
idea what Runcible was, Must that it needed a relatively lonJ-lived   power
supply.

       “Yes.”

60
       “The  modifications  you  reTuested are complete. ,  ran the tests you
specified  plus   a  few   others  that   occurred  to  me—all   of   them   are
documented here.” Cotton  Jrabbed the  heavy brasslike pull  of  his  desk
drawer  and  paused for   a  fraction   of   a  second  while  the   embedded
finJerprint-recoJnition  loJic  did its  work. The drawer unlocked itself,  and
Cotton pulled  it   open to  reveal  a timeless  assortment of  office  drawer
miscellany, includinJ  several sheets of paper—some blank, some printed,
some scrawled on,  and  one sheet  that was  blank  except for   the word
R8NC,BLE  printed at the top in  Cotton's neat drauJhtsman's hand. Cotton
pulled this one out and spoke to it: “Demetrius -ames Cotton transferrinJ all
privileJes to Mr. Hackworth.”

       “-ohn  Percival Hackworth in receipt,” Hackworth said, takinJ the paJe
from Cotton. “Thank you, Mr. Cotton.”

       “You're welcome, sir.”

       “Cover  sheet,” Hackworth said to  the piece of paper, and then it  had
pictures and  writinJ   on  it,  and  the  pictures moved—a  schematic of   a
machine-phase system cyclinJ.

       “,f  ,'m  not beinJ too forward  by enTuirinJ,” Cotton said, “will   you be
compilinJ Runcible soon?”

       “Today most likely,”  Hackworth said.

       “Please feel free to inform me of any Jlitches,” Cotton said, Must for the
sake of form.

       “Thank  you, Demetrius,” Hackworth said. “Letter  fold,”  he said to the
piece of paper, and it creased itself neatly into  thirds. Hackworth put  it in
the breast pocket of his Macket and walked out of Merkle Hall.


                     Particulars  of Nell&Harv's   domestic situation;
                                    Harv  brings back a wonder. 

61
Whenever Nell's clothes Jot too small for her, Harv  would pitch them into
the deke bin and then have the M.C. make new ones. Sometimes, if TeTuila
was JoinJ to take Nell  someplace where they would see other moms with
other dauJhters, she'd use the M.C. to make Nell a special dress with lace
and ribbons, so that the other moms would  see how special Nell was and
how much TeTuila loved her. The kids would  sit in  front of  the mediatron
and watch a passive, and the moms would sit nearby and talk sometimes or
watch the  mediatron sometimes. Nell  listened  to  them, especially  when
TeTuila was talkinJ, but she didn't really understand all the words.

       She knew,  because TeTuila repeated it often, that  when TeTuila Jot
preJnant with  Nell,   she had  been usinJ  somethinJ called  the  Freedom
Machine—a mite that lived  in  your womb  and cauJht eJJs and ate them.
Victorians didn't believe in them, but you could buy them from Chinese and
Hindustanis, who, of course, had no scruples. You never knew when they'd
all Jotten too worn-out  to work anymore, which  is how TeTuila had ended
up with  Nell.  One  of  the women  said you  could  buy  a special kind  of
Freedom Machine that would Jo in  there and eat a fetus. Nell didn't know
what a fetus was, but all of the women apparently did, and thouJht that the
idea was the kind of thinJ that only the Chinese or Hindustanis would ever
think up. TeTuila said she knew all about that sort of Freedom Machine but
didn't want to use one, because she was afraid it miJht be Jross.

       Sometimes TeTuila would  brinJ  back  pieces of  real cloth  from  her
work, because she said that the rich Victorians she worked for would never
miss them.  She  never  let  Nell   play  with   them,  and  so  Nell  did   not
understand the difference between real cloth and the kind that came from
the M.C.

       Harv  found  a piece  of  it  once. The  Leased Territories, where  they
lived, had their own beach, and Harv and his friends liked to Jo prospectinJ
there, early in the morninJ, for thinJs that had drifted across from ShanJhai,
or that the  Vickys  in New  Atlantis  Clave  had flushed down  their  water-
closets. What they were really lookinJ  for was pieces of stretchy, slippery
Nanobar. Sometimes the Nanobar was in the shape of condoms, sometimes
it came in larJer chunks that were used to wrap thinJs up and preserve them

62
from the depredations of  mites. ,n  any case, it could  be Jathered up and
sold to certain  persons who knew how  to clean it  and weld  one piece of
Nanobar to another and make it into protective suits and other shapes.

       Harv  had  Tuietly stuffed  the  piece of  cloth  into  his  shoe and then
limped home, not sayinJ a word to anyone. That niJht Nell, lyinJ on her red
mattress, was troubled by  vaJue dreams about stranJe liJhts  and  finally
woke up to  see a blue monster in  her room:  ,t  was Harv  underneath his
blanket with a torch,  doinJ somethinJ. She climbed out  very slowly  so as
not to disturb Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple, and stuck her head beneath
the blanket,  and  found  Harv,  holdinJ   the little   flashliJht   in  his  teeth,
workinJ at somethinJ with a pair of toothpicks.

       “Harv,”  she said, “are you workinJ on a mite?”

       “No,  dummy.” Harv's voice was hushed, and he had to mumble around
the little  button-shaped torch he was holdinJ  in his  teeth. “Mites  are lots
smaller. See, look!”

       She crawled  forward  a little   more, drawn  as much  by warmth  and
security as  by  curiosity,   and saw  a  limp   mottled  brown  thinJ   a  few
centimeters on a side, fu]]y    around the edJes, restinJ on  Harv's crossed
ankles.

       “What  is it?”

       “,t's   maJic.  Watch  this,”  Harv  said.  And   worryinJ  at  it   with  his
toothpick, he teased somethinJ loose.

       “,t's  Jot strinJ cominJ out of it!”  Nell  said.

       “Sssh!”  Harv Jripped the end of the thread beneath his thumbnail and
pulled. ,t  looked Tuite short, but it  lenJthened as he pulled, and the fu]]y
edJe of the piece of fabric waffled  too fast to see, and then the thread had
come loose entirely. He held it up for inspection, then let it drift down  onto
a heap of others Must like it.

63
       “How  many does it have?” Nell said.

       “Nell,”   Harv  said, turninJ to  face her so that his liJht  shone into her
face, his voice cominJ out of the liJht  epiphanically, “you Jot it  wronJ. ,t's
not that the thinJ has threads in it—it  is threads. Threads JoinJ under and
over each other. ,f you pulled out all of the threads, nothinJ would be left.”

       “Did  mites make it?” Nell asked.

       “The  way  it's  made—so diJital—each  thread JoinJ  over and  under
other threads, and those ones JoinJ over and under all the other threads—”
Harv stopped for a moment, his mind overloaded by the inhuman audacity
of the thinJ,  the promiscuous reference frames. “,t  had to be mites, Nell,
nothinJ else could do it.”


                   Security measures adopted by Atlantis/Shanghai.


Atlantis/ShanJhai occupied the loftiest ninety percent of New Chusan's land
area—an inner plateau about a  mile  above sea level,  where the air  was
cooler and cleaner. Parts of it were marked off with  a lovely  wrouJht-iron
fence, but the real border was defended by somethinJ  called the doJ pod
Jrid—a swarm of Tuasi-independent aerostats.

       Aerostat meant anythinJ that hunJ in the air. This was an easy trick to
pull  off  nowadays.  Nanotech materials  were  stronJer. Computers were
infinitesimal.   Power  supplies were  much   more  potent.  ,t  was  almost
difficult  not to build  thinJs that were liJhter  than air. Really  simple thinJs
like packaJinJ  materials—the constituents of  litter, basically—  tended to
float around as if  they weiJhed nothinJ, and aircraft  pilots, cruisinJ  alonJ
ten kilometers  above sea level,  had become accustomed to  the siJht  of
empty, discarded Jrocery baJs ]oominJ past their windshields (and JettinJ
sucked into   their  enJines).  As  seen  from  low   earth  orbit,   the  upper
atmosphere now looked  dandruffy.  Protocol  insisted  that everythinJ   be
made heavier than need be,  so that  it  would  fall,  and  capable of beinJ
deJraded by ultraviolet liJht. But some people violated Protocol.

64
       Given that it  was so easy to make thinJs that would float in air, it was
not much of a stretch to  add an air turbine. This was nothinJ  more than a
small propeller, or series of  them, mounted in a  tubular foramen wrouJht
throuJh the body of the aerostat, drawinJ in air at one end and forcinJ it out
the other to Jenerate thrust. A  device built  with  several thrusters pointed
alonJ  different  axes could  remain  in   one position,  or  indeed  naviJate
throuJh space.

       Each aerostat in the doJ pod Jrid was a mirror-surfaced, aerodynamic
teardrop Must wide enouJh, at its widest part, to have contained a PinJ-PonJ
ball. These pods were proJrammed to  hanJ in  space in a hexaJonal Jrid
pattern, about ten centimeters apart near the Jround (close enouJh to stop a
doJ but not a cat, hence “doJ pods”) and spaced wider as they Jot hiJher. ,n
this  fashion  a  hemispherical dome  was  limned   around the  sacrosanct
airspace of the New Atlantis Clave. When wind Justed, the pods all swunJ
into it like  weather vanes, and the Jrid deformed for a bit as the pods were
shoved around; but all of them eventually worked their way back into place,
swimminJ upstream like  minnows, propellinJ  the  air turbines. The 'bines
made a  thin   hissinJ  noise,  like  a  ra]or   blade  cuttinJ  air,  that,  when
multiplied   by  the  number  of   pods  within   earshot,  enJendered a  not
altoJether cheerful ambience.

       EnouJh wrestlinJ  with the wind,  and a pod's battery would run down.
Then it would  swim over and nu]]le   its neiJhbor. The two  would mate in
midair,  like   draJonflies,  and  the  weaker  would  take  power  from   the
stronJer. The  system included  larJer  aerostats called nurse  drones that
would  cruise  around dumpinJ   larJe  amounts of   power  into  randomly
selected pods all  over  the Jrid,   which  would  then distribute  it   to  their
neiJhbors. ,f a pod thouJht it was havinJ mechanical trouble, it would send
out a  messaJe, and a fresh pod  would  fly  out  from  the  Royal  Security
installation beneath Source Victoria and relieve it so that it could fly  home
to be decompiled.

       As numerous eiJht-year-old boys had discovered, you could not climb
the doJ pod Jrid because the pods didn't have enouJh thrust to support your
weiJht; your foot would Must mash the first pod into the Jround. ,t would try

65
to work  its way  loose, but if  it  were stuck  in mud  or its  turbines fouled,
another pod would have to come out and replace it. For the same reason you
could pluck any pod from its place and carry it away. When Hackworth had
performed this stunt as a  youth, he had discovered that  the farther it  Jot
from  its  appointed  place  the  hotter  it   became, all   the  while   politely
informinJ him,  in clipped military  diction, that he had best release it or fall
victim to  vaJuely adumbrated conseTuences. But nowadays you could Must
steal one or two whenever you felt like  it,  and a new one would come out
and replace it; once they fiJured  out they were no lonJer  part of the Jrid,
the pods would self-scramble and become instant souvenirs.

       This  user-friendly  approach did not  imply  that  Jrid-tamperinJ  went
iJnored, or that such activities were  approved of. You could walk  throuJh
the Jrid whenever you chose by shovinJ a few pods out of the way—unless
Royal Security had told the pods to electrocute you or blast you into chum.
,f so, they would politely warn you before doinJ it. Even when they were in
a more passive mode, thouJh, the aerostats were watchinJ and listeninJ, so
that nothinJ  Jot  throuJh  the doJ  pod  Jrid  without  becominJ  an instant
media celebrity  with   hundreds of  uniformed  fans  down  in  Royal  -oint
Forces Command.

       8nless  it  was  microscopic. Microscopic  invaders were  more of  the
threat nowadays. -ust to name one example, there was Red Death, a.k.a. the
Seven Minute  Special, a tiny  aerodynamic  capsule that burst open  after
impact  and  released a   thousand or   so  corpuscle-si]e   bodies,  known
colloTuially as cookie-cutters, into  the victim's  bloodstream. ,t took  about
seven minutes for all of the blood in  a typical person's body to recirculate,
so after  this  interval  the  cookie-cutters  would  be  randomly  distributed
throuJhout the victim's orJans and limbs.

       A  cookie-cutter was shaped like  an aspirin tablet except that the  top
and bottom were domed more to withstand ambient pressure; for like most
other nanotechnoloJical devices a cookie-cutter  was filled   with  vacuum.
,nside were  two  centrifuJes,  rotatinJ  on the  same axis  but  in  opposite
directions, preventinJ the  unit  from  actinJ like   a Jyroscope. The  device

66
could be triJJered in various ways;  the most primitive  were simple seven-
minute time bombs.

       Detonation dissolved the bonds holdinJ the centrifuJes toJether so that
each of a thousand or so ballisticules suddenly flew outward. The enclosinJ
shell shattered easily, and each ballisticule kicked up a shock wave, doinJ
surprisinJly  little  damaJe at first,  tracinJ  narrow  linear disturbances and
occasionally takinJ a chip out of  a bone. But soon they slowed to near the
speed of sound, where shock wave piled on top of shock wave to produce a
sonic boom.  Then all  the  damaJe happened at once. DependinJ  on the
initial speed of the centrifuJe, this  could happen at varyinJ distances from
the detonation point; most everythinJ inside the radius was undamaJed but
everythinJ  near it  was  pulped;  hence, “cookie-cutter.”  The  victim   then
made a loud noise like the crack of a whip, as a few fraJments exited his or
her flesh and dropped throuJh the  sound barrier in  air. Startled witnesses
would turn  Must in time to  see the victim  flushinJ  briJht  pink.  Bloodred
crescents would  suddenly appear  all  over  the  body;  these marked  the
Jeometric intersection of detonation surfaces with skin and were a boon to
forensic types, who  could  thereby  identify  the  type of  cookie-cutter  by
comparinJ the marks aJainst a handy pocket reference card. The victim was
Must a biJ leaky sack of undifferentiated Jore at this point  and, of  course,
never survived.

       Such inventions had spawned concern that people from Phyle A miJht
surreptitiously introduce  a few  million   lethal  devices into  the  bodies of
members of Phyle B, providinJ  the  technically sweetest possible twist on
the trite, ancient dream of beinJ able instantly to turn  a whole society into
Jravy. A few inroads of that kind had been made, a few mass closed-casket
funerals had been held, but not many. ,t was hard to control these devices. ,f
a person ate or drank one, it miJht end up in their body, but it miJht Must Jo
into the food  chain and Jet recycled into  the body of  someone you liked.
But the biJ  problem was the host's immune system, which caused enouJh
of a histoloJical fuss to tip off the intended victims.

       What worked  in the body could work  elsewhere, which is why phyles
had their  own  immune  systems now.  The impreJnable-shield  paradiJm

67
didn't work  at the nano level;  one needed to hack the  mean free path. A
well-defended clave was surrounded by an aerial buffer ]one infested with
immunocules—microscopic   aerostats  desiJned  to    seek  and   destroy
invaders. ,n the  case of Atlantis/ShanJhai this  ]one  was never shallower
than twenty kilometers. The innermost rinJ  was a Jreenbelt lyinJ  on both
sides of  the  doJ  pod  Jrid,   and the  outer  rinJ   was called  the  Leased
Territories.

       ,t   was always  foJJy   in  the  Leased Territories,  because all of   the
immunocules in the air served as nuclei for the condensation of water vapor.
,f you stared carefully into the foJ and focused on a point inches in front of
your  nose,   you   could  see  it    sparklinJ,   like   so   many  microscopic
searchliJhts, as the immunocules swept space with lidar beams. Lidar was
like radar except that it  used the smaller wavelenJths that happened to be
visible to the human eye. The sparklinJ  of tiny  liJhts  was the evidence of
microscopic dreadnouJhts huntinJ each other implacably throuJh  the foJ,
like 8-boats and destroyers in the black water of the North Atlantic.


                    Nell  sees something peculiar; Harv explains all.


One morninJ Nell looked out the window and saw the world had turned the
color of pencil lead. Cars, velocipedes, Tuadrupeds, even power-skaters left
towerinJ black vortices in their wakes.

       Harv came back from beinJ out all niJht. Nell  screamed when she saw
him because he was a charcoal wraith with two monstrous Jrowths on his
face. He peeled back a filter mask to reveal Jrayish-pink  skin underneath.
He showed her his white teeth and then took up couJhinJ.  He went about
this  methodically,  conMurinJ tanJles of  spun  phleJm  from   his  deepest
alveoli and proMectinJ them into the toilet. Now and then he would stop Must
to breathe, and a faint whistlinJ noise would come from his throat.

       Harv  did not explain himself  but went about workinJ  with  his thinJs.
He unscrewed the bulJes on his mask and took out black thinJs that kicked
up little black dust storms when he tossed them onto the floor. He replaced

68
them with a couple of  white  thinJs that he took  from a Nanobar wrapper,
thouJh by the time he was finished, the white thinJs were covered with his
black finJerprints,  the ridJes  and whorls  perfectly  resolved. He held  the
Nanobar wrapper up to the liJht for a moment.

       “Early  protocol,” he rasped, and pitched it toward the wastebasket.

       Then he held the mask up to Nell's face, Juided the straps around her
head, and tiJhtened them down. Her lonJ hair Jot cauJht in the buckles and
pinched, but her obMections were muffled by the mask. ,t took a little effort
to breathe now. The mask pressed aJainst her face when she inhaled and
whooshed when she exhaled.

       “Keep it  on,” Harv said. “,t'll  protect you from toner.”

       “What's  toner?” she mumbled. The words did not make it out throuJh
the mask, but Harv Juessed them from the look in her eyes.

       “Mites,”  he said, “or so they say down at the Flea Circus anyway.” He
picked up one of the black thinJs taken from the mask and flicked it with a
finJertip. A  cineritious cloud swirled  out of it,  like a drop of  ink in  a Jlass
of water, and hunJ swirlinJ in the air, neither risinJ  nor fallinJ.  Sparkles of
liJht flashed in the midst of it  like fairy  dust. “See, there's mites around, all
the time.  They  use the sparkles to  talk  to  each other,”  Harv  explained.
“They're in  the air, in  food  and water, everywhere. And there's rules that
these mites are supposed to follow,  and those rules  are called protocols.
And there's a protocol from way back that says they're supposed to be Jood
for your  lunJs.  They're supposed to break  down into  safe  pieces if  you
breathe one inside  of   you.”  Harv  paused at  this  point,   theatrically,  to
summon forth   one   more  ebon  looJie,   which   Nell   Juessed must  be
swimminJ with  safe mite bits. “But  there are people who break those rules
sometimes. Who don't follow the protocols. And , Juess if there's too many
mites in the air all breakinJ down inside your lunJs,  millions—well  maybe
those safe pieces aren't so safe if there's millions. But anyways, the Juys at
the Flea Circus say that sometimes the mites Jo to war with each other. Like
maybe someone in ShanJhai makes a mite that doesn't follow the protocol,

69
and Jets his matter compiler to makinJ a whole lot of them, and sends them
all across the water to New Atlantis Clave to snoop on the Vickys, or even
maybe  to  do   them  harm.  Then  some  Vicky—one   of   their   Protocol
Enforcement Juys—makes a mite to Jo  out and find  that mite and kill   it,
and they Jet into a war. That's what's happeninJ today, Nell. Mites fiJhtinJ
other mites. This dust—we call it  toner—is actually  the dead bodies of all
those mites.”

       “When  will  the war be over?” Nell asked, but Harv could not hear her,
havinJ entered into another couJhinJ MaJ.

       Eventually  Harv Jot  up and tied a strip  of white  Nanobar around his
face. The spot over his mouth immediately beJan turninJ Jray. He  eMected
used cartridJes from his mite Jun and inserted new ones. ,t was shaped like
a Jun, but it sucked air in instead of shootinJ thinJs out. You loaded it with
drum-shaped cartridJes filled   with   accordion-pleated paper.  When  you
turned it   on,  it   made a  little   whooshinJ  noise  as  it  sucked  air—and
hopefully mites—throuJh  the paper. The mites Jot  stuck in  there. “Gotta
Jo,” he said, JoosinJ the triJJer on the Jun a couple of times. “Never know
what ,   miJht  find.”   Then  he  headed for  the  exit,  leavinJ  black  toner
footprints  on  the  floor,  which  were  scoured  away  by  the  swirlinJ   air
currents in his wake, as if he had never passed that way.


                   Hackworth  compiles the Young Lady's Illustrated
                   Primer;  particulars  of the underlying  technology. 



Bespoke was a Victorian  house on a  hill,  a  block lonJ  and replete  with
winJs,  turrets,  atria,  and  bree]y   verandas. Hackworth  was  not  senior
enouJh to merit a turret or a balcony, but he did have a view into a Jarden
where Jardenia and boxwood Jrew. SittinJ at his desk, he could not see the
Jarden, but he could smell  it, especially when  the wind  blew in  from the
sea.

       Runcible was sittinJ on his desk in the form of  a stack of papers, most
of them siJned -OHN   PERC,VAL  HACKWORTH.  He  unfolded Cotton's

70
document. ,t  was  still  runninJ   the little   industrial  cartoon.  Cotton  had
clearly enMoyed himself. No one ever  Jot fired  for  JoinJ  with   enhanced
photorealism,  but   Hackworth's  own   siJnature   look   was  lifted    from
nineteenth-century patent applications:  black  on  white,   shades of  Jray
implied  with  nearly  microscopic  crosshatchinJ, old-fashioned letterpress
font a  little  rouJh  around the  edJes. ,t  drove clients  wild—they  always
wanted to blow up the diaJrams on their drawinJ-room mediatrons. Cotton
Jot   it.    He'd   done   his   diaJram   in    the   same  style,    and   so   his
nanotechnoloJical battery chuJJed away on the paJe lookinJ much like the
Jear train of an Edwardian dreadnouJht.

       Hackworth   put   Cotton's  document  atop  the   Runcible  stack  and
Juillotined it  aJainst the desktop a couple of times, superstitiously tryinJ to
make it  look  neat. He carried  it  to the  corner of  his office,  over  by  the
window, where a new piece of furniture  had recently been rolled in by the
porter: a cherrywood cabinet on brass casters. ,t came up to his waist. On
top was a polished brass mechanism—an automatic document reader with
detachable tray. A   small  door in   the  back betrayed  a Feed  port,  one-
centimeter, typical of household appliances but startlinJly wimpy in a heavy
industrial works,  especially considerinJ that this  cabinet contained one of
the most powerful computers on earth—five  cc's of  Bespoke rod loJic.  ,t
used about a hundred thousand watts of  power, which  came in  over  the
superconductinJ part of the Feed. The power had to be dissipated, or else
the computer would incinerate itself and most of  the buildinJ  too. GettinJ
rid of  that enerJy had been much more of an enJineerinJ Mob than the rod
loJic. The latest Feed protocol had a solution built  in: a device could  now
pull ice  off  the Feed, one microscopic chunk at  a time, and output  warm
water.

       Hackworth  put the stack of  documents into the feed  tray on top  and
told the machine to compile Runcible.  There was a card-shufflinJ bu]]   as
the reader Jrabbed the edJe of  each paJe momentarily  and extracted its
contents. The flexible Feed line, which  ran from the wall  into  the back of
the cabinet,  Merked and stiffened orJasmically  as the  computer's works
sucked in a tremendous Molt of hypersonic ice and shot back warm water. A
fresh sheet of paper appeared in the cabinet's output tray.

71
       The   top  of   the   document  read,  “R8NC,BLE     VERS,ON   1.0—
COMP,LED SPEC,F,CAT,ON.”

       The  only  other  thinJ  on  the  document was  a  picture  of  the final
product, nicely rendered in Hackworth's siJnature pseudo-enJraved style. ,t
looked exactly like a book.

       On his  way down the vast helical stair in  the larJest and most central
of Bespoke's atria, Hackworth pondered his upcominJ crime. ,t was entirely
too late to Jo back now. ,t flustered him that he had unconsciously made up
his mind months aJo without markinJ the occasion.

       ThouJh Bespoke was a desiJn rather than a production house, it had its
own matter  compilers, includinJ   a couple  of fairly   biJ  ones, a  hundred
cubic meters. Hackworth had reserved a more modest desktop model, one-
tenth of  a cubic  meter. 8se  of  these compilers had to  be  loJJed, so  he
identified himself and the proMect first. Then the machine accepted the edJe
of the document. Hackworth told the matter compiler to beJin immediately,
and then  looked  throuJh  a  transparent wall  of  solid  diamond  into  the
eutactic environment.

       The universe was a disorderly mess, the only interestinJ bits beinJ the
orJani]ed anomalies. Hackworth had once taken his family  out rowinJ  on
the pond in  the park,  and the ends of  the yellow  oars spun  off  compact
vortices, and Fiona, who had tauJht herself the physics of  liTuids throuJh
numerous experimental beveraJe spills and in  the  bathtub, demanded an
explanation  for  these  holes  in   water.  She  leaned  over  the  Junwale,
Gwendolyn holdinJ  the sash of her dress, and felt those vortices with  her
hands, wantinJ to understand them. The rest of the pond, simply water in no
particular order, was uninterestinJ.

       We iJnore the blackness of outer space and pay attention to the stars,
especially if they seem to order themselves into constellations. “Common as
the air” meant somethinJ worthless, but Hackworth knew that every breath
of air that Fiona drew, lyinJ  in  her little  bed at niJht, Must a silver Jlow in
the moonliJht, was used by her body to make skin and hair and bones. The

72
air  became Fiona,   and  deservinJ—no,  demandinJ—of  love.   OrderinJ
matter was the  sole endeavor of  Life,  whether  it  was a  Mumble of self-
replicatinJ molecules in the primordial  ocean, or a steam-powered EnJlish
mill  turninJ weeds into clothinJ,  or Fiona lyinJ  in  her bed turninJ air into
Fiona.

       A  leaf  of  paper was about a  hundred thousand nanometers thick; a
third of a million  atoms could fit  into this span. Smart paper consisted of a
network  of  infinitesimal   computers sandwiched between mediatrons.  A
mediatron was a thinJ that could chanJe its color from  place to place; two
of them accounted for about two-thirds of the paper's thickness, leavinJ an
internal Jap wide  enouJh to contain structures a hundred thousand atoms
wide.

       LiJht  and air  could easily  penetrate to this point,  so the works were
contained within   vacuoles—airless buckminsterfullerene  shells  overlaid
with a reflective  aluminum layer so that they would  not implode en masse
whenever the paJe was exposed to sunliJht. The interiors of the buckyballs,
then, constituted somethinJ close to a eutactic environment.  Here resided
the rod loJic that made the paper smart. Each of these spherical computers
was linked  to  its  four  neiJhbors,  north-east-south-west, by a  bundle of
flexible pushrods runninJ down a flexible, evacuated buckytube, so that the
paJe as a whole constituted a parallel computer made up of about a billion
separate processors. The individual processors weren't especially smart or
fast and were  so susceptible to  the elements that typically   only  a small
fraction of  them were workinJ,  but  even with  those limitations the  smart
paper still constituted, amonJ other thinJs, a powerful Jraphical computer.

       And  still,   Hackworth  reflected, it   had nothinJ  on  Runcible,  whose
paJes were thicker and more densely packed with computational machinery,
each sheet folded   four  times  into   a  sixteen-paJe siJnature,  thirty-two
siJnatures brouJht toJether in a spine that, in addition to keepinJ the book
from  fallinJ   apart,  functioned   as an  enormous  switchinJ   system  and
database.

73
       ,t  was made to  be robust, but  it  still  had to  be born  in the  eutactic
womb, a solid  diamond vacuum chamber housinJ a start matter compiler.
The diamond was doped with somethinJ that let only red liJht pass throuJh;
standard enJineerinJ practice  eschewed any molecular  bonds  that were
tenuous enouJh to be broken by those la]y red photons, underachievers of
the visible spectrum. Thus the Jrowth of your prototype was visible throuJh
the window—a Jood last-ditch safety measure. ,f your code was buJJy and
your proMect Jrew too larJe, threateninJ to shatter the walls of the chamber,
you could  always shut it  down via  the ludicrously  low-tech  expedient of
shuttinJ off the Feed line.

       Hackworth wasn't worried, but he watched the initial phases of Jrowth
anyway, Must because it was always interestinJ. ,n the  beJinninJ was  an
empty chamber, a diamond hemisphere, JlowinJ with dim red liJht.  ,n  the
center of the floor  slab, one could  see a naked cross-section of an eiJht-
centimeter Feed, a  central  vacuum  pipe surrounded  by  a  collection  of
smaller  lines,  each  a  bundle  of   microscopic  conveyor  belts  carryinJ
nanomechanical buildinJ   blocks—individual   atoms, or   scores of   them
linked toJether in handy modules.

       The matter compiler was a machine that sat at the terminus of a Feed
and, followinJ  a proJram, plucked molecules from the conveyors one at a
time and assembled them into more complicated structures.

       Hackworth  was the  proJrammer. Runcible was  the proJram.  ,t  was
made up of  a  number of  subproJrams, each of  which  had resided on  a
separate piece of  paper until   a few  minutes  aJo,  when the  immensely
powerful computer in Hackworth's  office had compiled them  into a sinJle
finished  proJram written   in  a  lanJuaJe that  the  matter compiler  could
understand.

       A  transparent ha]e coalesced across the terminus of the Feed, mold on
an overripe strawberry. The  ha]e thickened  and beJan adoptinJ a  shape,
some parts a little hiJher than others. ,t spread across the floor away from
the Feed line until  it  had filled  out  its footprint:  one Tuadrant of  a circle

74
with a radius of a do]en centimeters. Hackworth continued to watch until he
was sure he could see the top edJe of the book JrowinJ out of it.

       ,n  the corner of this  lab stood an evolved version of  a copy machine
that  could   take   Must about  any   kind   of   recorded   information   and
transmoJrify  it   into  somethinJ  else. ,t   could  even  destroy a  piece  of
information and then attest to the fact that it had been destroyed, which was
useful in the relatively paranoid environment of  Bespoke. Hackworth Jave
it the  document containinJ the compiled  Runcible code and  destroyed it.
Provably.

       When it  was finished,  Hackworth released the vacuum and lifted the
red diamond dome. The finished  book stood upriJht  atop the system that
had extruded it,  which   was turned  into  a Munk heap as soon as  it  was
touched by the air. Hackworth picked up the book in his riJht hand and the
extruder in his left, and tossed the latter into a Munk bin.

       He locked the book in a desk drawer, picked up his top hat, Jloves, and
walkinJ-stick,  stepped  into  his  walker,  and  set  off  for   the  Causeway.
Toward ShanJhai.


                            Nell &  Harv's general living  situation;
                                  the Leased Territories; Tequila. 



China was riJht across the water, and you could see it if you went down to
the beach. The city there, the one with skyscrapers, was called PudonJ, and
beyond that was ShanJhai. Harv went there with his friends sometimes. He
said it was biJJer than you could imaJine, old and dirty  and full of  stranJe
people and siJhts.

       They lived  in the L.T.,  which accordinJ to Harv  was short for Leased
Territories in letters. Nell  already knew the mediaJlyphics for it.  Harv had
also tauJht  her  the siJn  for  Enchantment,  which  was the  name of  the
Territory where they lived; it  was a princess sprinklinJ Jolden specks from
a stick onto  some Jray houses, which turned yellow  and briJht  when the

75
specks touched them. Nell  thouJht that  the specks were mites, but  Harv
insisted that mites were too  small to  be seen, that the stick  was a maJic
wand and the specks were fairy dust. ,n any case, Harv made her remember
that mediaJlyph so that if she ever Jot lost, she could find her way home.

       “But  it's better if  you Must call me,” Harv said, “and ,'ll come and find
you.”

       “Why?”

       “Because there's bad people out there, and you shouldn't walk throuJh
the L.T. alone, ever.”

       “What  bad people?”

       Harv looked troubled, heaved multiple siJhs, fidJeted. “You know that
ractive , was in the other day, where there were pirates, and they tied up the
kids and were JoinJ to make them walk the plank?”

       “Yeah.”

       “There are pirates in the L.T. too.”

       “Where?”

       “Don't  bother lookinJ.  You can't see 'em. They don't look like pirates,
with the biJ hats and swords and all. They Must look like normal people. But
they're pirates on the inside, and they like to Jrab kids and tie 'em up.”

       “And  make them walk the plank?”

       “SomethinJ like  that.”

       “Call  the police!”

       “,  don't think the police would help. Maybe they would.”

76
       Police were Chinese. They came across the Causeway from ShanJhai.
Nell  saw them up  close once,  when they  came into  the house to  arrest
Mom's boyfriend RoJ.  RoJ wasn't home, Must Nell and Harv were, and so
Harv let  them in  and let  them sit  in the  livinJ  room  and fetched tea for
them. Harv spoke some words of ShanJhainese to them, and they Jrinned
and ruffled his hair. He told Nell to stay in their bedroom and not come out,
but Nell came out anyway and peeked. There were three policemen, two in
uniforms and one in  a suit, and they sat smokinJ  ciJarettes and watchinJ
somethinJ on  the  mediatron  until   RoJ  came back.  Then  they  had  an
arJument with him  and took him  out, shoutinJ the whole  way. After  that,
RoJ didn't come around anymore, and TeTuila started JoinJ out with Mark.

       8nlike   RoJ, Mark  had a  Mob. He worked in the New Atlantis  Clave
cleaninJ windows of  the Vickys' homes. He would  come home late in the
afternoon all  tired  and dirty  and  take a  lonJ  shower in  their  bathroom.
Sometimes he would have Nell come into the bathroom with him and help
scrub his back,  because he couldn't Tuite  reach one spot  in the  middle.
Sometimes he would look at Nell's hair and tell her that she needed a bath,
and then she would take off her clothes and climb into the shower with him
and he would help wash her.

       One day she asked Harv whether Mark ever Jave him a shower. Harv
Jot upset and asked her a lot of Tuestions. Later, Harv told TeTuila about it,
but TeTuila had an arJument with him  and sent him to his  room with  one
side of his face red and puffy. Then TeTuila talked to Mark. They arJued in
the livinJ  room,  the thumps boominJ  throuJh the  wall as Harv  and Nell
huddled toJether in Harv's bed.

       Harv  and Nell both pretended to Jo to sleep that niJht, but Nell heard
Harv JettinJ  up and sneakinJ out of the house. She didn't see him for  the
rest of the niJht. ,n  the morninJ, Mark  Jot up and went to  work, and then
TeTuila Jot up and put a lot of makeup all over her face and went to work.

       Nell  was alone the whole day, wonderinJ if  Mark was JoinJ  to make
her take a shower that eveninJ. She knew from the way  Harv had reacted
that the showers were a bad thinJ, and in  a way it  felt Jood  to know  this

77
because it explained why it felt wronJ. She did not know how to stop Mark
from makinJ  her take the  shower this eveninJ. She told  Dinosaur, Duck,
Peter, and Purple about it.

       These four creatures were the only  animals that had survived a Jreat
massacre perpetrated durinJ the  previous  year  by  Mac,  one of   Mom's
boyfriends, who in a fit  of raJe had Jathered up all of the dolls and stuffed
animals in Nell's room and stuffed them into the knackinJ hatch.

       When Harv had opened it up a few hours later, he had found all of the
toys vanished except for  these four. He  had explained  that the deke  bin
would only work on thinJs that had come from the M.C. oriJinally, and that
anythinJ that had been made “by hand” (a troublesome concept to explain)
was reMected. Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple were old raJJed thinJs that
had been made “by hand.”

       When Nell  told  them her story, Dinosaur was brave and said that she
should fiJht Mark. Duck  had some ideas, but they were silly ideas, because
Duck  was Must a little  kid.   Peter thouJht  she should  run  away. Purple
thouJht she should use maJic and sprinkle Mark with fairy dust; some of it
would be like the mites that (accordinJ to Harv) the Vickys  used to protect
themselves from bad people.

       ,n the kitchen was some food that TeTuila had brouJht home last niJht,
includinJ  chopsticks with little   mediatrons built into  their handles so that
mediaJlyphics ran up and down them while  you ate. Nell  knew that there
must be mites in there, to make those mediaJlyphics, and so she took one of
the chopsticks as her maJic wand.

       She also had a silvery  plastic balloon  that Harv had made her in  the
M.C. All   the air  had Jone out  of it.  She reckoned it  would  make a nice
shield like  she had  once seen on the  arm  of  a kniJht  in  one  of  Harv's
ractives. She sat in the corner of  the room on her mattress with  Dinosaur
and Purple in  front  of  her, and Duck  and  Peter behind her, and  waited,
clutchinJ her maJic wand and her shield.

78
       But  Mark didn't come home. TeTuila came home and wondered where
Mark was, but didn't seem to mind that he wasn't there. Finally Harv came
back, late that niJht, after  Nell had Jone to  bed, and hid somethinJ under
his mattress. The next day Nell looked: ,t  was a pair of heavy sticks, each
about a foot lonJ, Moined in the middle by a short chain, and the whole thinJ
was smeared with reddish-brown stuff that had Jone sticky and crusty.

       The next time Nell  saw Harv, he told her that Mark was never cominJ
back, that he  was one of  the  pirates he'd warned  her about, and  that if
anyone else ever tried to do  such thinJs to her, she should run  away and
scream and tell Harv and his friends  riJht away. Nell  was astonished; she
had not understood Must how tricky pirates were until this moment.


                            Hackworth  crosses the Causeway into
                                       Shanghai;  ruminations. 



The Causeway MoininJ New Chusan and the PudonJ Economic =one was
Atlantis/ShanJhai's whole reason for existence, beinJ in fact a titanic Feed
restrained by mountainous thrust bearinJs at each end. From the standpoint
of mass&cash flow, the physical territory  of  New Chusan itself, a  lunJ of
smart coral  respirinJ  in  the  ocean, was  nothinJ  more  or  less than  the
fountainhead of  China's  consumer economy, its  only   function  to  spew
meJatons of  nanostuff  into  the Middle   KinJdom's  ever-ramifyinJ   Feed
network, reachinJ millions of new peasants every month.

       For most of  its lenJth  the Causeway skimmed the hiJh tide level, but
the middle  kilometer arched to  let  ships throuJh;  not  that anyone really
needed ships anymore, but a few recalcitrant swabbies and some creative
tour operators were still plyinJ  the YanJt]e estuary in Munks, which looked
precious underneath the  catenary arch  of  the  biJ  Feed, strumminJ  the
ancient-meets-modern chord for   adherents of  the  National  Geographic
worldview.  As   Hackworth   reached the  apoJee,  he  could   see similar
Causeways to port and  starboard, linkinJ  the outskirts  of  ShanJhai with
other artificial   islands. Nippon  Nano  looked  FuMiesTue, a belt of office
buildinJs around the waterline, houses above that, the hiJher the better, then

79
a belt of  Jolf  courses, the whole  top third  reserved for  Jardens, bamboo
Jroves, and other forms of micromanaJed Nature. ,n the other direction was
a little  bit  of  Hindustan. The  Jeotecture of their  island  owed less to  the
MoJul  period  than  to  the  Soviet,  no  effort   beinJ  made to   shroud its
industrial heart in fractal artifice.  ,t  sTuatted out there some ten kilometers
from New  Chusan, sabotaJinJ many expensive views  and servinJ as the
butt of snotty woJ Mokes. Hackworth never Moined in these Mokes because he
was better informed  than  most and knew  that  the Hindustanis  stood an
excellent chance of stompinJ all over  the Victorians and the Nipponese in
the competition  for China.  They were  Must as smart, there were more of
them, and they understood the peasant thinJ.

       From the hiJh  point of the arch, Hackworth  could look across the flat
territory of  outer PudonJ and into  the hiJh-rise  district  of metropolis.  He
was struck,  as ever,  by  the sheer  clunkiness of  old  cities,  the  acreaJe
sacrificed, over the  centuries, to various stabs at the  problem of  MovinJ
Stuff  Around.  HiJhways,  bridJes,  railways,  and  their  attendant smoky,
JlintinJ  yards, power lines, pipelines, port facilities  ranJinJ from  sampan-
and-Munk to stevedore-and-carJo-net to containership, airports. Hackworth
had enMoyed San Francisco and was  hardly  immune  to  its  charm,  but
Atlantis/ShanJhai had imbued him with  the sense that all the old  cities of
the world were doomed, except possibly as theme parks, and that the future
was in the new cities, built  from  the bedrock up one atom at a time,  their
Feed lines as inteJral as capillaries were to flesh. The old neiJhborhoods of
ShanJhai, Feedless or with overhead Feeds kludJed in  on  bamboo stilts,
seemed friJhteninJly inert, like an opium addict sTuattinJ in the middle of a
frenetic downtown street, blowinJ  a reed of sweet smoke out between his
teeth, starinJ into some ancient dream that all the bustlinJ pedestrians had
banished to unfreTuented parts of their minds. Hackworth was headinJ for
one of those neiJhborhoods riJht now, as fast as he could
walk. 

       ,f  you counterfeited directly from a Feed, it would be noticed sooner or
later, because all matter compilers fed information back to the Source. You
needed your very own private Source, disconnected from the Feed network,
and this was a difficult thinJ  to make. But a motivated counterfeiter could,

80
with  some  inJenuity   and  patience, put   toJether  a  Source capable  of
providinJ an assortment of simple buildinJ  blocks in  the ranJe of ten to  a
hundred daltons. There were a lot  of  people like  that in  ShanJhai, some
more patient and inJenious than others.


                                 Hackworth in  the hong of Dr. X.


The scalpel's edJe was exactly one atom wide; it  delaminated the skin of
Hackworth's palm like  an  airfoil  JlidinJ  throuJh  smoke. He peeled off  a
strip the si]e of  a nailhead and proffered it to  Dr. ;,   who snatched it with
ivory chopsticks, dredJed it throuJh an exTuisite cloisonné bowl filled with
chemical  dessicant, and  arranJed it   on  a  small  windowpane  of   solid
diamond.

       Dr.  ;'s   real  name was a seTuence of shushinJ noises, disembodied
metallic bu]]es,  unearthly Tuasi-Germanic vowels, and half-swallowed R's,
invariably  manJled   by  Westerners. Possibly   for   political   reasons, he
preferred not  to  pick  a  fake  Western name  like  many  Asians,  instead
suJJestinJ, in a vaJuely patroni]inJ  way, that they should Must be satisfied
with callinJ  him Dr.  ;—that   letter beinJ the first  in the Pinyin  spellinJ of
his name.

       Dr.  ;   placed the diamond slide into a stainless-steel cylinder. At  one
end was a Teflon-Jasketed flanJe riddled with bolt-holes. Dr. ; handed it to
one of his assistants, who carried it with both hands, as if it were a Jolden
eJJ on a silken  pillow,  and mated it with  another flanJe  on a network of
massive stainless-steel plumbinJ that covered most of two  tabletops. The
assistant's assistant Jot the Mob of insertinJ all the shiny bolts and torTue-
wrenchinJ them  down.  Then the assistant flicked  a  switch,  and an old-
fashioned vacuum pump whacked into life, makinJ conversation impossible
for a  minute or  two.  DurinJ  this time  Hackworth  looked around Dr.  ;'s
laboratory, tryinJ to peJ the century and in some cases even the dynasty of
each item. A  row  of  mason Mars stood on a hiJh shelf,  filled  with  what
looked like Jiblets floatinJ in  urine. Hackworth supposed that they were the
Jall  bladders of   now-extinct  species, no   doubt  accruinJ  value  by  the

81
moment, better than any mutual fund. A locked Jun cabinet and a primæval
Macintosh  desktop-publishinJ  system, Jreen  with   aJe,  attested to   the
owner's previous forays into  officially   discouraJed realms of behavior. A
window had been cut into  one wall, betrayinJ  an airshaft no larJer than a
Jrave, from the bottom of which Jrew a Jnarled maple. Other than that, the
room was packed with   so many small,  numerous, brown,  wrinkled,  and
orJanic-lookinJ obMects that Hackworth's eyes lost the ability to distinJuish
one from the next. There were also some samples of calliJraphy  danJlinJ
here and there, probably snatches of poetry. Hackworth had made efforts to
learn a few Chinese characters and to acTuaint himself with some basics of
their intellectual  system, but in Jeneral, he liked  his  transcendence out in
plain siJht where he could  keep an eye on it—say, in  a nice stained-Jlass
window—not woven  throuJh the fabric of  life  like  Jold threads throuJh a
brocade.

       Everyone in  the  room could  tell  by  its sound  when the mechanical
pump was finished with its  leJ of  the relay. The vapor pressure of its own
oil had been reached. The assistant closed a valve that isolated it from the
rest of the system, and then they switched over  to the nanopumps, which
made no noise at all. They were turbines, Must like the ones in Met enJines
but very small and lots of them. CastinJ a critical eye over Dr. ;'s   vacuum
plumbinJ, Hackworth could see that they also had a scavenJer, which was a
cylinder about the si]e  of  a child's head, wrinkled  up on the inside  into a
preposterous surface area coated with nanodevices Jood at latchinJ  onto
stray molecules. Between the nanopumps and the scavenJer, the vacuum
rapidly  dropped to  what  you  miJht  expect to  see halfway  between the
Milky  Way and Andromeda Jalaxies. Then Dr. ;   himself  Tuivered up out
of  his   chair  and   beJan  shufflinJ   around  the  room,   powerinJ   up  a
Jallimaufry of contraband technoloJy.

       This eTuipment came from diverse technoloJical epochs and had been
smuJJled into this, the Outer KinJdom, from a variety of sources, but all of
it  contributed  to  the same purpose:  ,t  surveyed  the microscopic  world
throuJh  ;-ray     diffraction,   electron  microscopy,  and   direct  nanoscale
probinJ, and synthesi]ed all of the resultinJ information into a sinJle three-
dimensional view.

82
       ,f   Hackworth  had  been doinJ  this   at work,   he  would  already  be
finished, but Dr. ;'s   system was a sort of Polish  democracy reTuirinJ full
consent of all participants, elicited one subsystem at a time. Dr. ;   and his
assistants would Jather around whichever  subsystem was believed to  be
farthest out of line  and shout at each other in  a mixture of  ShanJhainese,
Mandarin,  and  technical  EnJlish   for  a   while.  Therapies  administered
included but were not limited  to: turninJ thinJs  off, then on aJain; pickinJ
them up a couple of inches and then droppinJ them; turninJ off nonessential
appliances in  this and  other rooms;  removinJ  lids  and  wiJJlinJ   circuit
boards; extractinJ small contaminants, such as insects and their eJJ cases,
with  nonconductinJ chopsticks;  cable-wiJJlinJ;   incense-burninJ; puttinJ
folded-up pieces of   paper beneath table leJs;  drinkinJ   tea and sulkinJ;
invokinJ  unseen powers; sendinJ  runners to  other  rooms, buildinJs,   or
precincts with exTuisitely calliJraphed notes and waitinJ for  them to come
back carryinJ   spare parts  in   dusty, yellowed   cardboard boxes;  and  a
similarly   diverse  suite  of  troubleshootinJ   techniTues in   the  realm  of
software. Much of this  performance seemed to be Jenuine, the rest merely
for  Hackworth's  consumption, presumably layinJ   the Jroundwork   for  a
reneJotiation of the deal.

       Eventually  they were lookinJ  at the severed portion of  -ohn Percival
Hackworth on  a  meter-wide sheet of  mediatronic  paper that  one of  the
assistants had, with Jreat ceremony, unfurled across a low,  black lacTuer
table. They souJht somethinJ that was bulky by nanotech standards, so the
maJnification was not very hiJh—even so, the surface of Hackworth's skin
looked like  a  table  heaped with  crumpled newspapers. ,f  Dr.  ;    shared
Hackworth's Tueasiness, he didn't show it. He appeared to be sittinJ  with
hands folded in the lap of his embroidered silk robe, but Hackworth leaned
forward a bit  and saw his yellowed, inch-lonJ  finJernails overhanJinJ  the
black Swiss cross of an old Nintendo pad. The finJers moved, the imaJe on
the mediatron ]oomed forward. SomethinJ smooth and inorJanic unfolded
at  the  top  of   their  field   of   view:  some  kind   of  remotely  controlled
manipulator. 8nder  Dr. ;'s   direction  it  beJan to sift  throuJh  the heap of
desiccated skin.

83
       They  found a lot  of  mites, of course, both natural and artificial.   The
natural ones looked  like  little  crabs and had  been Tuietly inhabitinJ   the
outer layers of other creatures' bodies for hundreds of millions of years. The
artificial ones had all been developed in the past few decades. Most of them
consisted of a spherical or  ellipsoidal  hull  with  various attachments. The
hull was  a vacuole, a  wee bit  of  the eutactic environment  to coddle  the
mite's  machine-phase  innards.  The   hull's   diamondoid   structure   was
protected from the liJht by  a thin layer  of aluminum that made mites look
like miniature spaceships—only with the air on the outside and the vacuum
inside.

       Attached to the hulls  were various bits of Jear: manipulators, sensors,
locomotion systems, and antennas. The antennas were not at all  like  the
ones on an insect—they were usually flat patches studded with what looked
like  close-cropped fu]]—phased-array   systems for   sweepinJ  beams of
visible liJht   throuJh the air.  Most  of the  mites were also clearly  marked
with the  manufacturer's name and a part number;  this was demanded by
Protocol. A  few of  them were unmarked. These were illicit  and had been
invented either  by  people  like   Dr.  ;;    by  outlaw  phyles  who  spurned
Protocol; or by the covert labs that most people assumed were run by all the
]aibatsus.

       DurinJ   half   an  hour's  rootinJ   around  throuJh  Hackworth's  skin,
roaminJ around an area perhaps a millimeter on a side, they observed a few
do]en artificial  mites, not an unusual number nowadays. Almost all of them
were busted. Mites   didn't  last  very  lonJ  because they  were  small  but
complicated, which left little  space for redundant systems. As soon as one
Jot hit  with  a  cosmic ray,  it  died. They  also had little  space for  enerJy
storaJe, so many  of  them  simply  ran out  of  Muice after a  while.  Their
manufacturers compensated for this by makinJ a lot of them.

       Nearly all  of the mites were connected in some way with the Victorian
immune system, and of these, most were immunocules whose Mob was to
drift around the dirty  littoral of  New Chusan usinJ lidar to home in on any
other mites  that  miJht   disobey  Protocol.  FindinJ  one,  they  killed   the
invader by JrabbinJ onto  it and not  lettinJ Jo.  The Victorian  system used

84
Darwinian  techniTues to create killers  adapted to  their  prey, which  was
eleJant and effective but led to the creation of killers  that were simply too
bi]arre  to have been thouJht  up by  humans, Must as humans desiJninJ a
world never would have thouJht up the naked mole rat. Dr. ; took time out
to ]oom in  on an especially freakish killer locked in a death-Jrip around an
unlabeled mite. This did  not necessarily mean that Hackworth's flesh had
been invaded, rather that the dead mites had become part of the dust on a
table somewhere and been Jround into his skin when he touched it.

       To illustrate the kind  of mite he was presently lookinJ for,  Hackworth
had brouJht alonJ  a cocklebur that  he had teased from Fiona's hair  after
they had Jone for a walk  in the park.  He had shown it to  Dr. ;,   who  had
understood immediately, and eventually he found it.  ,t  looked completely
different from all  the other mites, because, as a cocklebur, its sole Mob was
to stick  to  whatever touched it  first.  ,t  had  been Jenerated a few  hours
previously   by   the   matter   compiler    at   Bespoke,   which,   followinJ
Hackworth's instructions, had placed  a few  million  of  them on  the outer
surface of  the ,llustrated  Primer. Many   of  them had been  embedded in
Hackworth's flesh when he had first picked the book up.

       Many  remained on the  book, back at  the office,  but Hackworth  had
anticipated that.  He  made it   explicit  now,  Must so Dr.  ;   and  his  staff
wouldn't Jet any ideas: “The cocklebur has an internal timer,” he said, “that
will  cause it to disinteJrate twelve hours after it was compiled. We have six
hours left in which to extract the information. ,t's encrypted, of course.”

       Dr. ;   smiled for the first time all day.

         

Dr. ;   was the ideal man for this Mob because of his very disreputability. He
was a  reverse  enJineer. He   collected  artificial   mites  like   some batty
Victorian lepidopterist. He  took them apart one atom at a time to see how
they worked, and when he found  some clever innovation, he sTuirreled it
away in  his database. Since most of these innovations were the  result of

85
natural selection, Dr. ;   was usually  the first  human beinJ to know  about
them.

       Hackworth  was a forJer,  Dr.  ;   was a honer. The  distinction  was at
least as old as the diJital computer. ForJers created a new technoloJy and
then forJed on to the next proMect, havinJ explored only the outlines of its
potential.  Honers  Jot   less respect  because they   appeared to  sit   still
technoloJically, playinJ   around with   systems that were  no lonJer  start,
hackinJ them for all they were worth,  JettinJ them to do thinJs the forJers
had never envisioned.

       Dr.   ;    selected a  pair   of   detachable manipulator  arms  from   his
unusually larJe arsenal. Some of these had been copied from New Atlantan,
Nipponese, or Hindustani desiJns and looked familiar to Hackworth; others,
however, were bi]arre  naturalistic devices that  seemed to have been torn
loose from  New  Atlantan  immunocules—evolved structures, rather  than
desiJned. The Doctor employed two of these arms to Jrip the cocklebur. ,t
was an aluminum-covered meJabuckyball in  a sunburst of barbed spines,
several of which were decorated with fraJments of shishkebabed skin.

       8nder  Hackworth's  direction  he rotated  the cocklebur  until  a small
spine-free patch came  into  view.  A  circular  depression, marked with   a
reJular pattern of holes and knobs, was set into the surface of the ball, like a
dockinJ port on the side of a spacecraft. ,nscribed around the circumference
of this fittinJ  was his maker's mark: ,OANN, HACV,RT8S  FEC,T.

       Dr. ;   did not need an explanation. ,t was a standard port. He probably
had half a do]en  manipulator arms desiJned to  mate with  it. He  selected
one  and  maneuvered its   tip   into   place,  then  spoke  a   command  in
ShanJhainese.

       Then he pulled the riJ off  his head and watched his assistant pour him
another cup of tea. “How lonJ?” he said.

       “About   a terabyte,” Hackworth  said. This  was a measure of storaJe
capacity, not of time, but he knew that Dr. ;  was the sort who could fiJure
it out.

86
       The ball  contained a machine-phase tape drive system, eiJht reels of
tape riJJed in parallel,  each with its  own read/write machinery. The tapes
themselves were polymer chains with different side Jroups representinJ the
loJical ones and ]eroes. ,t was a standard component, and so Dr. ; already
knew that when it was told to dump, it would spew out about a billion bytes
a second. Hackworth had Must told him that the total stored on the tapes was
a trillion    bytes, so  they  had  a thousand  seconds to  wait.  Dr.  ;    took
advantaJe of the time to leave the room, supported by assistants, and tend to
some of  the  other parallel  threads of  his  enterprise, which  was  known
informally as the Flea Circus.


                 Hackworth  departs from Dr. X's laboratory;  further
                         ruminations;  poem from Finkle-McGraw; 
                                       encounter with ruffians. 



Dr. ;'s   assistant swunJ the door  open and nodded insolently. Hackworth
swunJ his top hat into place and stepped out of the Flea Circus, blinkinJ at
the reek of China: smoky like the dreJs of a hundred million pots of lapsanJ
souchonJ, minJled   with   the  sweet  earthy  smell  of  pork   fat  and  the
brimstony tanJ of  plucked chickens and hot Jarlic. He  felt his  way across
the cobbles with the tip of  his walkinJ-stick  until his  eyes beJan to adMust.
He was now poorer by several thousand ucus. A si]able investment, but the
best a father could make.

       Dr.  ;'s   neiJhborhood was in the MinJ   Dynasty heart of  ShanJhai, a
warren of tiny  brick  structures sheathed in Jray stucco, topped with  tiled
roofs, freTuently surrounded by stucco walls. ,ron poles proMected from the
second-story windows for dryinJ  clothes, so that in  the narrow streets the
buildinJs appeared to be fencinJ with  each other. This neiJhborhood was
near the foundation of  the ancient city  wall,  built  to keep out  acTuisitive
Nipponese ronin, which had been torn down and made into a rinJ road.

       ,t  was part  of  the Outer  KinJdom,  which  meant that foreiJn  devils
were allowed, as lonJ as they were escorted by Chinese. Beyond it, deeper
into the old neiJhborhood, was supposedly a scrap of the Middle KinJdom

87
proper—the Celestial KinJdom, or C.K.,  as they liked to call it—where  no
foreiJners at all were allowed.

       An  assistant took Hackworth  as far as the  border, where he stepped
into  the  Chinese  Coastal  Republic,  an  entirely   different  country   that
comprised, amonJ many other  thinJs, virtually   all  of  ShanJhai. As if  to
emphasi]e this, younJ men loitered on corners in Western clothes, listeninJ
to loud music, hootinJ at women, and Jenerally iJnorinJ their filial duties.

       He  could have  taken an auto-rickshaw, which  was the  only  vehicle
other than  a bicycle  or  skateboard narrow  enouJh to  neJotiate  the  old
streets. But you never could tell what kind of surveillance miJht be present
in a ShanJhai taxi.  The departure of  a New  Atlantis  Jentleman from  the
Flea Circus  late  at  niJht  could  only  stimulate  the  imaJinations  of  the
Jendarmes, who had intimidated the criminal element to such a deJree that
they were now  feelinJ  restless and lookinJ  for  ways to  diversify. SaJes,
seers, and theoretical  physicists  could  only   speculate at  what,  if   any,
relationship  miJht    exist   between  the   ShanJhai  Police   Department's
astonishinJ scope of activities and actual law enforcement.

       Deplorable,  but  Hackworth  was thankful   for  it  as  he sampled  the
French Settlement's ramified  backstreets. A   handful  of  fiJures  skulked
across an intersection several blocks away, bloody liJht from  a mediatron
JlancinJ off  their patchwork Nanobar outfits,  the kind of  thinJ  only street
criminals would need to wear. Hackworth comforted  himself by  reasoninJ
that this must be a JanJ  from  one of the Leased Territories who  had Must
come over the Causeway. They wouldn't possibly be so rash as to assault a
Jentleman in the street, not  in ShanJhai. Hackworth  detoured around the
intersection anyway. HavinJ never done anythinJ illeJal in  his life, he was
startled to understand, all of  a sudden, that a ruthless constabulary was a
crucial resource to more imaJinative sorts of criminals, such as himself.

       Countless times  that  afternoon, Hackworth  had  been overcome  by
shame, and as many times he had fouJht it off  with  rationali]ation:  What
was so bad about what he was doinJ? He was not sellinJ  any of  the new
technoloJies that Lord  Finkle-McGraw  had paid Bespoke to  develop. He

88
was not profitinJ directly.  He was Must tryinJ to secure a better place in the
world for his descendants, which was every father's responsibility.

       Old  ShanJhai was close to the HuanJ Pu; the mandarins had once sat
in their  Jarden pavilions  enMoyinJ the river  view. Within   a few  minutes
Hackworth had crossed a bridJe into  PudonJ and was  naviJatinJ narrow
ravines between illuminated skyscrapers, headinJ for the coast a few miles
farther to the east.

       Hackworth   had been  catapulted out  of   the  rank-and-file  and  into
Bespoke's elite ranks by his invention  of  the mediatronic chopstick.  He'd
been workinJ in San Francisco at the time. The company was thinkinJ hard
about thinJs  Chinese, tryinJ  to  one-up the Nipponese, who  had already
fiJured out  a way  to Jenerate passable rice (five different  varieties, yet!)
direct from Feed, bypassinJ the whole paddy/coolie rat race, enablinJ two
billion  peasants to hanJ up  their  conical hats and  Jet into  some serious
leisure time—and  don't think  for  one  moment that the  Nipponese didn't
already have some suJJestions for what they miJht do with it. Some Jenius
at    headTuarters,    stewinJ     over    Nippon's     prohibitive      lead     in
nanotechnoloJical rice  production, decided  the only  thinJ   for  it  was  to
leapfroJ them by mass-producinJ entire meals, from wonton all the way to
diJital interactive fortune  cookies. Hackworth Jot the seeminJly trivial  Mob
of proJramminJ the matter compiler to extrude chopsticks.

       Now,   doinJ  this  in   plastic  was  idiotically   simple—polymers   and
nanotechnoloJy went toJether like  toothpaste and tubes. But  Hackworth,
who'd eaten his share of Chinese as a student, had never taken well to the
plastic chopsticks, which were slick and treacherous in the blunt hands of a
gwailo. Bamboo was better—and not that much harder to proJram, if  you
Must had a bit of imaJination. Once he'd made that conceptual leap, it wasn't
lonJ before he  came up with  the idea of  sellinJ  advertisinJ space on the
damn thinJs, chopstick handles and Chinese columnar script beinJ a perfect
match. Before lonJ  he was presentinJ it  to his superiors: eminently  user-
friendly bamboid chopsters with colorful advertisinJ messaJes continuously
scrollinJ up their handles in real time, like news headlines in Times STuare.

89
For that, Hackworth was kicked upstairs to Bespoke and across the Pacific
to Atlantis/ShanJhai.

       He  saw these chopsticks everywhere now. To  the ETuity  Lords, the
idea had been worth billions; to Hackworth, another week's paycheck. That
was the difference between the classes, riJht there.

       He  wasn't doinJ  that  badly,  compared to most  other  people in  the
world, but it still  rankled him. He wanted more for Fiona. He wanted Fiona
to Jrow   up with   some eTuity of   her own.  And  not  Must a few pennies
invested in common stocks, but a serious position in a maMor company.

       StartinJ  your  own company  and makinJ  it  successful was the only
way. Hackworth had thouJht about it from time to time,  but he hadn't done
it. He wasn't sure why not; he had plenty of  Jood ideas. Then he'd noticed
that Bespoke was full of  people with Jood  ideas who never Jot around to
startinJ  their  own   companies. And   he'd  met  a  few   biJ   lords,  spent
considerable time with Lord Finkle-McGraw developinJ Runcible, and seen
that they weren't really  smarter than he. The difference lay in  personality,
not in native intelliJence.

       ,t  was too late for  Hackworth to  chanJe his personality, but it  wasn't
too late for Fiona.

       Before  Finkle-McGraw  had come to him  with  the idea for Runcible,
Hackworth  had spent a  lot  of   time  ponderinJ  this  issue, mostly  while
carryinJ Fiona  throuJh the park  on his  shoulders. He knew that  he must
seem distant to his  dauJhter, thouJh he loved  her so—but only  because,
when he was  with  her, he  couldn't stop  thinkinJ  about her  future. How
could he inculcate her with the nobleman's emotional stance—the pluck to
take risks with her life, to found  a company, perhaps found several of them
even after the first efforts had failed? He had read the bioJraphies of several
notable peers and found few common threads between them.

       -ust  when  he was  about to  Jive  up  and attribute  it  all   to  random
chance, Lord Finkle-McGraw had invited  him over to  his club and, out of
nowhere, beJun talkinJ about precisely the same issue.

90
       Finkle-McGraw  couldn't prevent his JranddauJhter Eli]abeth's parents
from sendinJ her to  the very schools for which  he had lost all  respect; he
had no riJht to interfere. ,t was his role as a Jrandparent to indulJe and Jive
Jifts. But why  not Jive  her a Jift that  would supply the inJredient missinJ
in those schools?

       ,t  sounds inJenious, Hackworth had said, startled by Finkle-McGraw's
offhanded nauJhtiness. But what is that inJredient?

       ,  don't exactly know, Finkle-McGraw  had said, but as a startinJ-point,
,  would  like   you  to   Jo  home  and  ponder  the  meaninJ  of  the  word
subversive.

       Hackworth didn't have to ponder it for lonJ, perhaps because he'd been
toyinJ  with  these ideas so lonJ  himself. The  seed of this  idea had been
JerminatinJ in his mind for  some months now but had not bloomed, for the
same reason that  none  of  Hackworth's  ideas  had ever  developed  into
companies. He lacked an inJredient  somewhere, and as he now reali]ed,
that inJredient  was  subversiveness. Lord  Alexander  ChunJ-Sik  Finkle-
McGraw, the embodiment of the Victorian establishment, was a subversive.
He  was unhappy  because his  children  were  not   subversives and  was
horrified at the thouJht of  Eli]abeth  beinJ raised in the stodJy tradition  of
her parents. So now he was tryinJ to subvert his own JranddauJhter.

       A  few  days later, the Jold  pen on Hackworth's  watch chain chimed.
Hackworth pulled out a blank  sheet of paper and summoned his mail. The
followinJ  appeared on the paJe:

91
        8nderneath  an old oak tree
        There was of swine a huge company 
        That grunted as they crunched the mast: 
        For that  was ripe, and fell  full fast. 
        Then they trotted away, for the wind  gr ew high:
        2ne acorn  they left, and no more might  you spy. 
        Next came a Raven, that liked not such folly: 
        He belonged, they did say, to the witch Melancholy! 
        Blacker was he than blackest Met, 
        Flew low  in the rain,  and his feathers not wet. 
        He picked up the acorn and buried  it straight 
        By the side of a river  both deep and great. 
                          Where then did the Raven go? 
                          He went high and low, 
        2ver  hill,  over dale, did the black  Raven go.
                          Many Autumns, many Springs 
                          Travelled he with  wandering wings: 
                          Many summers, many Winters— 
                          I can't  tell half  his adventures. 
        At length he came back, and with him  a She 
        And the acorn was grown to  a tall oak  tree. 
        They built them a nest in the topmost bough, 
        And young ones they had, and were happy enow .
        But soon came a Woodman in leathern guise, 
        His brow, like  a pent-house, hung over his eyes. 
        He'd an axe in his hand, not  a word he spoke, 
        But with many a hem!  and a sturdy stroke, 
        At length he brought down  the poor Raven's own oak. 
        His young ones were killed;  for they could  not depart, 
        And their mother  did die of a broken heart. 


 

        The boughs from the trunk the Woodman did sever;
        And they floated it  down on the course of the river. 
        They sawed it in planks, and its  bark they did strip, 
        And with this  tree and others they made a good ship. 
        The ship, it was launched;  but in sight of  the land 
        Such a storm there did rise as no ship would  withstand. 
        It bulged on a rock,  and the waves rush'd in fast; 
        Round and round flew the Raven, and cawed to the blast. 
        He heard the last shriek of the perishing  souls— 
        See! see! o'er the topmast the mad water rolls! 
                          Right glad  was the Raven, and off he went fleet, 
        And Death riding  home on a cloud he did  meet, 
        And he thank'd him again  and again for  this tr eat:
                          They had taken his all,  and RE9ENGE IT  WAS SWEET!

      Mr. Hackworth:

 

      , hope the above poem illuminates the ideas , only touched on durinJ our meetinJ of Tuesday
      last, and that it may contribute to your parœmioloJical studies.

 

      ColeridJe wrote it in reaction to the tone of contemporary children's literature, which was
      didactic, much like the stuff they feed to our children in the “best” schools. As you can see, his
      concept of a children's poem is refreshinJly nihilistic. Perhaps this sort of material miJht help to
      inculcate the souJht-after Tualities.

 

      , look forward to further conversations on the subMect.

 

      Finkle-McGraw

 

        This   was  only  the  startinJ-point     of  development   that  had  lasted  for  two
years  and  culminated    today.   Christmas   was  Must over  a  month   away.  Four-
year-old     Eli]abeth      Finkle-McGraw        would      receive    the    Young    Lady's
Illustrated    Primer   from   her Jrandfather.

        Fiona   Hackworth    would   be JettinJ    a copy  of  the  ,llustrated   Primer   too,
for  this  had been  -ohn   Percival   Hackworth's    crime:   He  had proJrammed    the
matter  compiler    to  place  the  cockleburs    on  the outside   of  Eli]abeth's     book.
He had  paid   Dr.  ;   to  extract   a terabyte   of  data  from   one  of  the  cockleburs.
That  data  was,   in  fact,   an encrypted    copy   of  the  matter   compiler    proJram
that  had  Jenerated   the  Young  Lady's   Illustrated    Primer.    He  had  paid  Dr.  ;
for  the  use  of  one  of  his  matter   compilers,    which   was  connected   to  private
Sources  owned  by  Dr.  ;   and  not  connected   to any  Feed.  He  had  Jenerated  a
second,  secret copy   of  the Primer.

93
       The cockleburs had already self-destructed, leavinJ no evidence of his
crime. Dr. ;   probably had a copy of  the proJram on his  computers, but it
was encrypted, and Dr. ;  was smart enouJh simply to  erase the thinJ and
free up the storaJe, knowinJ that the encryption schemes apt to be used by
someone like Hackworth could not be cracked without divine intervention.

       Before  lonJ  the streets widened, and the hush of  tires  on pavement
blended with  the buller  of  waves aJainst  the Jradual shores of  PudonJ.
Across the bay, the white liJhts of the New Atlantis Clave rose up above the
particolored mosaic of the Leased Territories. ,t seemed a lonJ way off, so
on impulse Hackworth rented a velocipede from an old man who had set up
a stall in  the lee  of  the Causeway's thrust bearinJ. He rode  out onto  the
Causeway and, inviJorated by  the cool  moist air  on his  face and hands,
decided to pedal for  a while.  When  he reached the arch, he allowed  the
bike's internal batteries to carry him up the slope. At the summit he turned it
off and beJan to coast down the other side, enMoyinJ the speed.

       His  top hat flew  off.  ,t  was a Jood  one, with  a smart band that was
supposed to make these mishaps a thinJ of  the  past, but as an enJineer,
Hackworth   had   never   taken   the   manufacturer's  promise   seriously.
Hackworth was JoinJ too fast to  make a safe 8-turn, and so he put on the
brakes.

       When he finally   Jot himself  turned around, he was unable to see his
hat. He did  see another cyclist cominJ  toward him.  ,t was  a younJ man,
covered in a slick Nanobar outfit.  Except for  his head, which was smartly
adorned with Hackworth's top hat.

       Hackworth  was prepared to iJnore this Mape; it was probably the only
way the boy  could safely  Jet the hat down  the hill,  as prudence dictated
keepinJ both hands on the handlebars.

       But   the boy   did  not  seem to  be  applyinJ   his  brakes, and  as he
accelerated toward Hackworth, he actually sat up, takinJ both hands off the
handlebars, and Jripped the brim  of the  hat with  both hands. Hackworth

94
thouJht the boy was preparinJ to throw it back as he went by, but instead he
pulled it down onto his head and Jrinned insolently as he shot past.

       “Say!  Stop riJht there! You have my hat!” Hackworth shouted, but the
boy  did  not   stop.  Hackworth   stood  astride  his  bicycle   and  watched
unbelievinJly as the boy beJan to fade into the distance. Then he turned on
the bicycle's power assist and beJan chasinJ him.

       His  natural impulse  had been to summon the  police. But  since they
were on the Causeway, this would mean the ShanJhai Police aJain. ,n any
case, they could not possibly have responded fast enouJh to catch this boy,
who was well on his way to  the end of the Causeway, where he could fork
off into any of the Leased Territories.

       Hackworth  nearly cauJht him. Without the power assist it would have
been no contest, as Hackworth exercised daily in  his club  while  this boy
had the pudJy, pasty look typical of thetes. But the boy had a considerable
head start. By the time they  reached the first ramp leadinJ  down into  the
Leased Territories, Hackworth was  only  ten or  twenty meters away, Must
close enouJh that he could not resist followinJ the boy down the ramp. An
overhead siJn read: ENCHANTMENT.

       They both picked up more speed on the ramp, and once aJain the boy
reached up to Jrip the brim of the top hat. This  time the bike's front wheel
turned the wronJ way. The boy erupted from the seat. The bicycle skittered
into the irrelevant distance and clattered into somethinJ. The boy bounced
once, rolled, and skidded for a couple of meters. The hat, its crown partially
collapsed, rolled on its brim, toppled, and wobbled to a stop. Hackworth hit
the brakes hard and overshot the boy for some distance. As before, it took
him lonJer than he would have liked to Jet turned around.

       And  then he knew for the first time that the boy was not alone but part
of a  JanJ,  probably  the same Jroup  he'd seen in  ShanJhai;  that they'd
followed him  onto the Causeway and taken advantaJe of his fallen top hat
to lure him into the Leased Territories; and that the rest of the JanJ, four or
five boys on bicycles, was cominJ toward him down the ramp, cominJ fast;

95
and in  the  foJ  of  liJht   from  all   of  the Leased Territories'  mediatronic
billboards Jlittered the chromium chains of their nunchuks.


                Miranda;   how she became a ractor; her early career.


From the aJe of five, Miranda  wanted to be in a ractive. ,n her early teens,
after Mother  had taken her  away from  Father and Father's money, she'd
worked  as a  maid-of-all-work,   choppinJ  onions  and polishinJ   people's
sterlinJ-silver salvers, cake combs, fish trowels, and Jrape shears. As soon
as she Jot Jood enouJh with hair and makeup to pass for an eiJhteen-year-
old, she worked  as a Joverness for five  years, which  paid  a little  better.
With her  looks she probably could  have Jotten a Mob as a lady's maid or
parlormaid and become an 8pper Servant, but she preferred the Joverness
Mob. Whatever bad thinJs her parents had done to her alonJ the way, they
had at least put her throuJh some nice schools, where she'd learned to read
Greek, conMuJate Latin verbs, speak a couple of Romance lanJuaJes, draw,
paint, inteJrate a few  simple functions,  and play the piano. WorkinJ  as a
Joverness, she could put it  all  to use. Besides, she preferred even bratty
children to adults.

       When  the parents finally  draJJed their worn-out  asses home to Jive
their  children  4uality    Time,  Miranda   would   run  to  her   subterranean
Tuarters and Jet into  the  cheapest, trashiest ractive she could  find.  She
wasn't JoinJ to make the mistake of spendinJ all her money beinJ in fancy
ractives. She wanted to be a payee, not a payer, and you could practice your
ractinJ Must as well in a dead shoot-'em-up as a live Shakespeare.

       As  soon as she had saved up her ucus, she made the lonJ-dreamed-of
trip to the mod parlor, strode in with her Mawline ridinJ hiJh as the hull of a
clipper ship above a black turtleneck, lookinJ very  like a ractor, and asked
for the -odie. That turned a few heads in the waitinJ room. From there on it
was all very good, madam, and please make yourself comfortable here and
would you like tea, madam. ,t  was the first time  since she and her mother
had left home that  anyone had offered her tea, instead of orderinJ  her to

96
make some, and she  knew perfectly  well   it  would  be the  last time  for
several years, even if she Jot lucky.

       The tat machine worked on her for sixteen hours; they dripped Valium
into her arm so she wouldn't whine. Most tats nowadays went on like a slap
on the back. “You sure you want the skull?” “Yeah, I'm  sure.” “Positive?”
“Positive.”  “2kay—”    and SPLAT there was the skull, drippinJ  blood and
lymph, blasted throuJh your epidermis with  a wave of pressure that nearly
knocked you out of the chair. But a dermal Jrid was a whole different thinJ,
and a -odie was top of the line, it had a hundred times as many 'sites as the
lo-res Jrid sported by many  a porn starlet, somethinJ like ten thousand of
them in the  face alone. The Jrossest part was when the machine reached
down her throat to plant a trail  of nanophones from her vocal cords all the
way up to her Jums. She closed her eyes for that one.

       She was Jlad  she'd done it on the day  before Christmas because she
couldn't have handled the kids afterward. Her face swelled up Must like they
said it would, especially around the lips and eyes where the 'site density was
Jreatest. They Jave her creams and druJs, and she used them. The day after
that, her  mistress double-taked when  Miranda  came upstairs  to  fix  the
children breakfast. But  she didn't  say anythinJ,  probably assuminJ she'd
Jotten slapped around by a drunken boyfriend at a Christmas party. Which
was hardly Miranda's style, but it was a comfortable assumption for a New
Atlantan woman to make.

       When her face had Jotten back to  lookinJ  exactly the same as it had
before her trip  to the  tat parlor, she packed everythinJ  she owned into  a
carpet baJ and took the tube into the city.

       The theatre district had its Jood end and its bad end. The Jood end was
exactly what  and  where it  had  been for  centuries. The  bad  end was  a
vertical rather than a hori]ontal  development, beinJ a couple of  old office
skyscrapers now fallen into  disreputable uses. Like many  such structures
they were remarkably unpleasant to look at, but from the point of view of a
ractive company, they were  ideal. They  had been desiJned to  support  a

97
larJe number of people workinJ  side  by side in  vast Jrids  of semiprivate
cubicles.

       “Let's  have a Jander at your Jrid, sweetheart,” said a man identifyinJ
himself as Mr. Fred (“not my  real name”) Epidermis, after he had removed
his ciJar from his  mouth and Jiven Miranda a prolonJed, methodical, full-
body optical Jrope.

       “My   Jrid  ain't  no  Sweetheart,” she said.  Sweetheart™ and Hero™
were the same Jrid as purveyed to millions of women and men respectively.
The owners didn't  want to  be ractors at all,  Must to look Jood when they
happened to be in a ractive. Some were stupid enouJh to fall for  the hype
that one of these Jrids could serve as the portal to  stardom; a lot of  those
Jirls probably ended up talkinJ to Fred Epidermis.

       “Ooh,  now  ,'m  all  curious,”  he said,  writhinJ  Must enouJh to make
Miranda's lip curl. “Let's put you on staJe and see what you Jot.”

       The cubicles where his ractors toiled were mere head staJes. He had a
few body staJes, thouJh, probably so he could bid on fully ractive porn. He
pointed her toward one of these. She walked in, slammed the door, turned
toward the wall-si]e mediatron, and Jot her first look at her new -odie.

       Fred Epidermis  had put  the staJe into  Constellation Mode. Miranda
was lookinJ   at  a  black  wall   speckled with   twenty  or  thirty   thousand
individual pricks of white  liJht. Taken toJether, they formed a sort of three-
dimensional constellation of Miranda, movinJ as she moved. Each point of
liJht  marked one of the 'sites that had been poked into her skin by  the tat
machine durinJ those sixteen hours. Not shown were the filaments that tied
them all   toJether  into  a  network—a  new  bodily   system  overlaid  and
interlaced with the nervous, lymph, and vascular systems.

       “Holy    shit!   Got   a  fuckinJ    Hepburn  or   somethinJ  here!”   Fred
Epidermis was exclaiminJ, watchinJ  her on a  second monitor outside the
staJe.

98
       “,t's  a -odie,” she said, but she stumbled over the words as the field of
stars moved, trackinJ the displacements of her Maw and lips. Outside, Fred
Epidermis was wieldinJ the editinJ controls, ]oominJ  in on her face, which
was dense as a Jalactic core. By comparison, her arms and leJs were wispy
nebulas and the back of  her head nearly  invisible,  with  a  Jrand total  of
maybe a  hundred 'sites  placed around  her  scalp like   the vertices  of  a
Jeodesic dome. The eyes were empty holes, except (she imaJined) when
she closed her eyes. -ust to check it out, she winked into the mediatron. The
'sites on her  eyelids were dense as Jrass blades on  a puttinJ  Jreen, but
accordioned toJether except  when the  lid  expanded over  the  eye. Fred
Epidermis recoJni]ed the move and ]oomed in so violently on her winkinJ
eye that she  nearly threw  herself  back on  her ass. She could  hear him
chortlinJ. “You'll  Jet  used to it, honey,” he said. “-ust hold  still so ,  check
the 'sites on your lips.”

       He panned to her lips, rotated them this way and that, as she puckered
and pursed. She was Jlad they'd druJJed her  out of  her mind  while they
were doinJ the lips; thousands of nanosites in there.

       “Looks  like  we  Jot ourselves an artiste  here,”  Fred Epidermis said.
“Lemme try you in one of our most challenJinJ roles.”

       Suddenly a  blond, blue-eyed woman was  standinJ in  the mediatron,
perfectly apinJ Miranda's posture, wearinJ biJ hair, a white sweater with a
biJ letter F in the middle, and a preposterously short skirt. She was carryinJ
biJ colored puffy  thinJs.  Miranda recoJni]ed  her, from old  passives she'd
seen on the mediatron, as an American teenaJer from the previous century.
“This is Spirit.  A little  old-fashioned to you  and me, but popular with tube
feeders,” said Fred Epidermis. “  'Course your Jrid's way  overkill  for  this,
but hey, we're about JivinJ   the customer what they  want—movinJ  those
bids, you know.”

       But  Miranda  wasn't really  listeninJ;  for the  first  time ever, she was
watchinJ another person move exactly as she moved, as the staJe mapped
Miranda's Jrid onto this imaJinary  body. Miranda pressed her lips toJether

as if she'd Must put on lipstick, and  Spirit did  the same. She winked,  and
Spirit winked. She touched her nose, and Spirit Jot a face full of pom-pom.

       “Let's  run you throuJh a scene,” said Fred Epidermis.

       Spirit  vanished and was replaced by an electronic form with blanks for
names, numbers, dates,  and  other  data. He   flashed throuJh   it  before
Miranda could really read it; they didn't need a contract for a dry run.

       Then she saw Spirit aJain, this time from two different  camera anJles.
The mediatron had split up into several panes. One was a camera anJle on
Spirit's face, which still  did  whatever Miranda's face did. One was a two-
shot showinJ  Spirit  and  an  older man,  standinJ  in  a room  full   of  biJ
machines. Another pane showed a closeup of the old  man, who  as Spirit
reali]ed was  beinJ played by  Fred Epidermis.  The old  man said, “Okay,
keep in mind we usually play this throuJh a head staJe, so you don't control
Spirit's arms and leJs, Must her face—”

       “How  do ,  walk around?” Miranda said. Spirit's lips moved with  hers,
and from  the mediatron came Spirit's  voice—sTueaky and breathy at the
same time.   The  staJe  was  proJrammed  to   take  the  feeds  from   the
nanophones in her throat and disp them into a different envelope.

       “You  don't.  Computer decides where you  Jo,  when. Our  dirty  little
secret: This isn't really that ractive, it's Must a plot tree—but it's Jood enouJh
for our clientele because all the leaves of the tree—the ends of the branches,
you understand—are exactly the same, namely what the payer wants—you
follow? Well, you'll  see,” said the old man on the screen, readinJ Miranda's
confusion in Spirit's face. What looked like Juarded skepticism on Miranda
came across as bubble-brained innocence on Spirit.

       “Cue!  Follow  the fuckinJ cues! This isn't improv  workshop!”  shouted
the old man.

       Miranda checked the other panes on the display. One she reckoned was
a map of the  room, showinJ  her location and the  old man's, with  arrows

100
occasionally pulsinJ   in   the  direction  of   movement. The   other  was  a
prompter, with a line waitinJ for her, flashinJ red.

       “Oh,  hello, Mr.  Willie!”   she said, “, know  school's out, and you must
be very tired after a lonJ day of teachinJ shop to all of those nasty boys, but
, was wonderinJ if , could ask you for a biJ, biJ favor.”

       “Certainly,  Jo ahead, whatever,” said Fred Epidermis throuJh the face
and body of Mr. Willie, not even pretendinJ to emote.

       “Well,  it's  Must that , have this appliance that's very important to me,
and it seems to have broken. , was wonderinJ if you knew how to fix—one
of these,” Miranda said. On the mediatron, Spirit  said the same thinJ. But
Spirit's hand was movinJ. She was holdinJ somethinJ up next to  her face.
An elonJated Jlossy white plastic thinJ. A vibrator.

       “Well,”   said Mr. Willie,  “it's  a scientific fact that all  electrical devices
work on the same principles, so in theory , should be able to help you. But ,
must confess, ,'ve never seen an appliance Tuite like that one. Would you
mind explaininJ what it is and what it does?”

       “,'d  be more than happy to—” said Miranda, but then the display fro]e
and Fred Epidermis  cut  her off  by  shoutinJ  throuJh  the door.  “EnouJh
already,” he said. “, Must had to make sure you could read.”

       He  opened the staJe door and said, “You're  hired. Cubicle  238. My
commission is  eiJhty  percent. The  dormitory's  upstairs—pick your  own
bunk, and clean it out. You can't afford to live anywhere else.”


                       Harv  brings Nell a present; she experiments
                                              with the Primer. 

101
When Harv came back home, he was walkinJ with all of his weiJht on one
foot. When the liJht  struck the smudJes on his face in the riJht  way, Nell
could see streaks of  red  mixed  in  with  the  dirt  and  the toner. He  was
breathinJ fast, and he swallowed heavily and often, as thouJh throwinJ up
were much on  his  mind. But  he  was not  empty-handed. His arms  were
crossed tiJhtly across his belly. He was carryinJ thinJs in his Macket.

       “,  made out, Nell,”   he said, seeinJ his sister's face and knowinJ that
she was too scared to talk first. “Didn't  Jet much, but Jot  some. Got some
stuff for the Flea Circus.”

       Nell  wasn't sure what the Flea Circus was, but she had learned that it
was Jood to have stuff to take there, that Harv usually came back from the
Flea Circus with an access code for a new ractive.

       Harv  shouldered the liJht switch on  and kneeled in the middle of  the
room before relaxinJ his arms, lest some small thinJ fall out and be lost in a
corner. Nell sat in front of him and watched.

       He took  out a piece of  Mewelry swinJinJ ponderously at the end of a
Jold chain. ,t was circular, smooth Jold on one side and white on the other.
The white side was protected under a flattened Jlass dome. ,t had numbers
written around the edJe, and a couple of slender metal thinJs like daJJers,
one lonJer than the other, Moined at their hilts in the center. ,t made a noise
like mice tryinJ to eat their way throuJh a wall in the middle of the niJht.

       Before she could ask about it, Harv had taken out other thinJs. He had
a few   cartridJes  from  his  mite   trap.  Tomorrow  Harv  would   take the
cartridJe down to the Flea Circus and find out if  he'd cauJht anythinJ, and
whether it was worth money.

       There were other thinJs like buttons. But Harv saved the biJJest thinJ
for last, and he withdrew it with ceremony.

       “,  had to  fiJht  for  this, Nell,”   he said. “,  fouJht  hard because , was
afraid the others would break it up for parts. ,'m JivinJ it to you.”

102
       ,t  appeared to be a flat decorated box. Nell could tell immediately that
it was fine.  She had not seen many fine thinJs  in her life,  but  they had a
look of their own, dark and rich like chocolate, with Jlints of Jold.

       “Both  hands,” Harv admonished her, “it's heavy.”

       Nell  reached out with  both hands and took it.  Harv was riJht,  it  was
heavier than it looked. She had to lay it down in  her lap or she'd drop it. ,t
was not a box at all. ,t  was a solid thinJ.  The top was printed with  Jolden
letters. The left edJe was rounded and smooth, made of somethinJ that felt
warm and soft but stronJ. The other edJes were indented sliJhtly, and they
were cream-colored.

       Harv could not put up with the wait. “Open it,”  he said.

       “How?”

       Harv leaned toward her, cauJht the upper-riJht corner under his finJer,
and flipped it. The whole lid of the thinJ bent upward around a hinJe on the
left side, pullinJ a flutter of cream-colored leaves after it.

       8nderneath  the cover was a  piece of paper with  a  picture on it  and
some more letters.

       On the first  paJe of the book was a picture  of a little  Jirl  sittinJ  on a
bench. Above the bench was a thinJ like a ladder, except it was hori]ontal,
supported at each  end by  posts.  Thick  vines  twisted  up the  posts  and
Jripped the ladder, where  they burst into  huJe flowers.  The Jirl   had her
back to  Nell;  she was lookinJ  down  a Jrassy slope  sprinkled with   little
flowers toward a blue pond. On the other side of  the pond rose mountains
like the ones they supposedly had in the middle of New Chusan, where the
fanciest Vickys of all had their æstival houses. The Jirl had a book open on
her lap.

       The facinJ paJe had a little picture in the upper left, consistinJ of more
vines and flowers wrapped around a Jiant eJJ-shaped letter. But the rest of
that paJe was nothinJ but tiny black letters without decoration. Nell turned

103
it and found two  more paJes of letters, thouJh a couple of  them were biJ
ones with pictures drawn around them. She turned another paJe and found
another picture. ,n this one, the  little  Jirl  had set aside her book and was
talkinJ to a biJ  black bird  that had apparently Jotten its foot tanJled up in
the vines overhead. She flipped another paJe.

       The paJes she'd already turned were under her left thumb. They were
tryinJ to work  their way loose, as if they were alive. She had to press down
harder and harder to keep them there. Finally they bulJed up in the middle
and slid out from underneath her thumb and, flop-flop-flop, returned to the
beJinninJ of the story.

       “Once  upon a  time,”  said a  woman's voice,  “there  was a little   Jirl
named Eli]abeth who liked  to sit  in the bower in  her Jrandfather's Jarden
and read story-books.”  The  voice was  soft,  meant Must for her, with  an
expensive Victorian accent.

       Nell  slammed the book shut and pushed it away. ,t slid across the floor
and came to rest by the sofa.

       The  next day, Mom's  boyfriend Tad came home in  a bad mood.  He
slammed his six-pack  down on  the kitchen  table, pulled  out a  beer, and
headed for the livinJ   room.  Nell  was tryinJ   to Jet  out  of  the way.  She
picked up Dinosaur,  Duck, Peter Rabbit,  and Purple, her  maJic wand,  a
paper baJ that was actually a car her kids could drive around in, and a piece
of cardboard that was a sword for killinJ pirates. Then she ran for the room
where she and Harv slept, but Tad had already come in with  his beer and
beJun rootinJ throuJh  the stuff on  the sofa with  his other hand, tryinJ  to
find the control  pad for the mediatron. He threw a lot  of Harv's and Nell's
toys on the floor and then stepped on the book with his bare foot.

       “Ouch,  Jod  damn it!”  Tad  shouted. He looked down  at the book  in
disbelief. “What   the fuck  is  this?!”  He  wound  up as if   to  kick  it,  then
thouJht better of  it,  rememberinJ  he was barefoot.  He picked  it  up and
hefted it, lookinJ straiJht at Nell and JettinJ a fix on her ranJe and a]imuth.
“Stupid  little  cunt,  how many  times do  ,  have to  tell  you to  keep your

104
fuckinJ shit cleaned up?!” Then he turned away from her sliJhtly, wrappinJ
his arm around his body, and snapped the book straiJht at her head like a
Frisbee.

       She stood watchinJ it come toward her because it did not occur to her
to Jet  out of  the way, but  at the  last moment the covers flew  open. The
paJes spread apart. They all bent like feathers as they hit  her in the  face,
and it didn't hurt at all.

       The book fell to the floor at her feet, open to an illustrated paJe.

       The picture was of a biJ  dark man and a little Jirl  in a cluttered room,
the man anJrily flinJinJ a book at the little Jirl's head.

       “Once upon a time there was a little Jirl named Cunt,” the book said.

       “My  name is Nell,” Nell  said.

       A  tiny disturbance propaJated throuJh the Jrid of letters on the facinJ
paJe.

       “Your  name's mud if  you don't  fuckinJ  clean this shit up,”  Tad said.
“But do it later, , want some fuckinJ privacy for once.”

       Nell's  hands were full, and so she shoved the book down the hallway
and into  the kids'  room  with  her foot.  She dumped  all  her stuff  on  her
mattress and then ran back and shut the door. She left her maJic wand and
sword nearby in case she should need them, then set Dinosaur, Duck, Peter,
and Purple into bed, all in a neat line, and pulled the blanket up under their
chins. “Now you Jo to bed and you Jo to bed and you Jo to bed and you Jo
to bed, and be Tuiet because you are all beinJ nauJhty and botherinJ Tad,
and ,'ll see you in the morninJ.”

       “Nell  was puttinJ  her children to  bed and decided to read them some
stories,” said the book's voice.

105
       Nell  looked at the book, which had flopped itself open aJain, this time
to an illustration showinJ a Jirl  who looked much like Nell,  except that she
was wearinJ a beautiful flowinJ dress and had ribbons in her hair. She was
sittinJ  next  to  a  miniature   bed with   four  children   tucked  beneath its
flowered coverlet: a dinosaur, a duck, a bunny, and a baby with purple hair.
The Jirl who  looked like Nell  had a book on her lap. “For  some time Nell
had been puttinJ them to bed without readinJ to them,” the book continued,
“but now  the children were not so tiny  anymore, and Nell  decided that in
order to brinJ them up properly, they must have bedtime stories.”

       Nell  picked up the book and set it on her lap.


                           Nell's first  experiences with the Primer.


The book spoke in  a lovely  contralto, with  an  accent like the very  finest
Vickys. The  voice was like  a real  person's—thouJh not like  anyone Nell
had ever met. ,t  rose and fell  like slow  surf on  a warm beach, and when
Nell closed her eyes, it swept her out into an ocean of feelinJs.

Once  uSon a  tLme tKere  was  a OLttOe PrLncess named NeOO wKo was
LmSrLsoned Ln a taOO dark castOe on an LsOand Ln tKe mLddOe oI a Jreat

       PrLncess  NeOO and Harv couOd not  Oeave tKe Dark   CastOe, but
Irom tLme to tLme a raven wouOd come to vLsLt tKem …

 

       “What's a raven?” Nell said.

       The illustration  was a colorful  paintinJ  of the  island seen from up in
the sky. The island rotated downward  and out of  the picture, becominJ  a
view toward the ocean hori]on. ,n  the middle was a black dot. The picture

106
]oomed in  on  the black  dot,  and it  turned  out to  be  a bird.  BiJ  letters
appeared beneath. “R A V E N,”  the book  said. “Raven. Now, say it  with
me.”

       “Raven.”

       “Very  Jood! Nell, you are a clever Jirl, and you have much talent with
words. Can you spell raven?”

       Nell  hesitated. She  was still  blushinJ  from  the  praise. After  a  few
seconds, the first of the letters beJan to blink. Nell prodded it.

       The letter Jrew until  it had pushed all the other letters and pictures off
the edJes of the paJe. The loop on top shrank and became a head, while the
lines stickinJ out the bottom developed into leJs and beJan to scissor. “R is
for Run,” the book said. The picture kept on chanJinJ until it  was a picture
of Nell.  Then  somethinJ fu]]y   and  red appeared beneath her feet. “Nell
Runs on the Red RuJ,” the book said, and as it spoke, new words appeared.

       “Why  is she runninJ?”

       “Because an AnJry   AlliJator  Appeared,”  the book said,  and panned
back Tuite some distance to show an alliJator, waddlinJ alonJ ridiculously,
no threat to the fleet Nell. The alliJator  became frustrated and curled itself
into a circle, which became a small letter. “A is for AlliJator. The Very Vast
alliJator Vainly Viewed Nell's Valiant Velocity.”

       The little   story went on to  include an Excited  Elf  who was NibblinJ
Noisily  on some Nuts. Then the picture of the Raven came back, with the
letters beneath. “Raven. Can you spell raven, Nell?” A hand materiali]ed on
the paJe and pointed to the first letter.

       “R,”  Nell  said.

       “Very  Jood!  You are  a clever Jirl,   Nell,  and Jood with  letters,”  the
book said. “What is this letter?”  and it pointed to the second one. This one

107
Nell  had forJotten.  But  the book  told  her a  story  about an Ape  named
Albert.


               A young hooligan  before the court of Judge Fang; the
                             magistrate confers with  his advisers; 
                                             Justice is served. 



The  revolvinJ   chain   of   a  nunchuk  has  a   uniTue  radar  siJnature—
reminiscent of that of a helicopter blade, but noisier,” Miss Pao said, Ja]inJ
up at -udJe FanJ over the half-lenses of  her phenomenoscopic spectacles.
Her eyes went out  of  focus, and she winced;  she had been lost in  some
enhanced three-dimensional imaJe, and the adMustment to dull reality was
disorientinJ. “A  cluster of such patterns was recoJni]ed by one of ShanJhai
P.D.'s sky-eyes at ten seconds after 2351 hours.”

       As Miss  Pao worked her way throuJh this summary, imaJes appeared
on the biJ sheet of mediatronic paper that -udJe FanJ had unrolled across
his brocade tablecloth and held down with carved Made paperweiJhts. At the
moment, the imaJe was a map of  a Leased Territory called Enchantment,
with  one  location,  near the  Causeway, hiJhliJhted.   ,n  the  corner  was
another pane containinJ a standard picture of an anticrime sky-eye, which
always looked, to -udJe FanJ, like  an American football  as redesiJned by
fetishists: Jlossy and black and studded.

       Miss  Pao continued, “The sky-eye dispatched a fliJht of eiJht smaller
aerostats eTuipped with cine cameras.”

       The  kinky  football  was  replaced by  a picture  of  a  teardrop-shaped
craft, about the si]e of an almond, trailinJ a whip antenna, with an orifice at
its nose protected by an inconJruously beautiful  iris.  -udJe FanJ was not
really lookinJ;   at least three-Tuarters of  the cases that came before him
commenced with a summary almost exactly like this one. ,t was a credit to
Miss Pao's seriousness and diliJence that she was able to  tell  each story
afresh. ,t was a challenJe to -udJe FanJ's professionalism for him to listen
to each one in the same spirit.

108
       “ConverJinJ  on the scene,” Miss Pao said, “they recorded activities.”

       The  larJe map imaJe on  -udJe FanJ's scroll  was replaced by a cine
feed. The fiJures were  far away, flocks  of  relatively  dark pixels  nudJinJ
their way across a rouJh Jray  backJround like  starlinJs massinJ before a
winter Jale. They Jot  biJJer and more clearly defined  as the aerostat flew
closer to the action.

       A  man  was curled  on the  street with  his arms  wrapped around his
head. The nunchuks had been put away by this point, and hands were busy
JoinJ  throuJh   the  innumerable  pockets  that  were  to   be  found   in  a
Jentleman's suit. At this point the cine went into slow-mo. A watch flashed
and oscillated hypnotically  at the end of  its Jold  chain. A  silver  fountain
pen Jlowed   like  an  ascendinJ  rocket  and  vanished into   the  folds  of
someone's mite-proof raiment. And then out came somethinJ else, harder to
resolve: larJer, mostly dark, white around the edJe. A book, perhaps.

       “Heuristic   analysis of   the cine  feeds suJJested a  probable  violent
crime in proJress,” Miss Pao said.

       -udJe  FanJ  valued Miss   Pao's services for  many  reasons, but her
deadpan delivery was especially precious to him.

       “So  the sky-eye dispatched another fliJht of aerostats, speciali]ed for
taJJinJ.”

       An  imaJe  of  a taJJer  stat appeared: smaller and narrower than  the
cinestats, reminiscent of a hornet with the winJs stripped off.  The nacelles
containinJ the  tiny  air  turbines,  which  Jave such  devices the power  to
propel themselves throuJh the air, were prominent; it was built for speed.

       “The  suspected assailants adopted countermeasures,” Miss Pao said,
aJain usinJ   that  deadpan tone.  On  the  cine  feed,  the  criminals  were
retreatinJ. The  cinestat followed  them  with  a  nice  trackinJ  shot. -udJe
FanJ, who had watched thousands of hours of film of thuJs departinJ from
the  scenes of  their   crimes,  watched  with   a  discriminatinJ   eye.  Less
sophisticated hoodlums would simply  have run away  in  a panic, but  this

109
Jroup was proceedinJ methodically, two to a bicycle,  one person pedalinJ
and steerinJ while  the  other handled the  countermeasures. Two of them
were discharJinJ fountains of  material into  the air from  canisters on their
bicycles' eTuipment racks, like fire extinJuishers, wavinJ the no]]les  in all
directions.  “FollowinJ     a   pattern  that   has  become   familiar   to    law
enforcement,” Miss Pao said, “they  dispersed adhesive foam that cloJJed
the intakes of the stats' air turbines, renderinJ them inoperative.”

       The  biJ mediatron  had also taken to emittinJ  tremendous flashes of
liJht  that caused -udJe FanJ to close his eyes and pinch the bridJe of  his
nose. After a few of these, the cine feed went dead. “Another suspect used
strobe illumination to  pick out the locations of  the cinestats, then disabled
them with pulses of laser liJht—evidently  usinJ a device, desiJned for this
purpose, that has recently become widespread amonJ the criminal element
in the L.T.”

       The  biJ  mediatron cut  back to  a new  camera anJle on the  oriJinal
scene of  the  crime.  Across the  bottom  of   the scroll   was a  bar  Jraph
depictinJ the elapsed time since the start of the incident, and the practiced
-udJe FanJ noted that it had Mumped backward by a Tuarter of a minute or
so; the narrative had split,  and we were now  seeinJ the other fork  of  the
plot. This  feed depicted a solitary JanJ  member who was tryinJ  to climb
aboard his bicycle even as his comrades were ridinJ away on  contrails of
sticky  foam.  But  the bike  had  been manJled  somehow and  would  not
function. The youth abandoned it and fled on foot.

       8p  in  the corner, the small diaJram of the taJJinJ aerostat ]oomed in
to   a   hiJh   maJnification,    revealinJ   some   of   the   device's   internal
complications, so that it  beJan to look  less like  a hornet and more like  a
cutaway view of a starship. Mounted in the nose was a device that spat out
tiny  darts drawn  from  an interior   maJa]ine.  At  first  these were  almost
invisibly  tiny, but  as the view  continued to ]oom,  the hull  of  the taJJinJ
aerostat Jrew until it resembled the Jentle curve of a planet's hori]on,  and
the darts  became more clearly   visible.  They  were  hexaJonal in   cross-
section, like pencil  stubs. When they were shot out of  the taJ  stat's nose,
they sprouted cruel barbs at the nose and a simple empennaJe at the tail.

110
       “The   suspect had  experienced  a  ballistic   interlude  earlier  in   the
eveninJ,” Miss  Pao said, “reJrettably  not filmed,  and relieved  himself of
excess velocity by means of an ablative techniTue.”

       Miss  Pao was outdoinJ herself. -udJe FanJ raised an eyebrow at her,
briefly hittinJ  the pause button. ChanJ, -udJe FanJ's other assistant, rotated
his enormous, nearly spherical head in the direction of the defendant, who
was  lookinJ   very  small   as  he  stood  before  the  court.   ChanJ,  in   a
characteristic Jesture, reached up and rubbed the palm  of  his hand back
over the short stubble that covered his head, as if he could  not believe he
had such a bad haircut. He opened his sleepy, slitlike eyes Must a notch, and
said to the defendant, “She say you have road rash.”

       The defendant, a pale asthmatic boy, had seemed too awed to be scared
throuJh most of this.  Now the  corners of his mouth twitched.  -udJe FanJ
noticed with approval that he controlled the impulse to smile.

       “ConseTuently,”  Miss  Pao said,  “there were  lapses in  his  Nanobar
inteJument.  An  unknown   number  of  taJ   mites  passed throuJh   these
openinJs and embedded themselves in his clothinJ and flesh. He discarded
all  of  his clothinJ   and scrubbed himself  viJorously   at a  public  shower
before returninJ  to  his  domicile,  but  three hundred  and fifty   taJ  mites
remained in  his flesh  and were  later extracted durinJ  the  course of  our
examination. As usual, the taJ mites were eTuipped with inertial naviJation
systems that recorded all of the suspect's subseTuent movements.”

       The biJ cine feed was replaced by a map of the Leased Territories with
the suspect's movements traced out with a red line.  This boy did  a lot  of
wanderinJ about, even  JoinJ  into  ShanJhai on  occasion, but he  always
came back to the same apartment.

       “After   a pattern was established, the taJ mites automatically spored,”
Miss Pao said.

       The  imaJe of  the  barbed dart altered  itself,  the midsection—which
contained a  taped  record of   the  dart's movements—breakinJ  free  and
acceleratinJ into the void.

111
       “Several  of  the  spores found  their  way  to  a  sky-eye,  where their
contents were downloaded and their serial numbers checked aJainst police
records. ,t  was determined that the  suspect spent much of  his time  in  a
particular apartment. Surveillance was placed on that apartment. One of the
residents clearly matched the suspect seen on the cine feed. The suspect was
placed under arrest and additional taJ mites found in  his body, tendinJ  to
support our suspicions.”

       “Oooh,”  ChanJ blurted, absently, as if he'd Must remembered somethinJ
important.

       “What  do we know about the victim?” -udJe FanJ said.

       “The   cine  stat could  track  him   only  as  far  as the  Jates  of  New
Atlantis,”  Miss Pao said. “His  face was bloody and swollen, complicatinJ
identification.  He  had  also  been taJJed,  naturally—the  taJJer  aerostat
cannot make any distinction between victim and perpetrator—but no spores
were received; we can assume that all of  his taJ mites were detected and
destroyed by Atlantis/ShanJhai's immune system.”

       At  this  point Miss  Pao stopped talkinJ and swiveled  her eyes in the
direction of  ChanJ, who was standinJ Tuiescently with  his hands clasped
behind his back, starinJ down  at the floor  as if  his thick  neck had finally
Jiven way under the weiJht of  his head. Miss Pao cleared her throat once,
twice, three times,  and suddenly ChanJ  came awake. “Excuse me,  Your
Honor,” he said, bowinJ to -udJe FanJ. He rummaJed in a larJe plastic baJ
and withdrew a Jentleman's top hat in poor  condition. “This  was found at
the scene,” he said, finally revertinJ to his native ShanJhainese.

       -udJe  FanJ dropped his  eyes to the  tabletop and then  looked up  at
ChanJ. ChanJ stepped forward and placed the hat  carefully on  the table,
JivinJ  it a little  nudJe as if its  position were not Tuite perfect. -udJe FanJ
reJarded it   for   a  few   moments,  then  withdrew   his  hands  from   the
voluminous sleeves of his robe, picked it up, and flipped it over. The words
-OHN  PERC,VAL   HACKWORTH   were  written   in  Jold  script   on  the
hatband.

112
       -udJe  FanJ cast a siJnificant look  at Miss  Pao, who shook her head.
They had not  yet contacted the victim.   Neither had the  victim  contacted
them,  which   was   interestinJ;   -ohn   Percival   Hackworth   must   have
somethinJ to hide.  The neo-Victorians  were smart; why  did  so many  of
them Jet  muJJed in  the  Leased Territories after  an eveninJ  of  brothel-
crawlinJ?

       “You  have recovered the stolen items?” -udJe FanJ said.

       ChanJ stepped to the table aJain  and laid out  a man's pocket watch.
Then he stepped back, hands clasped behind him, bent his neck aJain, and
watched his feet, which could  not contain themselves from shufflinJ  back
and forth in tiny increments. Miss Pao was JlarinJ at him.

       “There was another item? A book, perhaps?” -udJe FanJ said.

       ChanJ cleared his throat nervously, suppressinJ the urJe to hawk and
spit—an  activity  -udJe   FanJ had  barred  in  his  courtroom.  He  turned
sideways and backed up one step, allowinJ -udJe FanJ to view one of the
spectators: a younJ Jirl, perhaps four years old, sittinJ with  her feet up on
the chair so that her face was blocked by her knees. -udJe FanJ heard the
sound of  a paJe  turninJ  and reali]ed   that the  Jirl   was readinJ  a book
propped up on her thiJhs. She cocked her head this way and that, talkinJ to
the book in a tiny voice.

       “,  must humbly apoloJi]e  to the -udJe,”  ChanJ said in ShanJhainese.
“My  resiJnation is hereby proffered.”

       -udJe FanJ took this with due Jravity. “Why?”

       “,   was unable  to wrest  the  evidence from  the younJ  one's Jrasp,”
ChanJ said.

       “,   have  seen you   kill   adult  men  with   your  hands,”  -udJe  FanJ
reminded him. He  had been raised speakinJ  Cantonese, but could make
himself understood to ChanJ by speakinJ a kind of butchered Mandarin.

113
       “AJe  has not been kind,” ChanJ said. He was thirty-six.

       “The  hour of  noon has passed,” said -udJe FanJ. “Let  us Jo and Jet
some Kentucky Fried Chicken.”

       “As  you wish, -udJe FanJ,” said ChanJ.

       “As  you wish, -udJe FanJ,” said Miss Pao.

       -udJe FanJ switched back to  EnJlish. “Your  case is very serious,” he
said to the boy. “We  will  Jo  and consult the ancient authorities. You will
remain here until we return.”

       “Yes,  sir,”  said  the  defendant, abMectly terrified. This  was  not  the
abstract fear of a first-time   delinTuent; he was sweatinJ and shakinJ.  He
had been caned before.

       The  House of the  Venerable and ,nscrutable Colonel was what  they
called it   when  they  were  speakinJ Chinese.  Venerable because of  his
Joatee, white   as  the   doJwood   blossom,  a  badJe  of   unimpeachable
credibility  in Confucian eyes. ,nscrutable because he had Jone to his Jrave
without divulJinJ   the Secret of the Eleven Herbs and Spices. ,t  had been
the first fast-food franchise established on the Bund, many decades earlier.
-udJe FanJ had what amounted to a private table in the corner. He had once
reduced ChanJ to a state of catalepsis by describinJ an avenue in Brooklyn
that was  lined  with  fried  chicken  establishments for  miles, all   of  them
ripoffs of Kentucky  Fried Chicken. Miss Pao, who had Jrown up in Austin,
Texas, was less easily impressed by these leJends.

       Word of  their arrival  preceded them; their bucket already rested upon
the table. The small plastic cups of Jravy, coleslaw, potatoes, and so on had
been carefully arranJed. As usual, the bucket was placed sTuarely in front
of ChanJ's seat, for he would be responsible for consumption of most of it.
They ate in silence for a few  minutes, communicatinJ throuJh eye contact
and other subtleties, then spent several minutes exchanJinJ polite  formal
chatter.

114
       “SomethinJ struck a chord in my memory,” -udJe FanJ said, when the
time was riJht to  discuss business. “The name TeTuila—the mother of the
suspect and of the little Jirl.”

       “The  name has come before our court  twice before,”  Miss Pao said,
and refreshed his memory of  two  previous cases: one, almost five  years
aJo, in which this woman's lover had been executed, and the second, only a
few months aJo, a case Tuite similar to this one.

       “Ah,  yes,” -udJe FanJ said, “, recall the second case. This boy and his
friends beat a man severely. But nothinJ was stolen. He would  not Jive  a
Mustification for his actions. , sentenced him to three strokes of the cane and
released him.”

       “There  is reason to suspect that the victim  in that  case had molested
the boy's  sister,”  ChanJ  put  in,  “as  he has  a  previous record  of  such
accomplishments.”

       -udJe  FanJ fished a  drumstick out  of the  bucket, arranJed it  on his
napkin,  folded  his  hands,  and siJhed.  “Does   the  boy  have  any  filial
relationships whatsoever?”

       “None,”  said Miss Pao.

       “Would  anyone care to advise me?” -udJe FanJ freTuently asked this
Tuestion; he considered it his duty to teach his subordinates

       Miss  Pao  spoke, usinJ  Must the riJht deJree  of  cautiousness. “The
Master says, “The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That
beinJ established, all practical courses naturally Jrow  up. Filial  piety  and
fraternal submission!—are they not the root of all benevolent actions?' ”

       “How  do you apply the Master's wisdom in this instance?”

       “The  boy has no father—his only possible filial relationship is with the
State. You, -udJe FanJ, are the only representative of the State he is likely

115
to encounter. ,t is your duty to punish the boy firmly—say, with  six strokes
of the cane. This will help to establish his filial piety.”

       “But   the  Master  also  said,  “,f    the  people  be  led  by   laws,  and
uniformity  souJht to be Jiven them by punishments, they will  try  to avoid
the punishments, but have no sense of shame. Whereas, if they be led by
virtue, and uniformity   souJht to be  Jiven them  by the rules  of propriety,
they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become Jood.' ”

       “So   you  are  advocatinJ  leniency   in  this   case?”  Miss  Pao  said,
somewhat skeptically.

       ChanJ chimed in: “  'ManJ Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master
said, “Parents are anxious  lest their  children  should  be sick.”  '  But  the
Master said nothinJ about caninJ.”

       Miss Pao said, “The Master also said, “Rotten wood cannot be carved.'
And, “There  are only  the wise of  the hiJhest class, and the stupid of  the
lowest class, who cannot be chanJed.' ”

       “So  the  Tuestion before  us is:  ,s  the boy  rotten  wood?  His  father
certainly was. , am not certain about the boy, yet.”

       “With   utmost respect, , would  direct your  attention to the Jirl,”   said
ChanJ, “who should be the true subMect of our discussions. The boy may be
lost; the Jirl can be saved.”

       “Who  will   save her?” Miss Pao said. “We have the power to  punish;
we are not Jiven the power to raise children.”

       “This  is the essential dilemma of my position,” -udJe  FanJ said. “The
Mao Dynasty  lacked a  real Mudicial system. When the  Coastal Republic
arose, a Mudicial system was built upon the only model the Middle KinJdom
had ever known, that beinJ the Confucian. But such a system cannot truly
function in  a  larJer  society that  does not adhere to  Confucian precepts.
“From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider
the cultivation of the person the root of everythinJ besides.' Yet how am , to

116
cultivate the  persons of the barbarians for  whom  ,  have perversely been
Jiven responsibility?”

       ChanJ  was  ready for   this  openinJ  and exploited  it   Tuickly.  “The
Master stated in his Great LearninJ that the extension of knowledJe was the
root of all other virtues.”

       “,  cannot send the boy to school, ChanJ.”

       “Think  instead of the Jirl,” ChanJ said, “the Jirl and her book.”

       -udJe FanJ contemplated this for a few moments, thouJh he could see
that Miss Pao badly wanted to say somethinJ.

       “  'The  superior man is correctly  firm,  and not  firm  merely,' ”  -udJe
FanJ said. “Since the victim has not contacted the police seekinJ return of
his property, , will allow  the Jirl to keep the book for her own edification—
as the Master said, “,n teachinJ there should be no distinction of classes.' ,
will  sentence the boy to six strokes of the cane. But , will   suspend all but
one of  those strokes, since he  has displayed the beJinninJs  of  fraternal
responsibility by JivinJ the book to his sister. This is correctly firm.”

       “,  have completed a phenomenoscopic survey of the book,” Miss Pao
said. “,t is not an ordinary book.”

       “,  had already surmised that it was a ractive of some sort,” -udJe FanJ
said.

       “,t  is  considerably more sophisticated than that description implies. ,
believe that it may embody hot ,.P.,” Miss Pao said.

       “You  think that this book incorporates stolen technoloJy?”

       “The victim  works in the Bespoke division of Machine-Phase Systems.
He is an artifex.”

       “,nterestinJ,”  -udJe FanJ said.

117
       “,s  it worthy of further investiJation?”

       -udJe  FanJ  thouJht  about  it   for  a  moment,  carefully  wipinJ   his
finJertips on a fresh napkin.

       “,t  is,” he said.


                               Hackworth  presents the Primer to
                                         Lord Finkle-McGraw. 



“Is the bindinJ and so on what you had in mind?” Hackworth said.

       “Oh,  yes,” said Lord  Finkle-McGraw.  “,f  ,  found it  in an antiTuarian
bookshop, covered with dust, , shouldn't Jive it a second Jlance.”

       “Because if  you were not happy with  any detail,”  Hackworth said, “,
could  recompile  it.”   He  had  come in   hopinJ  desperately that  Finkle-
McGraw would obMect to somethinJ; this miJht Jive him an opportunity to
filch  another  copy  for   Fiona.  But   so  far  the   ETuity  Lord   had  been
uncharacteristically complacent.

       He kept flippinJ  throuJh the book, waitinJ for somethinJ to happen.

       “,t  is unlikely  to do anythinJ interestinJ Must now,” Hackworth said. “,t
won't really activate itself until it bonds.”

       “Bonds?”

       “As   we   discussed, it  sees  and  hears everythinJ   in  its   vicinity,”
Hackworth said. “At the moment, it's lookinJ for a small female. As soon as
a little  Jirl  picks it  up and opens the front  cover for  the first  time, it  will
imprint that child's face and voice into its memory—”

       “BondinJ  with her. Yes, , see.”

118
       “And  thenceforth it  will  see all events and persons in relation to  that
Jirl, usinJ  her as a datum from which to chart a psycholoJical terrain, as it
were. Maintenance of that terrain  is one of  the book's primary  processes.
Whenever the child uses the book, then, it will  perform  a sort of dynamic
mappinJ from the database onto her particular terrain.”

       “You  mean the database of folklore.”

       Hackworth   hesitated. “Pardon  me,  but  not  precisely,  sir.  Folklore
consists of  certain  universal  ideas  that  have  been mapped  onto  local
cultures. For   example, many   cultures have  a  Trickster   fiJure,  so  the
Trickster may be  deemed a universal; but he  appears in different  Juises,
each appropriate to a particular culture's environment. The  ,ndians of  the
American Southwest called him Coyote,  those of the Pacific  Coast called
him  Raven. Europeans called him  Reynard  the Fox.  African-Americans
called him Br'er  Rabbit. ,n  twentieth-century literature he appears first  as
BuJs Bunny and then as the Hacker.”

       Finkle-McGraw  chuckled. “When ,  was a lad, that word had a double
meaninJ. ,t could mean a trickster who broke into thinJs—but it could also
mean an especially skilled coder.”

       “The  ambiJuity   is  common in  post-Neolithic   cultures,”  Hackworth
said. “As  technoloJy  became more important, the  Trickster underwent  a
shift in character and became the Jod of crafts—of technoloJy, if  you will
—while   retaininJ   the  underlyinJ   roJuish  Tualities.   So  we   have  the
Sumerian Enki, the Greek Prometheus and Hermes, Norse Loki, and so on.

       “,n   any case,”  Hackworth continued,  “Trickster/TechnoloJist  is Must
one of the universals. The database is full of  them. ,t's  a cataloJue of the
collective unconscious. ,n the old  days, writers of  children's books had to
map these universals onto concrete symbols familiar to their audience—like
Beatrix Potter mappinJ the Trickster onto Peter Rabbit. This is a reasonably
effective way to do  it, especially if  the society is homoJeneous and static,
so that all children share similar experiences.

119
       “What  my  team and , have done here is to  abstract that process and
develop systems for mappinJ the universals onto the uniTue psycholoJical
terrain of  one child—even  as that terrain chanJes over  time. Hence it  is
important that you  not allow  this book to  fall  into the hands of  any other
little Jirl  until Eli]abeth  has the opportunity to open it up.”

       “8nderstood,”   said Lord  Alexander ChunJ-Sik  Finkle-McGraw.  “,'ll
wrap it  up  myself,  riJht  now.  Compiled some nice  wrappinJ  paper this
morninJ.”  He opened a desk drawer  and took out  a roll  of  thick,  Jlossy
mediatronic paper bearinJ animated Christmas scenes: Santa slidinJ down
the  chimney,  the   ballistic   reindeer,  the  three   =oroastrian  sovereiJns
dismountinJ from their  dromedaries in front of the stable. There was a lull
while Hackworth and Finkle-McGraw  watched the little  scenes; one of the
ha]ards of livinJ   in a world  filled  with  mediatrons was that conversations
were  always  beinJ  interrupted   in  this   way,  and  that   explained  why
Atlantans tried to keep mediatronic commodities to a minimum.  Go into  a
thete's house, and every obMect had movinJ pictures on  it,  everyone sat
around slackMawed, eyes MumpinJ from the bawdy fiJures cavortinJ on the
mediatronic toilet paper to the biJ-eyed  elves playinJ taJ  in the bathroom
mirror to …

       “Oh,  yes,” Finkle-McGraw said. “Can it be written on? , should like to
inscribe it to Eli]abeth.”

       “The  paper is a  subclass of both input-paper and output-paper, so it
possesses all the underlyinJ functionality  of  the sort of  paper you would
write on. For the most part these functions are not used—beyond, of course,
simply makinJ marks where the nib of the pen has moved across it.”

       “You  can write  on it,”  Finkle-McGraw  translated with some asperity,
“but it doesn't think about what you're writinJ.”

       “Well,  my  answer to  that Tuestion must be  ambiJuous,” Hackworth
said. “The ,llustrated Primer  is an extremely Jeneral and powerful  system
capable of more extensive self-reconfiJuration than most. Remember that a
fundamental part of its  Mob is to respond to its environment. ,f  the owner

120
were to take up a pen and write on a blank paJe, this input would be thrown
into the hopper alonJ with everythinJ else, so to speak.”

       “Can ,  inscribe it to Eli]abeth or not?” Finkle-McGraw  demanded.

       “Certainly,  sir.”

       Finkle-McGraw  extracted a heavy Jold fountain pen from a holder on
his desk and wrote in the front of the book for a while.

       “That   beinJ  done, sir,  there  remains  only  for  you   to  authorise a
standinJ purchase order for the ractors.”

       “Ah,  yes, thank you for remindinJ me,”  said Finkle-McGraw, not very
sincerely. “, still  would  have thouJht that for  all the money that went into
this proMect—”

       “That  we miJht have solved the voice-Jeneration problem to boot, yes
sir,” Hackworth said. “As  you know, we  took some stabs at it, but none of
the results were up  to the  level  of Tuality  you  demand. After  all  of  our
technoloJy, the pseudo-intelliJence alJorithms, the vast exception matrices,
the portent and content monitors, and everythinJ else, we  still  can't come
close to JeneratinJ a human voice that sounds as Jood as what a real, live
ractor can Jive us.”

       “Can't  say ,'m surprised, really,”  said Finkle-McGraw.  “,  Must wish it
were a completely self-contained system.”

       “,t  miJht  as well be, sir. At any Jiven time there are tens of millions of
professional ractors in their staJes all over  the world, in  every time  ]one,
ready to take on this kind of work at an instant's notice. We are planninJ to
authorise payment at a relatively hiJh rate, which should brinJ  in only  the
best talent. You won't be disappointed with the results.”


                  Nell's second experience with the Primer; the story
                                   of Princess Nell in a nutshell. 

121

       “What's an adventure?” Nell said.

       The  word was  written  across the paJe. Then both paJes filled   with
movinJ pictures  of  Jlorious  thinJs: Jirls   in  armor fiJhtinJ   draJons with
swords, and  Jirls   ridinJ   white  unicorns  throuJh   the  forest,  and  Jirls
swinJinJ  from  vines, swimminJ  in  the blue  ocean, pilotinJ  rocket  ships
throuJh space. Nell spent a lonJ time lookinJ at all of the pictures, and after
awhile all of the Jirls beJan to look like older versions of herself.

123
                  Judge Fang visits his district;  Miss Pao arranges a
                         demonstration; the case of the stolen book 
                                     takes on unexpected depth. 



As  -udJe   FanJ   proceeded  across  the   Causeway  on  his   chevaline,
accompanied by his assistants, ChanJ and Miss  Pao, he saw the  Leased
Territories  wreathed   in   a  mephitic   foJ.    The  emerald   hiJhlands   of
Atlantis/ShanJhai floated above the  sTualor. A host of  mirrored  aerostats
surrounded that  lofty   territory,  protectinJ  it  from   the  larJer  and  more
obvious sorts of intruders; from here, miles away, the individual pods were
of course not visible,  but they  could be seen in  the aJJreJate as a subtle
Jleam  in  the  air,  a  vast  bubble,  perfectly  transparent, envelopinJ   the
sacrosanct territory of the AnJlo-Americans, stretchinJ this way and that in
the shiftinJ winds but never tearinJ.

       The view was spoiled as they drew closer to the Leased Territories and
entered into their eternal foJs. Several times as they rode throuJh the streets
of the L.T., -udJe FanJ made a peculiar Jesture: He curled the finJers of his
riJht hand into a cylinder, as thouJh JraspinJ an invisible stalk of  bamboo.
He cupped his other hand beneath, forminJ a dark enclosed cavity, and then
peeked into it  with  one eye.  When he stared into  the pocket  of  air thus
formed, he saw the darkness filled with  coruscatinJ liJht—somethinJ  like
starinJ into a cavern filled with fireflies,  except that these liJhts came in all
colors, and all of the colors were as pure and clear as Mewels.

       People  who   lived   in  the   L.T.   and  who  performed   this  Jesture
freTuently developed a  feel  for  what  was  JoinJ  on  in  the microscopic
world.  They   could  tell   when  somethinJ  was  up.  ,f   the  Jesture  was
performed durinJ a toner war, the result was spectacular.

       Today it  was nowhere near toner war levels, but it was fairly  intense.
-udJe FanJ suspected that this had somethinJ to do with the purpose of this
errand, which Miss Pao had declined to explain.

       They ended up in a restaurant. Miss Pao insisted on a table out on the
terrace, even thouJh it  looked  like  rain. They  ended up  overlookinJ  the

124
street three stories below. Even at that distance it was difficult to make out
faces throuJh the foJ.

       Miss  Pao drew  a rectanJular packaJe from  her baJ,  wrapped up in
Nanobar. She unwrapped it and drew out two obMects of rouJhly the same
si]e and shape: a book and a block of wood. She placed them side by side
on the table. Then she iJnored them, turninJ her attention to the menu. She
continued to iJnore them for  several minutes more, as she and ChanJ and
-udJe FanJ  sipped tea, exchanJed polite  chatter, and beJan  to eat  their
meals.

       “At  Your Honor's convenience,” Miss Pao said, “, would invite  you to
examine the two obMects , laid on the table.”

       -udJe  FanJ was startled to  notice that, while  the  block's appearance
had not chanJed, the book had become covered in a layer of thick Jray dust,
as if it had been JrowinJ mildew for several decades.

       “Oooh,”   ChanJ blurted, suckinJ  a lenJthy  skein of  noodles into  his
maw and bulJinJ his eyes in the direction of this peculiar exhibit.

       -udJe FanJ rose, walked around the table, and bent down for a closer
look. The  Jray  dust was  not uniformly   distributed;  it  was much thicker
toward the edJes of the book cover. He opened the book and was startled to
notice that the dust had infiltrated deep between the paJes.

       “This  is dust with a purpose in life,” -udJe FanJ observed.

       Miss  Pao  Jlanced siJnificantly   at  the  block  of  wood.  -udJe  FanJ
picked it up and examined it on all sides; it was clean.

       “This  stuff is discriminatinJ too!”  -udJe FanJ said.

       “,t  is Confucian toner,” ChanJ said, finally  chokinJ down his noodles.
“,t has a passion for books.”

125
       The   -udJe   smiled   tolerantly   and  looked   to   Miss   Pao   for   an
explanation. “You have examined this new species of mite, , take it?”

       “,t  is more interestinJ than that,” Miss Pao said. “Within the last week,
not one but two new species of mite have appeared in the Leased Territories
—both  proJrammed to  seek out  anythinJ  that  looks  like  a book.”   She
reached into her  baJ aJain  and handed her  master a rolled-up  piece  of
mediatronic paper.

       A  waitress scurried up and helped move the dishes and teacups aside.
-udJe FanJ unrolled the paJe and anchored it with  various small items  of
faience. The paper was divided into two panes, each containinJ a maJnified
view of a microscopic device. -udJe FanJ could see that both were made to
naviJate throuJh the air, but beyond that, they could hardly have been more
different. One of them looked  like a work  of nature; it  had several bi]arre
and elaborate arms and sported four enormous, wildly involuted, scooplike
devices, arranJed ninety deJrees apart.

       “The   ears  of  a  bat!”   ChanJ  exclaimed,  tracinJ   their  impossibly
complex whorls with  the  tip of  a chopstick. -udJe  FanJ said nothinJ  but
reminded himself that this  sort of  Tuick insiJht  was Must the sort of thinJ
ChanJ excelled at.

       “,t  appears to use echolocation, like a bat,”  Miss Pao admitted. “The
other one, as you can see, is of a radically different desiJn.”

       The other mite looked like a spacecraft as envisioned by -ules Verne. ,t
had a streamlined, teardrop shape, a pair of manipulator arms folded neatly
aJainst its fuselaJe, and a  deep cylindrical  cavity  in  the nose that -udJe
FanJ took to be its eye. “This one sees liJht in the ultraviolet  ranJe,” Miss
Pao said. “Despite their differences, each does the same thinJ: searches for
books. When it finds a book,  it lands on the cover and crawls to the edJe,
then creeps between the paJes and examines the internal structure of the
paper.”

       “What  is it lookinJ for?”

126
       “There  is no way to  tell, short of  disassemblinJ its internal computer
system and decompilinJ its  proJram—which  is difficult,”    Miss Pao said,
with   characteristic  understatement. “When   it   finds   that   it   has  been
investiJatinJ a normal book made of old-fashioned paper, it deactivates and
becomes dust.”

       “So  there are many dirty books in the Leased Territories now,” ChanJ
said.

       “There  aren't that many books to beJin with,”   -udJe FanJ said. Miss
Pao and ChanJ chuckled, but the -udJe showed no siJn  that he had been
makinJ a Moke; it was Must an observation.

       “What  conclusions do you draw, Miss Pao?” the -udJe said.

       “Two  different parties are searchinJ the Leased Territories for the same
book,” Miss Pao said.

       She did not have to state that the tarJet of this search was probably the
book stolen from the Jentleman named Hackworth.

       “Can you speculate as to the identity of these parties?”

       Miss  Pao said, “Of course, neither device carries a maker's mark. The
bat-eared one has Dr. ; written all  over it; most of its features appear to be
evolved, not enJineered, and the Doctor's Flea Circus is nothinJ more than
an effort to collect evolved mites with useful features. At a first  Jlance, the
other device could have come from any of the enJineerinJ works associated
with maMor phyles—Nippon, New Atlantis, Hindustan, the First Distributed
Republic beinJ prime suspects. But on deeper examination , find a level of
eleJance—”

       “Elegance?”

       “Pardon me, Your Honor,  the concept is not easy to explain—there is
an ineffable   Tuality  to  some  technoloJy,  described by   its  creators  as
concinnitous, or technically sweet, or a nice hack—siJns that it  was made

127
with Jreat care by one who was not merely motivated but inspired. ,t is the
difference between an enJineer and a hacker.”

       “Or  an enJineer and an artifex?” -udJe FanJ said.

       A  trace of a smile came across Miss Pao's face.

       “,  fear that ,  have enmeshed that little Jirl  in a much deeper business
than , ever imaJined,” -udJe FanJ said. He rolled up the paper and handed
it back to Miss Pao. ChanJ set the -udJe's teacup back in front of him and
poured more tea. Without thinkinJ  about  it, the  -udJe put  his thumb and
finJertips  toJether and  tapped them  liJhtly   aJainst the  tabletop  several
times.

       This  was an ancient Jesture in China.  The story was that  one of the
early Emperors liked to  dress as a commoner and travel about the Middle
KinJdom to see how the peasants were JettinJ alonJ. FreTuently, as he and
his staff were  sittinJ  about the table in  some inn,  he would  pour tea for
everyone. They could  not kowtow  to  their  lord without  JivinJ   away his
identity, so they would make this Jesture, usinJ their hand to imitate the act
of kneelinJ. Now  Chinese people used it to thank each other at the dinner
table. From time to time,  -udJe FanJ cauJht himself doinJ  it, and thouJht
about what a  peculiar thinJ  it  was to  be Chinese in  a world  without  an
Emperor.

       He  sat, hands folded into  sleeves, and thouJht  about this  and other
issues for several minutes, watchinJ the vapor rise from  his  tea and form
into a foJ as it condensed round the bodies of micro-aerostats.

       “Soon we will  obtrude upon Mr. Hackworth  and Dr. ;  and learn more
by observinJ their reactions. , will  consider the riJht way  to set about this.
,n the  meantime, let us concern ourselves with  the Jirl.   ChanJ, visit  her
apartment buildinJ  and see whether  there has been any  trouble  there—
suspicious characters hanJinJ about.”

       “Sir,  with  all  respect, everyone who  lives in  the  Jirl's  buildinJ  is  a
suspicious character.”

128
       “You  know  what  ,  mean,” said the  -udJe with  some asperity. “The
buildinJ  should have a system for  filterinJ  nanosites from  the air. ,f  this
system is workinJ properly, and if the Jirl does not take the book out of her
buildinJ, then she should Jo unnoticed by these.” The -udJe drew a streak
throuJh the dust  on the book's  cover and smeared the toner between his
finJers. “Speak with the landlord of her buildinJ,  and let him know that his
air-filterinJ  system is due for an inspection, and that this is Jenuine, not Must
a solicitation for a bribe.”

       “Yes,  sir,”  ChanJ said. He  pushed his chair  back, rose, bowed, and
strode out of  the restaurant, pausinJ only to  extract a toothpick  from  the
dispenser by the exit. ,t  would have been acceptable for him to  finish  his
lunch, but ChanJ had, in the past, evinced concern for the Jirl's welfare, and
apparently wanted to waste no time.

       “Miss  Pao, plant  recordinJ surveillance  devices in the  Jirl's  flat.  At
first  we will   chanJe and review  the tapes every  day. ,f  the  book is  not
detected soon, we will beJin chanJinJ them every week.”

       “Yes,  sir,”   Miss   Pao said.  She  slipped  on  her  phenomenoscopic
spectacles. Colored liJht reflected from the surfaces of her eyes as she lost
herself in some kind of  interface. -udJe FanJ refilled  his tea, cupped it in
the palm of his hand, and went for a stroll round the edJe of the terrace. He
had much more important thinJs to think about than this Jirl and her book;
but he suspected that from now on he would be thinkinJ about little else.


                      Description  of Old Shanghai;  situation of the
                         Theatre Parnasse; Miranda's  occupation. 



Before the Europeans Jot their hooks into  it, ShanJhai had been a walled
villaJe on the HuanJ Pu River, a few miles south of its confluence with the
estuary of the  YanJt]e.  Much  of  the architecture was  very sophisticated
MinJ Dynasty stuff, private Jardens for rich families, a shoppinJ street here
and there concealinJ interior  slums, a rickety,  vertiJinous teahouse risinJ
from an island in the center of a pond. More recently the wall had been torn

129
down  and a  sort  of  beltway  built   on  its  foundations.  The  old  French
concession wrapped around the north side, and in that neiJhborhood, on a
corner lookinJ across the rinJ  road into the old  city, the  Theatre Parnasse
had been constructed durinJ  the late  1800s. Miranda  had been workinJ
there for  five  years, but the experience had been so intense that  it  often
seemed more like five days.

       The  Parnasse had been built   by  Europeans back  when  they were
serious and   unapoloJetic  about  their   Europeanness. The  facade  was
classical: a three-Tuarter-round portico  on the  streetcorner, supported by
Corinthian columns, all done in white limestone. The portico was belted by
a white marTuee, circa 1990, outlined by tubes of purple and pink neon. ,t
would have been easy enouJh to tear it off  and replace it  with somethinJ
mediatronic, but they enMoyed haulinJ the bamboo ladders out from the set
shop and snappinJ the black plastic letters into place, advertisinJ whatever
they were doinJ toniJht.  Sometimes they would lower the biJ mediatronic
screen and show movies, and Westerners would come from all over Greater
ShanJhai, dressed up in their  tuxedos and eveninJ Jowns,  and sit in  the
dark watchinJ  Casablanca or Dances With  Wolves. And at  least twice  a
month, the Parnasse Company would actually Jet out  on staJe and do it:
become actors rather than ractors for  a niJht,  liJhts  and Jreasepaint and
costumes. The hard part was indoctrinatinJ the audience; unless they were
theatre buffs, they always  wanted to run  up on staJe and interact,  which
upset the whole   thinJ.  Live  theatre  was an  ancient and  peculiar  taste,
rouJhly on par with listeninJ to GreJorian chants, and it didn't pay the bills.
They paid the bills with ractives.

       The  buildinJ   was  tall   and  narrow,  makinJ  the  most  of   precious
ShanJhai real estate, so the proscenium had a nearly sTuare aspect ratio,
like an old-fashioned television.  Above it  was the bust  of some forJotten
French actress, supported on  Jilt  winJs,   flanked by  anJels  brandishinJ
trumpets and laurel  wreaths. The ceilinJ  was  a circular  fresco depictinJ
Muses disportinJ themselves in flimsy  robes. A chandelier hunJ  from the
center; its incandescent bulbs had been replaced by new thinJs that didn't
burn out, and now it cast liJht  evenly onto the rows of  tiny, creakinJ seats
closely packed toJether on the main floor. There were three balconies and

130
three stories of private boxes, two on the left side and two on the riJht side
of each level. The fronts of  the boxes and balconies were all painted with
tableaux  from   classical   mytholoJy,   the  predominant   color   there  as
elsewhere beinJ a hiJhly French robin's-eJJ blue. The theatre was crammed
with plasterwork,  so that the faces of cherubs, overwrouJht  Roman Jods,
impassioned TroMans, and such were always pokinJ out  of columns  and
soffits  and cornices, catchinJ  you  by  surprise. Much   of  this  work  was
spalled from  bullets  fired   by  hiJh-spirited  Red  Guards durinJ  Cultural
Revolution times. Other than  the bullet holes, the Parnasse was in decent
shape, thouJh sometime in the twentieth century Jreat black-iron pipes had
been anchored vertically alonJside the  boxes and hori]ontally   before the
balconies so that spotliJhts  could be  bolted on. Nowadays  the spotliJhts
were coin-si]e disks—phased-array devices that carried their own batteries
—and could be stuck up anywhere and controlled  by radio. But  the pipes
were still there and always reTuired a lot of explaininJ when tourists came
throuJh.

       Each of the twelve  boxes had its own door, and a curtain rail curvinJ
around the front so that the occupants could Jet some privacy between acts.
They'd  mothballed   the   curtains  and   replaced  them  with    removable
soundproof screens, unbolted the seats, and stored them in the basement.
Now each box was a private eJJ-shaped room Must the riJht si]e to serve as
a body staJe. These twelve  staJes Jenerated seventy-five percent of  the
cash flow of the Theatre Parnasse.

       Miranda  always checked into  her  staJe half  an hour early  to  run a
diaJnostic on her tat Jrid. The 'sites didn't last forever—static electricity or
cosmic rays could knock them out, and if you let your instrument Jo to pot
out of sheer la]iness, you didn't deserve to call yourself a ractor.

       Miranda  had decorated the dead walls of her own  staJe with posters
and  photos  of   role  models,   larJely  actresses from   twentieth-century
passives. She had a chair in the corner for roles that involved sittinJ down.
There was also a tiny coffee table where she set down her triple latte, a two-
liter bottle of  mineral water, and a box of throat lo]enJes. Then she peeled
down to a black leotard and tiJhts,  hanJinJ her street clothes on a tree by

131
the door. Another ractor miJht have Jone nude, worn street clothes, or tried
to match her costume to the role she'd be playinJ, if she were lucky enouJh
to know in advance. At the moment, thouJh, Miranda never knew. She had
standinJ bids on Kate in the ractive version of Taming of the Shrew (which
was a butcherous kludJe, but popular amonJ a certain sort  of male user);
Scarlett O'Hara in the ractive Gone With the Wind;  a double aJent named
,lse in an espionaJe thriller  set on a train passinJ throuJh Na]i   Germany;
and Rhea, a neo-Victorian damsel in  distress in Silk  Road, an adventure-
comedy-romance ractive set on the wronJ side of contemporary ShanJhai.
She'd created that role. After the Jood review had come in (“a  remarkably
Rhea-listic portrayal by newcomer Miranda Redpath!”) she had played little
else for a couple  of months, even thouJh  her bid  was so steep that most
users opted for   one  of  the  understudies or  contented themselves with
watchinJ passively for one-tenth the price. But the distributor  had botched
the PR tarJetinJ when they tried to take it beyond the ShanJhai market, and
so now Silk Road was in limbo while various heads rolled.

       Four leadinJ roles was about as many as she could keep in her head at
once. The prompter made it possible to play any role without havinJ seen it
before, if  you didn't  mind makinJ  an ass of  yourself. But  Miranda had a
reputation now  and couldn't  Jet  away with  shoddy  work.  To fill   in  the
blanks when thinJs  Jot  slow,  she also had standinJ  bids, under another
name, for easier work:  mostly narration  Mobs, plus anythinJ havinJ to do
with children's  media. She didn't  have any kids  of her  own, but  she still
corresponded with the ones she'd taken care of durinJ her Joverness days.
She loved ractinJ with  children,  and besides it was Jood exercise for  the
voice, sayinJ those silly little rhymes Must riJht.

       “Practice   Kate  from   Shrew,”   she  said,  and  the   Miranda-shaped
constellation was replaced by a dark-haired woman with Jreen, feline eyes,
dressed in some costume desiJner's concept of what a rich woman in  the
,talian Renaissance would be likely to wear. Miranda had larJe bunny eyes
while Kate  had cat eyes, and cat  eyes were used differently  from  bunny
eyes, especially when deliverinJ a slashinJ witticism. Carl  Hollywood,  the
company's founder and dramaturJe, who'd been sittinJ in passively on her
Shrews, had suJJested that she needed more work in this area. Not many

132
payers enMoyed Shakespeare or even knew who he was, but the ones who
did tended  to be  very  hiJh  on the  income scale  and worth  caterinJ  to.
8sually  this  kind of  arJument had  no effect  on Miranda,  but she'd been
findinJ  that  some  of  these  (rich  sexist  snob  asshole) Jentlemen were
remarkably Jood ractors. And any professional could tell you  that it was a
rare pleasure to ract with a payer who knew what he was doinJ.

         

The Shift comprised the Prime Times for  London, the East Coast, and the
West Coast.  ,n   Greenwich  Time,   it   started around  nine   P.M.,  when
Londoners were finishinJ dinner and lookinJ for entertainment, and wound
up about seven A.M., when Californians were JoinJ to bed. No matter what
time ]ones  they  actually lived  in,  all  ractors  tried to  work  durinJ  those
hours. ,n  ShanJhai's time ]one,   The Shift  ran  from  about five   A.M.  to
midafternoon, and Miranda didn't mind doinJ overtime if some well-heeled
Californian  wanted to  stretch a  ractive late  into  the niJht.  Some  of  the
ractors in her company didn't come in until later in the day, but Miranda still
had dreams of   livinJ   in  London  and  craved attention  from   that  city's
sophisticated payers. So she always came to work early.

       When she finished her warmups and went on, she found a bid already
waitinJ for  her. The castinJ aJent, which  was a semiautonomous piece of
software, had assembled a company of nine payers, enouJh to ract all the
Juest roles in First Class to Geneva, which was about intriJue amonJ rich
people on a train in Na]i-occupied France, and which was to ractives what
The Mousetrap was to passive theatre. ,t was an ensemble piece: nine Juest
roles to be assumed by payers, three somewhat larJer and more Jlamorous
host roles to be assumed by payees like Miranda. One of the characters was,
unbeknownst to the others, an Allied spy. Another  was a secret colonel in
the SS, another was secretly -ewish, another was a Cheka aJent. Sometimes
there was a German tryinJ to defect to the Allied side. But you never knew
which was which when the ractive started up; the computer switched all the
roles around at random.

133
       ,t    paid   well   because  of   the   hiJh   payer/payee  ratio.   Miranda
provisionally accepted the bid. One of the other host roles hadn't been filled
yet, so  while  she waited,  she  bid  and won  a  filler   Mob. The computer
morphed her into the face of an adorable younJ woman whose face and hair
looked typical of what was current in London  at the moment; she wore the
uniform of a British  Airways  ticket aJent. “Good eveninJ, Mr.  Oremland,”
she Jushed, readinJ the  prompter. The  computer disped it  into  an  even
perkier voice and made subtle corrections in her accent.

       “Good  eveninJ, er, MarJaret,” said the Mowly Brit starinJ out of a pane
on her mediatron. He was wearinJ half-Jlasses, had to sTuint to make out
her nametaJ. His tie was loose on his chest, a Jin and tonic in one hairy fist,
and he liked the looks of this MarJaret. Which was almost Juaranteed, since
MarJaret had been morphed up by  a marketinJ computer in  London  that
knew more about this  Jentleman's taste in Jirlflesh  than he would like  to
think.

       “Six   months without   a vacation!?  How  borinJ,”   Miranda/MarJaret
said. “You  must be  doinJ  somethinJ terribly   important,”  she continued,
facetious without beinJ mean, the two of them sharinJ a little Moke.

       “Yes, , suppose even makinJ lots of money does become borinJ after a
while,” the man returned, in much the same tone.

       Miranda  Jlanced over at the castinJ sheet for  First Class to  Geneva.
She'd be pissed if this Mr. Oremland Jot overly talkative  and forced her to
pass on the biJJer role. ThouJh he did seem a reasonably clever sort. “You
know, it's a  fine time  to visit  Atlantan  West Africa,  and the airship  Gold
Coast is scheduled to depart in  two weeks—shall ,  book  a stateroom for
you? And a companion perhaps?”

       Mr.  Oremland  seemed iffy.  “Call   me old-fashioned,”  he  said, “but
when you say Africa, , think A,DS and parasites.”

       “Oh,  not in West Africa, sir, not in the new colonies. Would you like a
Tuick tour?”

134
       Mr. Oremland Jave Miranda/MarJaret one lonJ, searchinJ, horny look,
siJhed, checked  his  watch, and  seemed to  remember that  she  was an
imaJinary beinJ. “Thank you Must the same,” he said, and cut her off.

       -ust  in time  too;  the playbill  for  Geneva had Must filled up. Miranda
only had a few seconds to switch contexts and Jet herself into the character
of  ,lse before  she found  herself sittinJ   in  a first-class  coach of  a  mid-
twentieth-century passenJer train, starinJ into the mirror  at a blond,  blue-
eyed, hiJh-cheekboned ice Tueen. 8nfolded  on  her dressinJ-table was  a
letter written in Yiddish.

       So toniJht  she was the secret -ew. She tore the letter into tiny  pieces
and fed them out her window, then did  the same with a couple of Stars of
David that she rooted out of her Mewelry case. This thinJ was fully ractive,
and there was nothinJ to  prevent other characters from breakinJ  into her
coach and JoinJ throuJh her possessions. Then she finished puttinJ on her
makeup and choosinJ her outfit, and went to the dininJ car for dinner. Most
of the other characters were already in here. The nine amateurs were stiff
and stilted as  usual, the two  other  professionals were circulatinJ  amonJ
them, tryinJ to  loosen them up, break throuJh that self-consciousness and
Jet them into their characters.

       Geneva ended up draJJinJ  on for  a Jood  three hours. ,t  was nearly
ruined by one of the payers, who had clearly siJned up exclusively for  the
purpose of maneuverinJ ,lse  into bed. He  turned out to  be the secret SS
colonel too; but he was so hell-bent on fuckinJ ,lse that he spent the whole
eveninJ out of character. Finally Miranda lured him  into the kitchen in  the
back of the dininJ car, shoved a foot-lonJ butcher knife  into his chest, and
left him  in the fridJe.  She had played this role  a couple of hundred times
and knew the location of every potentially lethal obMect on the train.

       After  a ractive it was considered Jood form to Jo to the Green Room, a
virtual  pub where you  could chat out-of-character with  the  other ractors.
Miranda skipped it  because she knew that the creep would be waitinJ for
her there.

135
       Next  was a lull of  an hour or so. Primetime in  London was over, and
New Yorkers were still eatinJ dinner. Miranda  went to the bathroom, ate a
little snack, and picked up a few kiddy Mobs.

       Kids  on the West Coast were JettinJ  back from  school and MumpinJ
riJht  into   the hiJh-priced   educational ractives  that  their  parents  made
available to them. These thinJs created a plethora of extremely short but fun
roles; in  Tuick  succession, Miranda's face  was morphed  into  a duck,  a
bunny, a  talkinJ   tree, the  eternally  elusive  Carmen SandieJo,  and  the
repulsively cloyinJ DooJie the Dinosaur. Each of them Jot a couple of lines
at most:

       “That's  riJht!  B stands for balloon!  , like  to play  with balloons, don't
you, Matthew?”

       “Sound it out, Victoria!  You can do it!”

       “Soldier   ants   have  larJer   and  stronJer  Maws than  their   worker
counterparts and play a key role in defendinJ the nest from predators.”

       “Please don't throw me into that briar patch, Br'er Fox!”

       “Hello,   Roberta! ,'ve been missinJ  you all  day. How  was your  field
trip to Disneyland?”

       “Twentieth-century   airships were  filled   with   flammable  hydroJen,
expensive helium, or inefficient  hot air, but our modern versions are filled
literally  with nothinJ  at all.  HiJh-strenJth nanostructures make it possible
to pump all  the air  from  an airship's envelope and fill   it  with  a vacuum.
Have you ever been on an airship, Thomas?”


                        Nell's  further  experiences with the Primer;
                                     the origin  of Princess Nell. 

136
“Once  upon  a  time  there  was  a little   Princess  named Nell   who  was
imprisoned in a tall dark castle on an island—”

       “Why?”

       “Nell   and Harv had been locked  up in  the Dark Castle by  their evil
stepmother.”

       “Why  didn't their father let them out of the Dark Castle?”

       “Their  father, who had protected them from  the whims of the wicked
stepmother, had Jone sailinJ over the sea and never come back.”

       “Why  did he never come back?”

       “Their  father was a fisherman. He went out on his boat every day. The
sea is a vast and danJerous place, filled with  monsters, storms, and other
danJers. No one knows what fate befell him. Perhaps it was foolish of him
to sail into  such danJer, but Nell  knew better than to  fret over thinJs  she
could not chanJe.”

       “Why  did she have a wicked stepmother?”

       “Nell's  mother died one niJht when a monster came out of the sea and
entered their cottaJe to snatch Nell  and Harv,  who were Must babies. She
fouJht  with  the monster  and slew  it,  but  in  so doinJ  suffered Jrievous
wounds and died the next day with her adopted children still nestled in her
bosom.”

       “Why  did the monster come from the sea?”

       “For  many years, Nell's father  and mother badly wanted children but
were not so blessed until one day, when the father cauJht a mermaid in his
net. The mermaid said that if he let her Jo, she would Jrant him a wish, so
he wished for two children, a boy and a Jirl.

137
       “The  next  day, while  he  was out  fishinJ,  he  was approached by a
mermaid carryinJ a basket. ,n the basket were the two little babies, Must as
he had reTuested, wrapped up in cloth of Jold. The mermaid cautioned him
that he and his wife should not allow the babies to cry at niJht.”

       “Why  were they in Jold cloth?”

       “They   were actually   a Princess and  a  Prince who   had been  in  a
shipwreck. The ship sank, but the basket containinJ the two babies bobbed
like a  cork on the  ocean until the  mermaids came and found them. They
took care of those two babies until they found a Jood parent for them.

       “He  took the babies back to the cottaJe and presented them to his wife,
who swooned  for  Moy. They lived  happily  toJether  for  some time,  and
whenever one of  the babies cried,  one of  the parents would  Jet  up and
comfort it.  But one niJht  father did  not come home, because a storm had
pushed his little red fishinJ boat far  out to sea. One of the babies beJan to
cry, and the mother Jot up to comfort it. But when the other beJan to cry as
well, there was nothinJ she could do, and shortly the monster came callinJ.

       “When  the fisherman returned home the next day, he found his wife's
body lyinJ beside that of the monster, and both of the babies unharmed. His
Jrief  was very  Jreat, and he  beJan the difficult   task of  raisinJ  both  the
children.

       “One  day, a stranJer came to his door. She said that she had been cast
out by the cruel KinJs and 4ueens of the Land Beyond and that she needed
a place to sleep and would do any kind  of  work in  exchanJe. At first  she
slept on the floor and cooked and cleaned for the fisherman all day lonJ, but
as Nell and Harv Jot biJJer, she beJan to Jive them more and more chores,
until by the time their  father disappeared, they toiled from dawn until lonJ
after niJhtfall, while their stepmother never lifted a finJer.”

       “Why  didn't  the fisherman and his babies live in  the castle to protect
them from the monster?”

138
       “The  castle was a dark forbiddinJ place on the top of a mountain. The
fisherman had been told by his father that it had been built many aJes aJo
by trolls, who  were still said to  live there. And he did  not have the twelve
keys.”

       “Did  the wicked stepmother have the twelve keys?”

       “She kept  them buried in a secret place as lonJ as the fisherman was
around, but after he sailed away and did not come back, she had Nell and
Harv diJ them up  aJain, alonJ with  a Tuantity of Mewels and Jold that she
had brouJht with her from the Land Beyond. She bedecked herself with the
Jold  and Mewels, then opened up the iron  Jates of  the Dark  Castle and
tricked Nell   and Harv  into  JoinJ  inside.  As  soon as  they were  in,  she
slammed the Jates shut behind them and locked the twelve locks.  “When
the sun Joes down, the trolls will have you for a snack!' she cackled.”

       “What's a troll?”

       “A  scary monster that lives in holes in the Jround and comes out after
dark.”

       Nell  started  to cry.  She slammed the  book  closed, ran  to her  bed,
Jathered her stuffed animals up in her arms, started chewinJ on her blanket,
and cried for a while, considerinJ the Tuestion of trolls.

       The book made a flutterinJ sound. Nell saw it openinJ in the corner of
her eye and looked over cautiously, afraid she miJht see a picture of a troll.
But instead, she saw two pictures. One was of Princess Nell, sittinJ on the
Jrass with four dolls  Jathered in her arms. FacinJ it  was a picture of Nell
surrounded by four creatures: a biJ dinosaur, a rabbit, a duck, and a woman
in a purple dress with purple hair.

       The book said, “Would you like  to hear the story of how Princess Nell
made some friends in the Dark Castle, where she least expected it, and how
they killed all of the trolls and made it a safe place to live?”

139
       “Yes!”   Nell  said, and scooted across the floor  until  she was  poised
above the book.


                   Judge Fang pays a visit to the Celestial Kingdom;
                        tea served in an ancient setting; a “chance” 
                                         encounter with  Dr. X. 



JudJe FanJ was not afflicted with the Westerner's inability to pronounce the
name of the man known as Dr. ;,  unless a combined Cantonese/New York
accent counted as a speech impediment. ,n his discussions with his trusted
subordinates he had fallen into the habit of callinJ him Dr. ; anyway.

       He  had never had cause to pronounce the name at all, until  recently.
-udJe FanJ was district maJistrate for the Leased Territories, which in turn
were part of  the  Chinese Coastal Republic.  Dr. ;    almost never  left  the
boundaries of Old ShanJhai, which was part of a separate district; more to
the point, he stuck to a small but anfractuous subreJion whose tendrils were
seeminJly ramified throuJh every block and buildinJ of the ancient city. On
the map, this  reJion  looked like   the root  system of  a thousand-year-old
dwarf  tree; its  border must  have been a  hundred kilometers  lonJ,  even
thouJh it was contained within  a couple of  sTuare kilometers. This reJion
was not part of the Coastal Republic; it styled itself as the Middle KinJdom,
a livinJ   vestiJe of  ,mperial  China,  prohibitively   the oldest  and Jreatest
nation of the world.

       The tendrils  went even farther than that;  -udJe FanJ had known this
for a  lonJ  time. Many  of  the JanJ  members runninJ  around the Leased
Territories with -udJe FanJ's cane marks across their asses had connections
on the mainland that could ultimately be traced back to Dr. ;.  ,t was rarely
useful to dwell  upon this fact;  if  it hadn't been Dr. ;,   it  would  have been
someone else. Dr.  ;    was  unusually clever  at  takinJ   advantaJe of  the
principle of  Jrith,  or  riJht  of  refuJe, which  in  the  modern usaJe simply
meant that Coastal Republic officials  like  -udJe FanJ could  not enter the
Celestial KinJdom  and arrest someone like Dr.  ;.   So usually  when they
bothered to trace a criminal's hiJher connections at all, they simply drew an

140
arrow up the paJe to a sinJle character, consistinJ of a box with  a vertical
slash drawn down throuJh the middle.  The character meant Middle, as in
Middle  KinJdom,  thouJh  for  -udJe  FanJ it  had  come to  mean, simply,
trouble.

       At  the House of the Venerable and ,nscrutable Colonel and other -udJe
FanJ hanJouts, the name of Dr. ; had been pronounced more freTuently in
recent weeks. Dr. ;  had tried to  bribe everyone on -udJe FanJ's hierarchy
except for the -udJe  himself. Of  course, the overtures had been made by
people whose connection with Dr. ;   was tenuous in the extreme, and had
been so subtle that most of  those approached had not even reali]ed what
was happeninJ until, days or weeks later, they had suddenly sat up in bed
exclaiminJ, “He was tryinJ to bribe me! ,  must tell -udJe FanJ!”

       ,f   not for  Jrith,   this miJht  have  made for  a merry  and stimulatinJ
couple of  decades, as -udJe FanJ matched his  wits aJainst  those of  the
Doctor, a  worthy  adversary  at last  and  a welcome  break  from  smelly,
larcenous barbarian whelps. As it was, Dr. ;'s machinations were of purely
abstract interest. But they were no less interestinJ for that, and many days,
as Miss Pao proceeded throuJh the familiar line  of  patter about sky-eyes,
heuristic muJJinJ  detection,  and taJJer aerostats, -udJe  FanJ found  his
attention wanderinJ across town to the ancient city, to the honJ of Dr. ;.

       ,t  was said that the Doctor freTuently took tea in the morninJ at an old
teahouse there, and so it was  that one morninJ  -udJe  FanJ happened to
drop in on the place. ,t had been built, centuries aJo, in the center of a pond.
Swarms of  fire-colored  fish  hunJ  Must beneath the surface of the  khaki
water, JlowinJ like  latent coals, as -udJe FanJ and his assistants, Miss Pao
and ChanJ, crossed the bridJe.

       There was a Chinese belief that demons liked to travel only in straiJht
lines. Hence the bridJe ]iJ]aJJed   no fewer than nine  times as it made its
way to  the center  of  the pond. The  bridJe  was a demon  filter,  in  other
words,  and  the  teahouse demon-free,  which   seemed of   only   limited
usefulness if it still hosted people like Dr. ;.  But for -udJe FanJ, raised in a
city of  lonJ  straiJht  avenues, full  of straiJht  talkers, it  was  useful to  be

141
reminded that from the point of view of some people, includinJ Dr. ;, all  of
that straiJhtness was suJJestive of demonism; more natural and human was
the ever-turninJ way, where you could never see round the next corner, and
the overall plan could be understood only after lenJthy meditation.

       The teahouse itself was constructed of unfinished wood, aJed to a nice
Jray. ,t  looked  rickety  but evidently  wasn't. ,t  was narrow  and tall,  two
stories hiJh with a proud winJlike  roof. One entered throuJh a low narrow
door, built by and for  the chronically  undernourished. The interior had the
ambience of a rustic cabin on a lake. -udJe FanJ had been here before, in
mufti, but today he had thrown a robe over his charcoal-Jray pinstripe suit
—a reasonably subtle brocade, funereal by comparison with  what  people
used to  wear in  China.  He  also wore  a  black  cap embroidered with   a
unicorn,  which  in   most company  would   probably  be  lumped  in  with
rainbows and  elves but  here would  be  understood for  what  it   was, an
ancient symbol of acuity. Dr. ;  could be relied upon to Jet the messaJe.

       The teahouse staff had had plenty of time to reali]e he was cominJ as
he neJotiated the endless turns in the causeway. A manaJer of sorts and a
couple of  waitresses were arrayed before the door, bowinJ  deeply  as he
approached.

       -udJe FanJ had been raised on Cheerios, burJers, and Mumbo burritos
bulJinJ  with  beans and meat. He was Must a bit less than two  meters in
heiJht. His beard was unusually thick, and he had been lettinJ it  Jrow out
for  a couple  of  years now,  and his  hair  fell  down  past  the tips  of  his
shoulder blades. These elements, plus the hat and robe, and in combination
with the power reposed in him by the state, Jave him a certain presence of
which he was well aware. He tried  not to be overly  satisfied with himself,
as this would have Jone aJainst all Confucian precepts. On the other hand,
Confucianism was all about hierarchy, and those who were in hiJh positions
were supposed to comport themselves with a  certain diJnity.  -udJe FanJ
could turn it on when he needed to. He used it now to Jet himself situated at
the best table on the first  floor, off  in  the corner with  a nice view out  the
tiny old windows  into the neiJhborinJ MinJ-era  Jarden. He was still in the
Coastal Republic, in the  middle of  the twenty-first  century. But  he could

142
have been in the Middle KinJdom of yore, and for all intents and purposes,
he was.

       ChanJ  and  Miss  Pao separated themselves from  their   master and
reTuested a table on the second floor, up a narrow and alarminJ stairway,
leavinJ -udJe  FanJ  in  peace whilst  also makinJ  their  presence forcibly
known to Dr. ;,   who happened to be up there riJht now, as he always was
at this  time in  the  morninJ,  sippinJ tea  and chattinJ  with  his venerable
homeboys.

       When Dr. ;   made his way down half an hour later, he was nonetheless
deliJhted and surprised to see the moderately famous and widely respected
-udJe FanJ sittinJ all by his lonesome starinJ out at the pond, its schools of
fish  flickerinJ   lambently.  When he  approached the  table  to  tender his
respects, -udJe FanJ invited him to take a seat, and after several minutes of
sensitive neJotiations   over  whether  this   would   or  would   not   be  an
unforJivable intrusion on the maJistrate's privacy, Dr. ;   finally,  Jratefully,
reluctantly, respectfully took a seat.

       There was lenJthy  discourse between the two men on which of them
was more  honored  to   be  in  the  company  of   the  other,  followed   by
exhaustive discussion of the relative merits of the different teas offered by
the proprietors, whether the leaves were best picked in early or late April,
whether the  brewinJ  water  should  be  violently  boilinJ   as  the pathetic
gwailos always did it, or limited to eiJhty deJrees Celsius.

       Eventually, Dr. ;   Jot around to complimentinJ -udJe FanJ on his cap,
especially on  the embroidery  work.  This  meant that he  had noticed  the
unicorn and understood its messaJe, which was that -udJe FanJ had seen
throuJh all of his efforts at bribery.

       Not lonJ  afterward, Miss Pao came down and reJretfully informed the
-udJe that his presence was urJently reTuired at a crime scene in the Leased
Territories. To spare -udJe FanJ the embarrassment of havinJ to cut short
the conversation, Dr. ;  was approached, moments later, by one of his staff,
who whispered somethinJ into his ear. The Doctor apoloJi]ed for havinJ to

143
take his leave, and the two men then Jot into a very Jenteel arJument over
which one of them was beinJ more inexcusably rude, and then over which
would precede the other across the bridJe. -udJe FanJ ended up JoinJ first,
because his duties were deemed more pressinJ, and thus  ended the first
meetinJ between the -udJe and Dr. ;. The -udJe was Tuite happy; it had all
Jone Must as planned.


                           Hackworth  receives an unexpected visit
                                        from  Inspector Chang. 



Mrs.  Hull  had to  shake the  flour  out  of  her  apron to  answer the  door.
Hackworth, workinJ  in his study, assumed it was a mere delivery until she
appeared in his doorway, harrumphinJ liJhtly, holdinJ a salver with a sinJle
card centered on  it:  Lieutenant  ChanJ.  His  orJani]ation  was  called,  in
traditional   Chinese  Jeneral-to-specific  order,  China   Coastal  Republic
ShanJhai New Chusan Leased Territories District MaJistrate Office.

       “What  does he want?”

       “To  Jive you your hat back.”

       “Send him in,”  Hackworth said, startled.

       Mrs.  Hull dawdled siJnificantly.  Hackworth Jlanced into a mirror  and
saw himself reachinJ for  his throat, checkinJ the  knot on his  necktie. His
smokinJ Macket was hanJinJ loose, and he wrapped it tiJht and retied the
sash. Then he went to the parlor.

       Mrs.  Hull   led  Lieutenant  ChanJ  into  the  parlor.  He  was a  burly,
unJainly fellow  with  a short bu]]  cut.  Hackworth's top hat, lookinJ  rather
ill-used, could be seen indistinctly  throuJh a larJe  plastic baJ clenched in
his hand. “Lieutenant ChanJ,” Mrs.  Hull  announced, and ChanJ bowed at
Hackworth, smilinJ  a bit  more than seemed warranted. Hackworth bowed
back. “Lieutenant ChanJ.”

144
       “,  will   not disturb  you for  lonJ,  , promise,”  ChanJ said in  clear but
unrefined EnJlish. “DurinJ  an investiJation—details not relevant here—we
Jot this  from  a suspect. ,t  is marked your  property. Much  the worse for
wear—please accept it.”

       “Well   done,  Lieutenant,”   said  Hackworth,  receivinJ   the  baJ  and
holdinJ it  up to the liJht.  “,  did  not expect to see it  aJain, even in such a
battered condition.”

       “Well,  these boys do not have respect for a Jood hat, , am afraid,” said
Lieutenant ChanJ.

       Hackworth  paused, not knowinJ what one was supposed to say at this
point. ChanJ Must stood there, seeminJ more at ease in Hackworth's parlor
than Hackworth  was. The  first  exchanJe had been simple,  but  now  the
East/West curtain fell between them like a rusty cleaver.

       Was this part of some official procedure? Was it a solicitation for a tip?
Or Must Mr. ChanJ beinJ a nice Juy?

       When  in  doubt, end  the visit   sooner rather than later.  “Well,”   said
Hackworth, “,  don't know  and don't care what you  arrested him for, but ,
commend you for havinJ done so.”

       Lieutenant ChanJ did not Jet the hint  and reali]e it  was time to leave.
On  the  contrary,  he  seemed Must a bit   perplexed  now,  where  before
everythinJ had been so simple.

       “,   cannot help beinJ curious,”  ChanJ said, “what  Jave  you the idea
that anyone had been arrested?”

       Hackworth felt  a spear pass throuJh his heart.

       “You're  a police  lieutenant holdinJ   what appears to be  an evidence
baJ,” he said. “The implication is clear.”

145
       Lieutenant   ChanJ    looked   at    the   baJ,   laboriously    perplexed.
“Evidence? ,t is Must a shoppinJ baJ—to protect your hat from the rain. And
, am not here in my official capacity.”

       Another spear, at riJht anJles to the first one.

       “ThouJh,”  ChanJ continued, “if  some criminal activity has taken place
of which , was not made aware, perhaps , should recharacteri]e this visit.”

       Spear number three; now Hackworth's poundinJ heart sat at the oriJin
of a bloody  coordinate system plotted by Lieutenant  ChanJ, conveniently
pinned and exposed for thorouJh examination. ChanJ's EnJlish was JettinJ
better all the time, and Hackworth was beJinninJ  to think that  he was one
of those ShanJhainese who had spent much of his life in Vancouver, New
York, or London.

       “,  had assumed that the Jentleman's hat had simply been misplaced or
perhaps blown  off   by  a  Just  of   wind.  Now   you  say  criminals   were
involved!”  ChanJ looked as thouJh he had never, to this day, suspected the
existence  of   criminals   in   the   Leased  Territories.   Then   shock  was
transcended by wonder as he seJued, none too subtly, into the next phase of
the trap.

       “,t   was  not  important,”   Hackworth  said,  tryinJ   to  derail  ChanJ's
relentless train of thouJht, sensinJ that he and his  family  were tied to the
tracks. ChanJ iJnored him, as if so exhilarated by the workinJs of his mind
that he could not be distracted.

       “Mr.   Hackworth, you  have Jiven  me an idea. ,  have been tryinJ   to
solve a difficult   case—a muJJinJ   that took  place a  few  days aJo.  The
victim was an unidentified Atlantan Jentleman.”

       “Don't  you have taJ mites for that kind of thinJ?”

       “Oh,”  Lieutenant ChanJ said, soundinJ rather downhearted, “taJ mites
are not very reliable.  The perpetrators took certain precautions to prevent
the mites from  attachinJ. Of course, several mites attached themselves to

146
the victim. But before we could track him, he made his way to New Atlantis
Clave, where your  superb immune system destroyed those mites.  So his
identity has remained a mystery.” ChanJ reached into his breast pocket and
pulled out a folded sheet of paper. “Mr. Hackworth, please tell me whether
you recoJni]e any of the fiJures in this clip.”

       “,'m  actually  rather busy—” Hackworth  said, but ChanJ unfolded the
paper in front of him  and Jave it a command in ShanJhainese. ,nitially the
paJe was covered with static Chinese characters. Then a larJe panel in the
middle opened up and beJan to play back a cine feed.

       WatchinJ  himself  JettinJ  muJJed  was one of  the  most astonishinJ
thinJs Hackworth had ever seen. He could not  stop watchinJ it.  The feed
went  to  slow   motion,  and  then   out  came  the  book.  Tears  came  to
Hackworth's eyes, and he made an effort not to blink lest he dislodJe them.
Not that  it  really  mattered, since  Lieutenant ChanJ  was standinJ rather
close to him and could no doubt see everythinJ.

       ChanJ  was shakinJ  his  head in  wonderment. “So  it  was  you,  Mr.
Hackworth. , had not made the connection. So many nice thinJs, and such a
vicious beatinJ. You have been the victim of a very serious crime!”

       Hackworth could not speak and had nothinJ to say anyway.

       “,t   is strikinJ  to  me,”  ChanJ continued, “that  you did  not  bother to
report this serious crime  to  the maJistrate! For  some time now  we  have
been reviewinJ   this   tape,  wonderinJ   why   the  victim—a    respectable
Jentleman—did not step forward  to assist us with our  inTuiries. So much
effort wasted,”  ChanJ fretted.  Then he briJhtened up.  “But  it's  all  water
under the bridJe, , suppose. We have one or two of the JanJ in custody, on
an unrelated crime, and now , can charJe them with your muJJinJ as well.
Of course, we will reTuire your testimony.”

       “Of  course.”

       “The items that were taken from you?”

147
       “You  saw it.”

       “Yes. A watch chain with various items, a fountain pen, and—”

       “That's it.”

       ChanJ  seemed Must a bit nonplussed, but more than that he seemed
deeply satisfied, suffused by a newly  Jenerous spirit. “The book  does not
even bear mentioninJ?”

       “Not  really.”

       “,t  looked like an antiTue of some sort. 4uite valuable, no?”

       “A   fake. That  sort  of  thinJ  is popular  with  us. A   way to  build  an
impressive-seeminJ library without JoinJ broke.”

       “Ah,  that explains it,”  said Mr.  ChanJ, JrowinJ  more satisfied by the
minute. ,f Hackworth  provided him any more reassurance on the matter of
the book, he would  no doubt curl  up on  the sofa and fall  asleep. “Still,  ,
should mention the book in my  official  report—which will   be shared with
New Atlantis authorities, as the victim in this case belonJed to that phyle.”

       “Don't,”   said Hackworth, finally  turninJ  to look ChanJ in  the eye for
the first time. “Don't mention it.”

       “Ah,  , cannot imaJine your motive for  sayinJ this,” ChanJ said, “but ,
have  little   leeway  in   the  matter.  We  are   closely  monitored   by  our
supervisors.”

       “Perhaps you could simply explain my feelinJs to your supervisor.”

       Lieutenant ChanJ received this suJJestion with a look of wild surmise.
“Mr. Hackworth,  you are a very clever fellow— as , already Jathered from
your demandinJ and very  responsible position—but ,  am ashamed to tell
you that your  excellently devious plan  may not work.  My  supervisor is a
cruel taskmaster with no reJard for human feelinJs. To be Tuite frank—and

148
,  tell   you   this  in   all   confidence—he is   not  entirely   without   ethical
blemishes.”

       “Ah,”  Hackworth  said, “so if , am followinJ  you—”

       “Oh,  no, Mr. Hackworth, it is , who am followinJ  you.”

       “—the  appeal to sympathy won't work, and we will  have to sway him
usinJ another strateJy, perhaps related to this ethical blind spot.”

       “That  is an approach that had not occurred to me.”

       “Perhaps you should do  some thinkinJ, or  even some research, as to
what level  and type  of inducement miJht   be reTuired,”  Hackworth said,
suddenly walkinJ toward the exit. Lieutenant ChanJ followed him.

       Hackworth  hauled his front door  open and allowed ChanJ to retrieve
his own hat and umbrella from the rack. “Then  simply Jet back to  me and
spell  it  out   as plainly   and  simply   as  you  can  manaJe.  Good  niJht,
Lieutenant ChanJ.”

       As  he rode his bicycle toward the Jate on his way back to the Leased
Territories, ChanJ was exultant over  the success of toniJht's research. Of
course, neither he nor -udJe FanJ was interested in extractinJ bribes from
this Hackworth; but Hackworth's willinJness to pay served as proof that the
book did, in fact, embody stolen intellectual property.

       But  then  he  bridled  his  emotions,  rememberinJ the  words  of  the
philosopher TsanJ  to  YanJ  Fu  upon  the  latter's  appointment  to  chief
criminal  MudJe: “The rulers  have failed  in   their  duties, and  the people
conseTuently have been disorJani]ed for a lonJ time. When you have found
out the truth of any accusation, be Jrieved for and pity them, and do not feel
Moy at your own ability.”

       Not  that ChanJ's abilities had even been tested this eveninJ; nothinJ
could be  easier than JettinJ  the  New  Atlantans to  believe  that Chinese
police were corrupt.

                  Miranda  takes an interest in an anonymous client.


Miranda scanned her balance sheet at the end of one month and discovered
that her leadinJ source of income was no lonJer Silk Road or Taming of the
Shrew—it was  that  storybook about  Princess Nell.   ,n  a  way  that  was
surprisinJ, because kid stuff usually didn't  pay well,  but in another way  it
wasn't—because she had been spendinJ an incredible amount of time in that
ractive lately.

       ,t  had started small: a story, Must a few minutes lonJ, involvinJ a dark
castle, a wicked stepmother, and a Jate with  twelve locks.  ,t  would have
been forJettable, except for two thinJs:  ,t  paid much better than most kid
work, because they were specifically lookinJ for hiJhly rated actresses, and
it was rather dark  and weird  by the  standards of contemporary children's
literature. Not  many people were  into that  whole  Grimm  Brothers scene
anymore.

       She collected a few  ucus for  her trouble and forJot  about it. But  the
next day, the same contract number came up on her mediatron aJain. She
accepted the Mob and found herself readinJ the same story, except that it was
lonJer and more involved, and it kept backtrackinJ and focusinJ in on tiny
little bits of itself, which  then expanded into stories in their own riJht.

       Because of  the way  that  the ractive  was hooked up,  she didn't  Jet
direct feedback from her counterpart on the other end. She assumed it was a
little Jirl.  But she couldn't hear the Jirl's voice. Miranda was presented with
screens of text to be read, and she read them. But she could tell  that this
process of probinJ  and focusinJ was  beinJ directed by  the Jirl.  She had
seen this durinJ her Joverness days. She knew that on the other end of this
connection was a little Jirl insatiably askinJ why. So she put a little Jush of
enthusiasm into her  voice at  the beJinninJ  of  each line,  as if   she were
deliJhted that the Tuestion had been asked.

       When the session was over, the usual screen came up tellinJ her how
much she'd made, the contract number, and so on. Before she siJned off on

150
it,  she checked the little  box  labelled  MARK   HERE  ,F  YO8  WO8LD
L,KE A  CONT,N8,NG   RELAT,ONSH,P  W,TH TH,S  CONTRACT.

       The relationship box,  they called it,  and it only  came up with hiJher-
Tuality  ractives,  where  continuity  was  important.  The  dispinJ   process
worked so well   that any ractor,  male or  female, bass or soprano, would
sound the same to  the  end user. But  discriminatinJ  customers could  of
course tell ractors apart anyway because of subtle differences in style, and
once they had a relationship with one performer, they liked to keep it. Once
Miranda checked the box and siJned off, she'd Jet first  crack at any more
Princess Nell Mobs.

       Within  a week she was teachinJ this Jirl how to read. They'd work on
letters for a while and then wander off into more stories about Princess Nell,
stop in the middle for a Tuick practical demonstration of basic math, return
to the story, and then Jet sidetracked with an endless chain of “why this?”
and “why that?” Miranda  had spent a lot of time with  kiddie ractives, both
as a child and as a Joverness, and the superiority of this thinJ was palpable
—like  heftinJ  an antiTue silver fork  when you'd  been eatinJ with  plastic
utensils for  twenty  years, or  slitherinJ  into  a tailor-made  eveninJ Jown
when you were used to Means.

       These and other associations came into Miranda's mind on any of the
rare moments when she came into contact with somethinJ of 4uality, and if
she didn't make a conscious effort  to stop the process, she would end up
rememberinJ Must about everythinJ that had happened to her durinJ the first
years of her  life—the  Mercedes takinJ  her to  private school,  the crystal
chandelier that would rinJ like fairy  bells when she climbed up on the huJe
mahoJany dinner table  to  tickle  it,  her paneled bedroom  with  the four-
poster bed with the silk-and-Joosedown duvet. For reasons still unspecified,
Mother had moved  them far  away from  all  of that,  into what  passed for
poverty these days. Miranda  only  remembered that, when  she had been
physically close to Father, Mother  had watched them with more viJilance
than seemed warranted.

151
       A  month  or  two  into  the relationship,  Miranda  JroJJily  siJned  off
from a lonJ  Princess Nell  session and was astounded to notice that she'd
been JoinJ for  eiJht  hours without  a break. Her throat  was raw, and she
hadn't been to the loo in hours. She had made a lot of money. And the time
in New York  was somethinJ like  six in  the morninJ,  which made it  seem
unlikely that the little  Jirl lived  there. She must be in a time ]one not many
hours different  from  Miranda's, and she must  sit there playinJ  with   that
ractive storybook all day lonJ instead of JoinJ to school like a little rich Jirl
should. ,t  was slim  evidence to  Jo on,  but Miranda  never needed much
evidence to confirm  her  belief  that rich  parents were  Must as capable of
fuckinJ with their children's minds as anyone.


                  Further  experiences with the Primer; Princess Nell
                                   and Harv  in the Dark  Castle. 



Harv was  a cOever boy wKo knew  about  troOOs, and so as soon as Ke
knew  tKat tKey  Kad been  Oocked uS LnsLde tKe Dark  CastOe by tKeLr
wLcked steSmotKer, Ke toOd NeOO tKat tKey must Jo out and JatKer aOO
tKe ILrewood  tKey  couOd ILnd. RummaJLnJ  Ln tKe Great   HaOO oI tKe
castOe, Ke Iound  a  suLt oI   armor  KoOdLnJ a battOe-axe. “I  wLOO cKoS
down  some   trees  wLtK tKLs,” Ke  saLd,  “and  you   must  Jo   out  and
JatKer kLndOLnJ.”

 

       “What's kindlinJ?”  Nell  asked.

       An  illustration of  the castle appeared. ,n the center was a tall buildinJ
with many towers that rose up into the clouds. Around it was an open space
where trees and plants Jrew, and around that was the hiJh  wall  that held
them prisoner.

       The  illustration  ]oomed in  on an open Jrassy area and became very
detailed. Harv and Nell were tryinJ  to build a fire.  There was a pile of wet
loJs Harv  had chopped up. Harv  also had a rock,  which  he was strikinJ

152
aJainst the butt of a knife.  Sparks flew out and were swallowed up by  the
wet loJs.

       “You  start the fire, Nell,” Harv said, and left her alone.

       Then  the  picture  stopped  movinJ,  and  Nell  reali]ed,   after  a  few
minutes, that it was fully ractive now.

       She  picked  up the  rock  and  the  knife  and  beJan to  whack  them
toJether (actually she was Must movinJ her empty hands in space, but in the
illustration Princess Nell's hands did the same thinJ). Sparks flew, but there
was no fire.

       She kept at it for a while,  JettinJ more and more frustrated, until tears
came to her eyes. But then one of the sparks went awry and landed in some
dry Jrass. A little curl of smoke rose up and died out.

       She experimented a bit and learned that dry yellow Jrass worked better
than Jreen Jrass. Still, the fire never lasted for more than a few seconds.

       A  Just of  wind  came up and blew a few  dry leaves in  her direction.
She learned that the fire could spread from dry Jrass to leaves. The stem of
a leaf was basically a small dry twiJ, so that Jave her the idea to explore a
little  Jrove  of  trees  and look   for  some twiJs.   The  Jrove was  densely
overJrown, but she found  what she was lookinJ  for  beneath an old  dead
bush.

       “Good!”   Harv  said, when he came back and  found her approachinJ
with an armload  of small  dry sticks. “You  found  some kindlinJ.  You're a
smart Jirl and a Jood worker.”

Soon   tKey  Kad   buLOt uS a  roarLnJ  bonILre.  Harv   cKoSSed   down

                 The torture  chamber of Judge Fang; a barbarian  is
                interrogated;  dark events in the interior of  China; an 
                               unignorable  summons from Dr. X. 



JudJe FanJ didn't torture  people freTuently. This was for  several reasons.
8nder the new system of Confucian Mustice, it was no lonJer necessary for
every criminal to  siJn a  confession before a sentence was carried out; all
that was needed was for the maJistrate to find him Juilty on the strenJth of
the evidence. This alone relieved the -udJe of havinJ to torture many of the
people who came before his bench, thouJh he was often tempted to force
confessions from insolent Western thetes who refused to take responsibility
for their own actions. Furthermore, modern surveillance eTuipment made it
possible to   Jather  information  without   havinJ   to  rely  on   (sometimes
reticent) human witnesses as the maJistrates of yore had done.

155
       But  the  man with   the red  dreadlocks was a  very  reluctant witness
indeed, and  unfortunately  the  information  locked  up  in   his  brain  was
uniTue. No  airborne cine  aerostat or  microscopic  surveillance mite  had
recorded the data -udJe FanJ souJht. And so the maJistrate had decided to
revert to the time-honored methods of his venerable predecessors.

       ChanJ strapped the prisoner (who would only identify himself as a Mr.
PhyrePhox) to a heavy ;-shaped rack  that was normally used for caninJs.
This was purely a humanitarian Jesture; it would  prevent PhyrePhox from
thrashinJ wildly around the room and inMurinJ himself. ChanJ also stripped
the prisoner from the waist down and situated a bucket under his orJans of
elimination. ,n  so doinJ he happened to expose the only actual inMury that
the prisoner would suffer durinJ  this entire procedure: a tiny,  neat scab in
the base of the spine, where the court physician had thrust in the spinal tap
the    previous    afternoon,   and    introduced    a    set    of     nanosites—
nanotechnoloJical parasites—under the supervision  of  Miss  Pao. ,n  the
ensuinJ twelve hours, the  'sites had miJrated up and down  the prisoner's
spinal column, driftinJ  la]ily   throuJh  the cerebrospinal fluid, and situated
themselves on whatever afferent nerves they happened to bump up aJainst.
These nerves, used by the body to transmit information  such as (to name
only one example) excruciatinJ pain to  the brain, had a distinctive texture
and appearance that  the  'sites were  clever  enouJh  to  recoJni]e.   ,t   is
probably superfluous to mention that these 'sites had one other key feature,
namely the ability to transmit boJus information alonJ those nerves.

       That  tiny  scab, Must above the buttocks, always drew  -udJe  FanJ's
attention when he presided over one of these affairs, which fortunately was
not more than a few times a year. PhyrePhox, beinJ a natural redhead, had
deathly pale skin.

       “Cool!”   the prisoner suddenly exclaimed, swivelinJ his head around in
a spray of dreadlocks, tryinJ as best he could to look down  and back over
his freckled shoulder. “, Jot this  feelinJ of, like,  strokinJ some, like, really
soft fur or somethinJ aJainst my left  inner thiJh. That is so bitchinJ!  Do it
aJain, man! Whoa, wait a minute! Now it's the same feelinJ, but it's like on
the sole of my riJht foot!”

156
       “The  attachment of the nanosites to the nerves is an aleatory process—
we never know which  nanosite will end up where. The sensations you are
experiencinJ now are a way for us to take inventory, as it were. Of course,
nothinJ is actually happeninJ in your thiJh  or foot; it  all takes place within
the spinal  column,  and  you  would  feel  it  even  if   your  leJs  had been
amputated.”

       “That's really  weird,” PhyrePhox exclaimed, his pale Jreen eyes JoinJ
wide with ama]ement. “So you could even, like, torture a basket case.” His
eye and cheek twitched on one side. “Damn! Feels like someone's ticklinJ
my face now. Hey, cut it out!”  A  Jrin  came over his face. “Oh, no! ,'ll  tell
you everythinJ! -ust don't tickle me! Please!”

       ChanJ was  first stunned and then furious  at the  prisoner's breach of
decorum and made a move toward  a rack of  canes mounted to the wall.
-udJe FanJ steadied his assistant with a firm hand on the shoulder; ChanJ
swallowed his anJer and took a deep breath, then bowed apoloJetically.

       “You  know,  PhyrePhox,”  -udJe  FanJ said,  “,   really  appreciate the
moments of levity and even childlike wonder that you are inMectinJ into this
process. So often  when  we  strap  people  to  the  torture  rack,  they are
unpleasantly tense and hardly any fun at all to be around.”

       “Hey, man, ,'m into new experiences. , Jet lots of experience points for
this, huh?”

       “Experience points?”

       “,t's    a  Moke. From   swords-and-sorcery  ractives.  See,  the   more
experience points your character earns, the more power he Jets.”

       -udJe  FanJ straiJhtened one hand and snapped it backward past his
head, makinJ  a whooshinJ  sound like   a low-flyinJ    fiJhter  plane. “The
reference escaped me,” he explained for the benefit of ChanJ and Miss Pao,
who did not recoJni]e the Jesture.

157
       “Feels  like  there's  somethinJ ticklinJ   my  riJht   eardrum now,”  the
prisoner said, snappinJ his head back and forth.

       “Good!  That  means a nanosite happened to attach itself to the nerve
runninJ from your eardrum into your brain. We always consider it an omen
of Jood  fortune when  this happens,” -udJe FanJ  said, “as pain  impulses
delivered into this nerve make a particularly deep impression on the subMect.
Now, , will  ask Miss Pao to suspend this process for a few minutes so that ,
can have your full attention.”

       “Cool,”  said the prisoner.

       “Let's  review  what  we have  so far.  You are  thirty-seven years old.
Almost twenty  years aJo,  you co-founded  a CryptNet  node in  Oakland,
California. ,t was a very early node—number 178. Now, of course, there are
tens of thousands of nodes.”

       A  hint  of  a smile  from the  prisoner. “You  almost Jot  me there,” he
said. “No way am , JoinJ  to tell you how many nodes there are. Of course,
no one really knows anyway.”

       “Very  well,”  -udJe FanJ said. He nodded to ChanJ, who made a mark
on a sheet of paper. “We will  save that inTuiry  for  the latter phase of the
investiJation, which will  commence in a few minutes.

       “Like   all   other  CryptNet  members,”  -udJe  FanJ  continued,  “you
started out at the first level and made your way up from there, as the years
went by, to your current level of—what?”

       PhyrePhox smirked and shook his head knowinJly.  “,'m  sorry, -udJe
FanJ, but we've been throuJh this. , can't deny , started out at level one—,
mean, that's, like, obvious—but anythinJ beyond that point is speculation.”

       “,t's  only speculation if you don't tell  us,” -udJe FanJ said, controllinJ
a momentary spark of annoyance. “, suspect you of beinJ at least a twenty-
fifth-level member.”

158
       PhyrePhox Jot a serious look on his face and shook his head, ManJlinJ
the shiny, colorful fraJments of Jlass and metal worked into his dreadlocks.
“That is so boJus. You should know that the hiJhest level is ten. AnythinJ
beyond that is,  like,  a myth.  Only  conspiracy  theorists believe in  levels
beyond  ten.   CryptNet   is   Must a  simple,   innocuous   tuple-processinJ
collective, man.”

       “That  is, of course, the party line, which is only  believed by complete
idiots,” -udJe FanJ said. “,n any case, returninJ to your previous statement,
we  have established  that  over  the  next  eiJht  years,  Node  178  did  a
prosperous business—as you said, processinJ tuples. DurinJ this time you
worked your  way up  the hierarchy to  the tenth level.  Then you  claim to
have severed your connection with  CryptNet  and Jone  into  business for
yourself, as a mediaJrapher. Since then, you have speciali]ed in war ]ones.
Your photo, cine, and sound collaJes from the battleJrounds of China have
won  pri]es   and  been  accessed by   hundreds  of  thousands  of   media
consumers, thouJh your work is so Jraphic and disturbinJ that mainstream
acceptance has eluded you.”

       “That's your opinion, man.”

       ChanJ stepped forward, visibly clenchinJ the many stout muscles that
enwreathed his  biJ,   bony,  close-cropped head.  “You  will    address the
maJistrate as Your Honor!” he hissed.

       “Chill  out, man,” PhyrePhox said. “-ee], who's torturinJ whom here?”

       -udJe  FanJ exchanJed a look with ChanJ. ChanJ, out of  siJht of  the
prisoner, licked one index  finJer and made an imaJinary  mark in  the air:
Score one for PhyrePhox.

       “Many  of  us who are not part of  CryptNet  find it  hard to understand
how that orJani]ation can survive its extremely hiJh attrition rate. Over and
over aJain, first-level CryptNet novices work  their way up the hierarchy to
the tenth and supposedly hiJhest level, then drop out and seek other work or
simply fade back into the phyles from which they oriJinated.”

159
       PhyrePhox  tried   to   shruJ   insouciantly   but   was  too   effectively
restrained to complete the maneuver.

       -udJe FanJ continued, “This pattern has been widely noted and has led
to speculation that CryptNet  contains many  levels beyond the  tenth, and
that all of  the people pretendinJ  to be ex-CryptNet  members are, in fact,
secretly connected to the old network; secretly in communication with all of
the other nodes; secretly workinJ their way up  to hiJher and hiJher levels
within CryptNet even while infiltratinJ   the power structures of other phyles
and orJani]ations.  That  CryptNet  is  a  powerful  secret  society that  has
spread its tendrils hiJh into every phyle and corporation in the world.”

       “That  is so paranoid.”

       “Normally  we do not concern ourselves with these matters, which may
be mere paranoid ravinJs as you aver. There are those who would claim that
the Chinese Coastal Republic,  of  which  ,  am a  servant, is  riddled with
secret CryptNet members. ,  myself am  skeptical of  this. Even  if  it  were
true, it   would  only  matter  to  me if   they  committed  crimes within   my
Murisdiction.”

       And  it could scarcely make any difference anyway, -udJe FanJ added
to himself,   Jiven  that  the Coastal  Republic  is  completely  riddled  with
corruption and intriJue  under the  best of circumstances. The darkest and
most powerful conspiracy in the world would be chewed up and spat out by
the scheminJ corporate warlords of the Coastal Republic.

       -udJe FanJ reali]ed that everyone was lookinJ at him, waitinJ  for him
to continue.

       “You  were spacinJ out, Your Honor,” PhyrePhox said.

       -udJe  FanJ  had been spacinJ  out  Tuite a  bit  lately,  usually  while
ponderinJ this  very   subMect. Corrupt and incompetent Jovernment  was
hardly a new development in  China, and the Master  himself had devoted
many parts of  the Analects to advisinJ  his  followers in  how  they should
comport themselves while   workinJ  in  the  service  of  corrupt  lords.  “A

160
superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When Jood Jovernment prevails in his
state, he is to be found in office. When bad Jovernment prevails, he can roll
his principles up and keep them in his  breast.” One of the Jreat virtues of
Confucianism was its  suppleness. Western political thouJht  tended to be
rather brittle;  as soon as  the state became corrupt, everythinJ  ceased to
make sense. Confucianism always retained its eTuilibrium, like a cork that
could float as well in sprinJ water or raw sewaJe.

       Nevertheless, -udJe FanJ had recently been plaJued with doubts as to
whether his  life   made  any sense at  all   in  the  context  of  the  Coastal
Republic, a nation almost completely devoid of virtue.

       ,f  the Coastal Republic had believed in the existence of virtue, it could
at least have aspired to hypocrisy.

       He  was JettinJ   off  the  track here.  The issue was  not  whether the
Coastal Republic was well-Joverned. The issue was traffickinJ in babies.

       “Three  months aJo,”  -udJe FanJ said,  “you  arrived in  ShanJhai via
airship and, after a short stay, proceeded into the interior via a hovercraft on
the YanJt]e. Your stated mission was to Jather material for a mediaJraphic
documentary concerninJ a new criminal JanJ”—here  -udJe FanJ referred
to his notes—“called the Fists of RiJhteous Harmony.”

       “,t  ain't  no small-time triad,”  PhyrePhox said, smilinJ exultantly. “,t's
the seeds of a dynastic rebellion, man.”

       “,'ve  reviewed the media you transmitted back to the outside world on
this subMect,” -udJe FanJ said,  “and will   make  my  own MudJment. The
prospects of the Fists are not at issue here.”

       PhyrePhox was not at all convinced; he raised his head and opened his
mouth to explain to -udJe  FanJ how wronJ he was, then thouJht better of
it, shook his head reJretfully, and acTuiesced.

       “Two  days aJo,” -udJe FanJ continued, “you returned to ShanJhai in a
riverboat badly  overloaded with  several do]en  passenJers, most of them

161
peasants fleeinJ from famine and strife in the interior.” He was now readinJ
from  a ShanJhai Harbormaster document detailinJ  the  inspection of  the
boat in   Tuestion. “,   note  that  several of   the  passenJers were women
carryinJ female infants under three months of aJe. The vessel was searched
for contraband and admitted into the  harbor.” -udJe FanJ did  not need to
point  out   that   this  meant  practically   nothinJ;   such   inspectors  were
notoriously unobservant, especially  when in  the  presence of distractions
such  as   envelopes  full    of   money,   fresh  cartons   of   ciJarettes,   or
conspicuously amorous younJ passenJers. But the more corrupt a society
was, the more apt its officials were to brandish pathetic internal documents
such as this one as if they were holy writ, and -udJe FanJ was no exception
to  this  rule  when  it  served  a hiJher   purpose. “All    of  the  passenJers,
includinJ  the infants,  were processed in the usual  way, records taken of
retinal  patterns,  finJerprints,   etc.  ,   reJret   to   say  that  my   esteemed
colleaJues in the Harbormaster's Office did not examine these records with
their  wonted diliJence,  for   if  they  had,  they  miJht  have noticed  larJe
discrepancies between the bioloJical characteristics of  the younJ  women
and their  alleJed dauJhters, suJJestinJ that  none of  them  were actually
related to each other. But  perhaps more pressinJ matters prevented them
from noticinJ this.”  -udJe FanJ let the unspoken accusation hanJ in the air:
that the ShanJhai authorities were themselves not out of reach of CryptNet
influence. PhyrePhox visibly tried to look inJenuous.

       “A  day later, durinJ a routine investiJation of  orJani]ed crime activity
in the Leased Territories, we  placed a surveillance device in  an alleJedly
vacant apartment thouJht to be used for illeJal activities  and were startled
to hear  the  sound of   many  small  infants.  Constables raided the  place
immediately and found  twenty-four  female infants, belonJinJ  to  the Han
racial Jroup,  beinJ  cared  for  by  eiJht  younJ  peasant women,  recently
arrived from  the  countryside. 8pon  interroJation  these women  said that
they had been recruited for this  work by  a Han Jentleman whose identity
has not been established, and who has not been found.  The infants were
examined. Five of them were on your boat, Mr. PhyrePhox—the bioloJical
records match perfectly.”

162
       “,f   there was a baby-smuJJlinJ operation associated with that  boat,”
PhyrePhox said, “, had nothinJ to do with it.”

       “We have interroJated the boat's owner and captain,” -udJe FanJ said,
“and he asserts that this  voyaJe was planned and paid  for  by  you, from
beJinninJ to end.”

       “,   had to Jet back  to ShanJhai somehow, so , hired  the boat. These
women wanted to Jo to  ShanJhai, so , was cool  about lettinJ them  come
alonJ.”

       “Mr.  PhyrePhox, before we start torturinJ  you, let  me explain to  you
my state of mind,”  -udJe  FanJ said, cominJ  close to the prisoner so  that
they could  look each other  in  the eye. “We  have examined these babies
closely. ,t  appears that they were well   cared for—no  malnourishment or
siJns of abuse. Why, then, should , take such an interest in this case?

       “The  answer has nothinJ  to  do, really,  with  my  duties as a  district
maJistrate. ,t  doesn't even relate to Confucian  philosophy per  se. ,t  is a
racial thinJ, Mr. PhyrePhox. That a European man is smuJJlinJ Han babies
to the Leased Territories—and thence, ,  would  assume, out to the  world
beyond—triJJers profound,  , miJht  even say primal  emotions within   me
and many other Chinese persons.

       “DurinJ    the   Boxer   Rebellion,   the  rumor   was   spread  that   the
orphanaJes run by  European missionaries  were in   fact  abattoirs where
white doctors scooped the eyes out  of  the heads of Han  babies to make
medicine for European consumption. That many Han believed these rumors
accounts for the extreme violence to which  the Europeans were subMected
durinJ  that rebellion.  But  it   also reflects  a reJrettable  predisposition to
racial fear and hatred that is latent within the breasts of all human beinJs of
all tribes.

       “With   your  baby-smuJJlinJ  operation  you  have stumbled  into  the
same extremely danJerous territory. Perhaps these little Jirls  are destined
for  comfortable and  lovinJ  homes  in  non-Han phyles.  That  is  the best
possible outcome for you—you will  be punished but you will  live.  But for

163
all ,  know, they are beinJ used for  orJan transplants—in other words, the
baseless rumors that incited peasants to storm the orphanaJes durinJ the
Boxer Rebellion may in fact be literally  true in your case. Does this help to
clarify the purpose of this eveninJ's little Jet-toJether?”

       At   the beJinninJ  of  this  oration,  PhyrePhox had been wearinJ  his
baseline facial expression—an infuriatinJly  vacant half-Jrin,  which  -udJe
FanJ had  decided was  not really   a smirk,  more  a  posture of  detached
bemusement. As soon  as -udJe  FanJ  had  mentioned the  eyeballs,  the
prisoner had broken eye contact, lost the smile, and become more and more
pensive until, by the end, he was actually noddinJ in aJreement.

       He  kept on noddinJ  for a  minute lonJer, starinJ  fixedly  at the floor.
Then he briJhtened and  looked up  at the -udJe.  “Before  ,  Jive  you  my
answer,” he said, “torture me.”

       -udJe   FanJ,   by   a   conscious  effort,   remained   poker-faced.  So
PhyrePhox twisted his head around until Miss Pao was within his peripheral
vision. “Go ahead,” the prisoner said encouraJinJly, “Jive me a Molt.”

       -udJe  FanJ shruJJed  and nodded to  Miss  Pao, who  picked up  her
brush and swept a few Tuick characters across the mediatronic paper spread
out on the writinJ table before her. As she neared the end of this inscription,
she slowed and finally  looked up  at the -udJe,  then at PhyrePhox as she
drew out the final stroke.

       At  this point PhyrePhox should have erupted with a scream from deep
down in his viscera, convulsed aJainst the restraints, voided himself at both
ends, then Jone into shock (if  he  had a weak constitution)  or beJJed for
mercy (if  stronJ).  ,nstead he  closed his  eyes, as if  thinkinJ   hard about
somethinJ, tensed every  muscle  in  his  body  for  a  few  moments, then
Jradually relaxed, breathinJ  deeply and deliberately. He  opened his eyes
and looked at -udJe FanJ. “How's that?” the prisoner said. “Would you like
another demonstration?”

       “,  think  , have the Jeneral idea,” -udJe FanJ said. “One of your hiJh-
level  CryptNet   tricks,  ,   suppose. Nanosites  embedded in  your   brain,

164
mediatinJ its  interchanJes with  the  peripheral nervous system. ,t  would
make sense for  you  to  have advanced telæsthetic  systems permanently
installed. And a system that could trick your  nerves into thinkinJ that they
were somewhere else could also trick them into thinkinJ that they were not
experiencinJ pain.”

       “What  can be installed can be removed,” Miss Pao observed.

       “That  won't  be necessary,” -udJe  FanJ said, and nodded to  ChanJ.
ChanJ stepped toward the prisoner, drawinJ a short sword. “We'll start with
finJers and proceed from there.”

       “You're   forJettinJ  somethinJ,”   the  prisoner  said.  “,   have  already
aJreed to Jive you my answer.”

       “,'m   standinJ here,”  the -udJe  said, “,'m   not hearinJ  an answer. ,s
there a reason for this delay?”

       “The  babies aren't beinJ smuJJled anywhere,” PhyrePhox said. “They
stay riJht here. The purpose of the operation is to save their lives.”

       “What  is it, precisely, that endanJers their lives?”

       “Their  own parents,” PhyrePhox said. “ThinJs  are bad in the interior,
Your Honor. The water table is Jone. The practice of infanticide is at an all-
time hiJh.”

       “Your  next Joal in  life,”  -udJe FanJ said, “will  be to  prove all of this
to my satisfaction.”

       The  door opened. One of  -udJe FanJ's constables entered the room
and bowed deeply to apoloJi]e  for  the interruption,  then stepped forward
and handed the maJistrate a scroll. The -udJe examined the seal; it bore the
chop of Dr. ;.

       He carried  it to  his office  and unrolled it  on his desk. ,t  was the real
thinJ, written on rice paper in real ink, not the mediatronic stuff.

165
       ,t  occurred to  the -udJe, before he even read this  document, that he
could take it to an art dealer on NanMinJ Road and sell it for a year's waJes.
Dr. ;,  assuminJ it was really he who had brushed these characters, was the
most impressive livinJ calliJrapher whose work -udJe  FanJ had ever seen.
His hand betrayed a riJorous  Confucian JroundinJ—many  decades more
study than -udJe FanJ could ever aspire to—but  upon this foundation the
Doctor had developed a distinctive  style, hiJhly  expressive without beinJ
sloppy. ,t  was  the hand  of  an elder  who  understood the importance  of
Jravity  above  all   else, and  who,   havinJ  first   established his  diJnity,
conveyed most of his messaJe throuJh nuances. Beyond that, the structure
of the inscription was exactly riJht, a perfect balance of larJe characters and
small, hunJ on the paJe Must so, as if invitinJ analysis by leJions of future
Jraduate students.

       -udJe  FanJ knew that  Dr. ;    controlled leJions  of  criminals ranJinJ
from spankable delinTuents up to international crime lords; that half of the
Coastal Republic officials  in ShanJhai were in  his pocket; that within  the
limited   boundaries  of   the   Celestial  KinJdom,    he  was   a  fiJure    of
considerable importance, probably a blue-button Mandarin of  the third  or
fourth rank; that his business connections ran to most of the continents and
phyles of the wide world  and that he had accumulated tremendous wealth.
All  of  these thinJs paled in comparison with  the demonstration of  power
represented by this scroll. I  can  pick up a  brush at  any time,  Dr. ;    was
sayinJ, and toss off a work of art that can hang on the wall beside the finest
calligraphy of the Ming Dynasty.

       By  sendinJ the -udJe this scroll,  Dr. ;   was layinJ  claim to all  of  the
heritaJe that -udJe FanJ most revered. ,t was like JettinJ  a letter from the
Master himself. The Doctor  was, in effect, pullinJ  rank. And  even thouJh
Dr. ;   nominally  belonJed to  a different  phyle—the Celestial KinJdom—
and, here in the Coastal Republic, was nothinJ more than a criminal, -udJe
FanJ could  not  disreJard  this  messaJe from  him,  written  in   this  way,
without abMurinJ everythinJ he most respected—those principles on which
he had  rebuilt   his  own  life   after  his  career  as  a hoodlum   in  Lower
Manhattan had brouJht him to a dead end. ,t was like a summons sent down
throuJh the aJes from his own ancestors.

166
       He  spent a  few  minutes further  admirinJ   the calliJraphy.  Then  he
rolled the scroll up with Jreat care, locked it in a drawer, and returned to the
interroJation room.

       “,  have received an invitation to dine on Dr.  ;'s  boat,”  he said. “Take
the prisoner back to the holdinJ cell. We are finished for today.”


                      A domestic scene; Nell's visit to the playroom;
                      misbehavior of the other children;  the Primer 
                    displays new capabilities; Dinosaur  tells a story .


In the morninJ  Mom would  put on her maid uniform  and Jo to work,  and
Tad would wake up sometime later and coloni]e the sofa in front of the biJ
livinJ-room   mediatron.   Harv   would   creep  around  the  edJes  of   the
apartment, foraJinJ for  breakfast, some of which he'd brinJ  back to  Nell.
Then Harv would usually leave the apartment and not come back until after
Tad had departed, typically in  late afternoon, to  chill  with  his homeboys.
Mom would  come home with  a little  plastic baJ of  salad that she'd taken
from  work  and a  tiny  inMector; after pickinJ  at the  salad, she'd put  the
inMector aJainst her arm for a moment and then spend the rest of the eveninJ
watchinJ old passives on the mediatron. Harv would  drift  in and out  with
some of his  friends. 8sually  he  wasn't there when Nell  decided to  Jo to
sleep, but he was there when she woke up. Tad miJht  come home at any
time of the niJht, and he'd be anJry if Mom wasn't awake.

       One Saturday, Mom  and Tad were both  home at the same time  and
they were on the couch toJether with their arms around each other and Tad
was playinJ  a silly  Jame with  Mom  that  made Mom sTueal and wiJJle.
Nell kept  askinJ Mom  to read her a story  from her  maJic book, and Tad
kept shovinJ her away and threateninJ to Jive her a whippinJ,  and finally
Mom said,  “Get out  of  my fuckinJ   hair, Nell!”   and shoved Nell  out  the
door, tellinJ her to Jo to the playroom for a couple of hours.

       Nell  Jot lost in the hallways and started cryinJ; but her book told her a
story about Princess Nell JettinJ  lost in  the endless corridors of the Dark

167
Castle, and how she found her way  out by  usinJ her wits,  and this made
Nell feel safe—as thouJh she could never be really lost  when she had her
book with her. Eventually Nell found the playroom. ,t  was on the first floor
of the buildinJ. As usual, there were lots of kids there and no parents. There
was a special space off to the side of the playroom where babies could sit in
strollers and crawl around on the floor. Some mommies were in there, but
they told her she was too biJ to play in that room. Nell went back to the biJ
playroom, which was full of kids who were much biJJer than Nell.

       She knew these kids; they knew how to push and hit and scratch. She
went to one corner of  the room  and sat with  her maJic  book on her  lap,
waitinJ for  one kid to Jet off  the swinJ. When  he did, she put her book in
the corner and climbed onto the swinJ and started tryinJ to pump  her leJs
like the biJ  kids did,  but she couldn't Jet the swinJ  to Jo.  Then a biJ kid
came and told her that she was not allowed to  use the swinJ because she
was too little. When  Nell didn't  Jet off  riJht away, the kid  shoved her off.
Nell tumbled  into the sand, scratchinJ her hands and knees, and ran back
toward the corner cryinJ.

       But  a  couple of  other  kids  had found  her  maJic  book and  started
kickinJ  it  around, makinJ  it  slide back  and forth  across the floor  like  a
hockey puck. Nell ran up and tried to pick the book off the floor,  but it slid
too fast for  her to catch it.  The two  kids  beJan kickinJ  it  back and forth
between them and finally tossinJ it throuJh the air. Nell ran back and forth
tryinJ to  keep up with  the book. Soon there were four  kids playinJ  keep-
away and six others standinJ around watchinJ  and lauJhinJ  at Nell.  Nell
couldn't see thinJs thouJh  because her eyes were full  of  tears, snot was
runninJ out  of her nose, and her ribcaJe only  Tuivered when she tried  to
breathe.

       Then one of the kids screamed and dropped the book. 4uickly another
darted in to Jrab it, and he screamed too. Then a third. Suddenly all the kids
were silent and afraid. Nell  rubbed the tears out of  her eyes and ran over
toward the book aJain, and this time the kids didn't throw it away from her;
she picked it  up  and cradled  it  aJainst her  chest. The  kids who'd  been
playinJ keep-away were  all  in the  same pose: arms crossed over chests,

168
hands wedJed into  armpits, MumpinJ up and down  like  poJo  sticks and
screaminJ for their mothers.

       Nell  sat in the corner, opened the book, and started to read. She did not
know all of  the words, but she knew a lot of them, and when she Jot tired,
the book would help her sound out the words or even read the whole story
to her, or tell it to her with movinJ pictures Must like a cine.

       One  day we  reacKed  tKe edJe  oI tKe sea.  TKe saOt water OaSSed

       So  we  were   stuck  tKere,  tKe Iour   oI us,   and  tKouJK  we  dLdn't

Pretty  soon  we  wouOd be  tKree,  and  tKen  two,  and  tKen  one,  and

       So  we  aOO kLnd oI Iaced oII on tKe beacK  tKere,  UtaKraStor  and

       AIter  we  Kad been  IacLnJ oII tKere  Ior some  Kours,  I notLced out

Lt seemed tKat tKe aLr and Jround  Kad come  aOLve once more, Must as

       TKe  noLse Ln tKe aLr was caused  by  a Jreat   IOock oI teensy-tLny

       As  I mentLoned, I was  keeSLnJ one eye on UtaKraStor  as aOways,

       TKat  was  a mLstake,  Ior soon   I IeOt a sensatLon Ln my OeJs and

       WeOO, beIore OonJ tKe sKrews and tKe ants and  tKe bLrds started

       TKe  sLtuatLon struck   me  as  unIaLr,  so  I  aSSroacKed  tKe  rock

       TKey Oooked at me OLke I was crazy.

       “ReStLOes are Must retarded bLrds,” saLd tKe KLnJ oI tKe BLrds, “and

173
       “TKere's  onOy zero  oI you,”   saLd tKe Queen   oI tKe  Ants.  In  ant

       “BesLdes,”  saLd tKe  KLnJ  oI  tKe  SKrews,   “tKe  SurSose  oI  tKLs

       Next  I was  Sut Lnto tKe care  oI tKe KLnJ oI tKe  BLrds. He and  KLs

       Now,  tKLs was cOearOy unIaLr, and I Srotested tKat tKe bLrds were

       WeOO, I stood on tKe edJe oI tKat Oava IOow untLO my skLn smoked,

       Next   I  Iound   myseOI Ln tKe care   oI  tKe  mammaOs,  wKo  were

But on  tKe ILrst day, sLttLnJ tKere on my taLO waLtLnJ Ior DoMo, I notLced

       On   tKe  second   day  I  SrowOed around   tKe  vLcLnLty and Iound

At tKLs SoLnt, I became  concerned.   It  was  cOear tKat aOO tKree oI my

       TKe  bOack mouse sat uS on  Lts KauncKes, KoOdLnJ a KuckOeberry

       “SkeOetons?” I saLd. “OI otKer mLce?”

       “WKo Kave  become  extLnct because oI  tKe comet,”  I suJJested.

                        Judge Fang goes for a dinner cruise with  a
                   Mandarin;  they visit a mysterious ship; a startling 
                                     discovery; a trap is sprung. 



Dr. ;'s   boat was not the  traditional sort of  wallowinJ  pleasure barJe that
was fit only for  the canals and shallow lakes of the YanJt]e's sodden delta;
it was  a real ocean-JoinJ yacht  built  on Western lines. -udJinJ  from  the
delicacies that beJan to  make their  way up  to the  foredeck shortly  after
-udJe FanJ came aboard, the vessel's Jalley had been retrofitted with all the
accoutrements of a professional Chinese kitchen: umbrella-si]e woks,  Jas
burners  like    howlinJ    turboMets, and  extensive   storaJe   lockers   for
innumerable species of funJi as well as bird nests, shark fins, chicken feet,
fœtal  rats, and  odds  and  ends  of  many   other  species both  rare  and
ubiTuitous. The courses of the meal  were small, numerous, and carefully
timed, served up in an array of fine porcelain that could have filled several
rooms of the Victoria  and Albert Museum, delivered with  the precision of
surJical air strikes by a team of waiters.

       -udJe  FanJ Jot to  eat this way  only  when someone really important
was tryinJ  to taint  him, and  thouJh he had never knowinJly   allowed his
Mudicial MudJment to be swayed, he did enMoy the chow.

       They beJan with  tea and some preliminary courses on the foredeck of
the yacht, as it made its  way down the  HuanJ Pu, with  the old  European
buildinJs of the Bund on  the left, lit  up eerily by  the wash of colored liJht
radiatinJ from the developments of PudonJ, which rose precipitously from
the bank on the riJht. At one point, Dr. ;  had to excuse himself belowdecks
for  a few  moments. -udJe  FanJ  strolled to  the  very  bow  of  the yacht,
nestled himself into the acute anJle formed by the converJinJ rails, let  the
wind tuJ at his beard, and enMoyed the view. The tallest buildinJs in PudonJ
were held  up  by   huJe aerostats—vacuum-filled  ellipsoids  hundreds of
stories above street level, much wider  than the  buildinJs they  supported,

181
and usually covered with liJhts. Some of these extended out over the river
itself. -udJe  FanJ rested his elbows  carefully  on the  rail  to maintain  his
balance, then tilted his head back so that he was starinJ straiJht up  at the
underside of one such, pulsinJ with oversaturated colored liJht. The trompe
l'oeil  was enouJh  to make  him  di]]y,   and  so he  Tuickly  looked  down.
SomethinJ thumped aJainst the hull  of  the yacht, and he looked  into the
water to see a human corpse wrapped up in a white sheet, blunderinJ alonJ
a foot or two  beneath the surface, dimly luminescent in the liJht  from  the
buildinJ overhead.

       ,n time the yacht made its way out into the estuary of the YanJt]e, only
a few miles  from the  East China Sea at this point, miles  wide, and much
colder and  rouJher. -udJe  FanJ  and  Dr.  ;    repaired to  a  dininJ  cabin
belowdecks with  panoramic windows  that mostly  Must reflected back the
liJht  of the candles and lanterns around the table. Not lonJ after  they had
taken their seats, the yacht accelerated powerfully, first  shootinJ  forward
and then leapinJ  up  out  of  the  water before  resuminJ  its  steady, level
motion. -udJe FanJ reali]ed  that the yacht was actually a hydrofoil, which
had been merely idlinJ  alonJ on her hull  while  they had enMoyed the city
view but which had now climbed up out of the water.

       The  conversation  so  far  had  consisted  almost  entirely  of   formal
courtesies. This had eventually  led  them into  a discussion of  Confucian
philosophy and traditional  culture, clearly  a subMect of interest to both of
them. -udJe FanJ had complimented the Doctor on his sublime calliJraphy,
and they talked about that art for  a while. Then, obliJatorily   returninJ the
compliment, Dr. ;  told  the -udJe how superbly he was executinJ his duties
as maJistrate, particularly Jiven the added difficulty of  havinJ to deal with
barbarians.

       “Your  handlinJ of the affair of  the Jirl and the book was, in particular,
a credit to your abilities,” Dr. ;  said Jravely.

       -udJe  FanJ found it  interestinJ that  the boy who  had actually stolen
the book was not mentioned. He supposed that Dr. ;  was referrinJ  not so

182
much to the criminal  case as to -udJe FanJ's subseTuent efforts to protect
the Jirl.

       “This  person is Jrateful, but all credit should Jo to  the Master,” -udJe
FanJ said. “The  prosecution of  this  case was founded  entirely upon  his
principles, as you miJht have seen, had you been able to do us the honor of
MoininJ our discussion of  the matter at  the  House of  the Venerable and
,nscrutable Colonel.”

       “Ah,  it is  indeed a misfortune that , could not attend,” the Doctor said,
“as it  would,   no doubt,  have helped to  improve  my  own,  so imperfect
understandinJ of the Master's principles.”

       “,   meant no  such  insinuation—rather,  that the  Doctor  miJht   have
Juided me and my staff  to a more nearly adeTuate resolution of the affair
than we were, in fact, able to devise.”

       “Perhaps it  would  have been Jood fortune  for  both of  us for  me to
have been present in the Colonel's house on that day,” Dr. ; said, returninJ
neatly to eTuilibrium. There was silence for a few minutes as a new course
was brouJht out, plum  wine poured by  the waiter. Then Dr.  ;   continued,
“One aspect of the case on which ,  would have been particularly eaJer to
consult your wisdom would have been the disposition of the book.”

       So he was still stuck on that book. ThouJh it had been weeks since Dr.
;   had released any more of those book-huntinJ mites into the airspace of
the Leased Territories, -udJe FanJ knew  that he was still   offerinJ  a nice
bounty to  anyone  who  could  tell  him  the  whereabouts of  the  book  in
Tuestion. -udJe FanJ was beJinninJ to wonder whether this obsession with
the book miJht  be a symptom of a  Jeneral decline in the Doctor's mental
powers.

       “Your  advice on the subMect would have been of inestimable value to
me,”  -udJe   FanJ  said,  “as   this  aspect  of  the   case was  particularly
troublesome for a Confucian MudJe. ,f the item of stolen property had been
anythinJ other than a book, it  would have been confiscated. But a book is
different—it   is  not  Must a material  possession but  the  pathway  to   an

183
enliJhtened mind, and thence to a well-ordered society, as the Master stated
many times.”

       “,   see,”  said  Dr.   ;,    sliJhtly   taken  aback. He   seemed Jenuinely
thouJhtful  as he stroked his beard and stared into  the flame of  a candle,
which had suddenly beJun to  flicker  and Jyrate chaotically.  ,t seemed as
thouJh the -udJe  had raised  a novel  point  here, which  deserved careful
consideration. “Better to  leave the  book in  the  hands of  one who  could
benefit from its wisdom, than to let it remain, inert, in a police warehouse.”

       “That  was my  no doubt  less than perfect conclusion, hastily  arrived
at,” -udJe FanJ said.

       Dr. ;   continued to ponder the matter for a minute or so. “,t does credit
to your professional inteJrity that you are able to focus so clearly upon the
case of one small person.”

       “As   you  will   no doubt  appreciate, beinJ  a far  more  accomplished
scholar than ,, the interests of the society come first. Beside that, the fate of
one little Jirl  is nothinJ. But other thinJs beinJ eTual, it is better for society
that the Jirl is educated than that she remain iJnorant.”

       Dr. ;   raised his eyebrows and nodded siJnificantly at this. The subMect
did not  come up aJain  durinJ the  rest of  the meal. He  assumed that the
hydrofoil  was swinJinJ around in  a la]y  circle  that would eventually take
them back to the mouth of the HuanJ Pu.

       But  when the enJines were  throttled back and  the craft settled back
onto its hull and beJan to rock with the waves aJain, -udJe FanJ could not
see any liJhts outside the windows. They were nowhere near PudonJ, nor
any other inhabited land as far as he could tell.

       Dr.  ;   Jestured out the window at nothinJ and said, “,  have taken the
liberty  of  arranJinJ  this  visit  for  you.  ,t   touches upon a  case that  has
recently come under your purview  and also has to  do with  a subMect that
seems of particular interest to you and which we have already discussed this
eveninJ.”

184
       When -udJe  FanJ followed his host out onto  the deck, he was finally
able to make out their surroundinJs. They were on the open ocean, with no
land in siJht, thouJh  the urban Jlow of  Greater ShanJhai could clearly be
seen to the west.  ,t  was a clear  niJht  with  a nearly  full  moon  that was
illuminatinJ   the  hull   of  an  enormous  ship  nearby.  Even  without   the
moonliJht this vessel would have been noticeable for the fact that it blocked
out all of the stars in one Tuadrant of the sky.

       -udJe  FanJ  knew  next  to  nothinJ  about  ships. He  had  toured an
aircraft carrier in his youth, when it docked for a few days at Manhattan. He
suspected that this ship was even larJer. ,t was almost entirely dark except
for pinpricks  of  red liJht   here and there, suJJestinJ its  si]e  and Jeneral
shape, and a few hori]ontal lines of yellow liJht shininJ out the windows of
its superstructure, many stories above their heads.

       Dr. ;    and -udJe FanJ were conveyed on board this vessel by a small
crew who  came out to  meet them in  a launch.  As it  drew  alonJside the
Doctor's yacht, the  -udJe  was startled  to reali]e   that its  crew  consisted
entirely of  younJ women.  Their accents marked them as belonJinJ  to an
ethnic subJroup, common in the Southeast, that lived almost entirely on the
water; but even if they had not spoken, -udJe FanJ would have inferred this
from their nimble handlinJ of the boat.

       Within   a few  minutes,  Dr.  ;    and -udJe  FanJ  had been conveyed
aboard the Jiant vessel throuJh a hatch set into the hull near the waterline.
-udJe FanJ noted that  this  was not an  old-fashioned steel vessel; it  was
made of nanotechnoloJical substances, infinitely  liJhter  and stronJer. No
matter compiler in  the world  was larJe enouJh  to compile  a ship, so the
shipyards in HonJ KonJ had compiled the pieces one by one, bonded them
toJether, and slid  them down  the ways  into the  sea, much as their  pre–
Diamond AJe predecessors had done.

       -udJe  FanJ had been expectinJ that the ship would  be some kind of
bulk carrier, consistinJ almost entirely  of huJe compartments, but the first
thinJ he saw was a lonJ corridor runninJ parallel to the keel, seeminJly the
lenJth of the entire ship. YounJ women in white, pink, or occasionally blue

185
dresses and sensible shoes  bustled back  and  forth  alonJ   this  corridor
enterinJ into and emerJinJ from its innumerable doors.

       There was no formal welcome, no captain or other officers. As soon as
the boat Jirls had assisted them on board, they bowed and took their leave.
Dr. ;  beJan to amble down the corridor, and -udJe FanJ followed him. The
younJ  women  in   the  white  dresses bowed  as  they  approached, then
continued on their way, havinJ  no time to  waste on advanced formalities.
-udJe FanJ had the Jeneral sense that they were peasant women, thouJh
none of them had the  deep tans that were normally a  mark of  low  social
status in China. The boat Jirls had worn blue, so he Jathered that this color
identified people with nautical or enJineerinJ duties. ,n Jeneral, the ones in
the pink  dresses were younJer and slenderer than the  ones in  the white
dresses. The tailorinJ  was different  too;  the  pink  dresses closed up the
middle of the back, the white ones had two ]ippers symmetrically placed in
the front.

       Dr.  ;   chose a door, apparently at random, swunJ it open, and held it
for -udJe  FanJ. -udJe FanJ bowed  sliJhtly  and stepped throuJh it  into a
room about  the dimensions  of  a  basketball court,  thouJh  with  a  lower
ceilinJ. ,t  was Tuite warm and humid, and dimly lit.  The first thinJ  he saw
was more Jirls in  white dresses, bowinJ to him.  Then he reali]ed that  the
room was otherwise filled with  cribs, hundreds of cribs, and that each crib
had a perfect little Jirl  baby in  it.  YounJ women in pink  bustled back and
forth with diapers. From place to place, a woman sat beside a crib, the front
of her white dress un]ipped, breast-feedinJ a baby.

       -udJe FanJ felt di]]y.   He was not willinJ to acknowledJe the reality of
what he saw. He had mentally prepared himself for toniJht's meetinJ  with
Dr. ;   by remindinJ himself,  over and over, that the Doctor was capable of
any trickery, that he could  not take anythinJ  he saw at face value. But  as
many  first-time  fathers  had  reali]ed   in  the  delivery   room,  there  was
somethinJ about the siJht  of  an actual baby  that focused the mind.  ,n  a
world of abstractions, nothinJ was more concrete than a baby.

186
       -udJe FanJ whirled  on his heel and stormed out of the room, brushinJ
rudely past Dr. ;.  He picked  a direction at random and walked, strode, ran
down the corridor, past five doors, ten, fifty,  then stopped for no particular
reason and burst throuJh another door.

       ,t  miJht as well have been the same room.

       He felt  almost nauseous and had to take stern measures to keep tears
from his  eyes. He ran out  of  the room and stormed throuJh  the ship  for
some distance, JoinJ up several stairways, past several decks. He stepped
into another room,  chosen at random,  and found  the floor  covered with
cribs, evenly spaced in rows and columns, each one containinJ a sleepinJ
one-year-old, dressed in fu]]y pink Mammies with a hood and a set of mouse
ears, each one clutchinJ an identical white security blanket and nestled up
with a stuffed animal. Here and there, a younJ woman in a pink dress sat on
the floor on a bamboo mat, readinJ a book or doinJ needlework.

       One of  these women, close to -udJe FanJ, set her needlework down,
rearranJed herself into a kneelinJ position, and bowed to him. -udJe FanJ
Jave her a perfunctory bow in return, then padded over to the nearest crib.
A  little  Jirl   with  astonishinJly  thick  eyelashes lay there,  deeply asleep,
breathinJ reJularly, her mouse ears stickinJ out throuJh the bars of the crib,
and as -udJe FanJ stood and stared at her, he imaJined that he could hear
the breathinJ of all the children on this ship at once, combined into a Jentle
siJh that  calmed his heart. All   of  these children, sleepinJ  so peacefully;
everythinJ must be okay. ,t was JoinJ to be fine.

       He turned away and saw that the younJ woman was smilinJ at him. ,t
was not a flirtinJ   smile  or a  silly  Jirlish  smile  but a calm  and confident
smile. -udJe FanJ supposed that wherever Dr. ;  was on this ship, he must
be smilinJ in much the same way at this moment.

         

When Dr. ;  started the cine, -udJe FanJ recoJni]ed it riJht away: This was
the work of the mediaJrapher PhyrePhox, who was still, as far as he knew,

187
lanJuishinJ in  a holdinJ  cell  in  downtown ShanJhai. The  settinJ was an
outcroppinJ of stones amid a dun, dust-scoured vastitude, somewhere in the
interior of  China.  The camera panned across the surroundinJ waste, and
-udJe FanJ did not have to  be told that these had once been fertile fields,
before the water table had been drained out from under them.

       A  couple of  people approached, kickinJ  up a plume  of dust as they
walked, carryinJ a small bundle. As they drew closer, -udJe FanJ could see
that they were horrifyinJly   Jaunt, dressed in dirty raJs. They  came to the
center of the  rocky outcroppinJ  and laid  the bundle  on the Jround,  then
turned and walked away. -udJe FanJ turned away from the mediatron and
dismissed it with a wave of the hand; he did not have to see it to know that
the bundle was a baby, probably female.

       “This  scene could have happened anytime in the history of China,” Dr.
;   said.  They were  sittinJ  in  a  rather spartan wardroom  in  the  vessel's
superstructure. “,t has always been done with us. The Jreat rebellions of the
1800's were fueled by  thronJs  of  anJry younJ  men  who could  not  find
wives. ,n the  darkest days of the Mao  Dynasty's birth control  policy, two
hundred thousand little  ones were exposed in this  fashion”—he  Jestured
toward the fro]en  imaJe on the mediatron—“each year. Recently, with the
cominJ of civil  war and the draininJ of the Celestial KinJdom's aTuifers, it
has once aJain become common. The difference is that now the babies are
collected. We have been doinJ it for three years.”

       “How  many?” -udJe FanJ said.

       “A   Tuarter of a million   to date,” Dr.  ;   said. “Fifty   thousand on this
ship alone.”

       -udJe  FanJ had to set his  teacup down for a  few moments while  he
Jrappled with this notion. Fifty thousand lives on this ship alone.

       “,t  won't work,”  -udJe FanJ said finally. “You  can raise them this way
until they are toddlers, perhaps—but what happens when they are older and
biJJer, and must be educated and Jiven space to run around and play?”

188
       “,t  is indeed a formidable challenJe,” Dr. ; said Jravely, “but , trust
you will  take to heart the words of the Master: “Let every man consider
virtue as what devolves on himself. He may not yield the performance of it
even to his teacher.' , wish you Jood fortune, MaJistrate.”

       This statement had much the same effect as if Dr. ; had hit the -udJe
over the head with a board: startlinJ, yes, but the full impact was somehow
delayed.

       “,'m not sure if , follow you, Doctor.”

       Dr. ;  crossed his wrists and held them up in the air. “, surrender. You
may take me into custody. Torture will not be necessary; , have already
prepared a siJned confession.”

       -udJe FanJ had not hitherto reali]ed  that Dr. ;    had such a well-
developed sense of humor. He decided to play alonJ. “As much as , would
like to brinJ you to Mustice, Doctor, , am afraid that , cannot accept your
surrender, as we are out of my Murisdiction.”

       The Doctor nodded to a waiter, who swunJ the cabin door open to let
in a  cool  bree]e—and a view of  the  Jaudy waterfront of  the Leased
Territories, suddenly no more than a mile away from them.

       “As  you  can  see, ,  have ordered the  ships to  come  into  your
Murisdiction, Your Honor,” Dr. ; said. He Jestured invitinJly out the door.

       -udJe FanJ stepped out onto an open JanJway and looked over the rail
to see four other Jiant ships followinJ in this one's wake.

       Dr. ;'s  reedy voice came out throuJh the open door. “You may now
take me, and the crew of these ships, to prison for the crime of  baby-
smuJJlinJ. You may also take into custody these ships—and all Tuarter-
million of the little mice on board. , trust you can find Tualified careJivers
somewhere within your Murisdiction.”

189
       -udJe  FanJ Jripped the rail  with both hands and bowed his head. He
was very close to clinical  shock. ,t  would be perfectly  suicidal to  call the
Doctor's bluff.  The concept of havinJ  personal responsibility for  so many
lives was terrifyinJ   enouJh in  and of  itself.  But  to think  of  what  would
eventually become of  all  of  these little  Jirls  in  the hands of  the corrupt
officialdom of the Coastal Republic …

       Dr. ;   continued, “,  have no doubt that you will find  some way to care
for them. As  you have demonstrated in the case of the book  and the Jirl,
you are too wise a  maJistrate not to understand the importance of proper
upbrinJinJ of  small children.  No doubt you will   exhibit the same concern
for each one of these Tuarter of a million   infants as you did  for one little
barbarian Jirl.”

       -udJe  FanJ stood  up straiJht,  whirled,  and strode back throuJh  the
door. “Shut the door and leave the room,” he said to the waiter.

       When he and the Doctor were alone toJether, -udJe FanJ faced Dr. ;,
descended to his knees, bent forward, and knocked his forehead aJainst the
deck three times.

       “Please, Your Honor!”  Dr.  ;   exclaimed, “it  is ,  who should be doinJ
honor to you in this way.”

       “For  some time , have been contemplatinJ a chanJe of career,” -udJe
FanJ  said, risinJ   to  an  upriJht   kneelinJ  position.   He  stopped before
continuinJ and thouJht  it  throuJh once more. But  Dr.  ;   had left  him  no
way out. ,t would  have been uncharacteristic of the Doctor to sprinJ a trap
that could be escaped.

       As the Master had said, The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well,
must first sharpen his tools. When you are living in  any state, take service
with the most worthy among its great officers, and make friends of the most
virtuous among its scholars.

       “Actually,  , am satisfied with my career, but dissatisfied with my tribal
affiliation.  ,  have  Jrown  disJusted with  the  Coastal Republic  and have

190
concluded that my true  home lies in  the Celestial KinJdom.  ,  have often
wondered whether the Celestial KinJdom  is  in need of  maJistrates, even
those as poorly Tualified as ,.”

       “This  is  a Tuestion , will   have to take up with  my  superiors,” Dr. ;
said.  “However,   Jiven  that   the  Celestial  KinJdom    currently  has  no
maJistrates whatsoever and therefore no  real Mudicial system, ,  deem it
likely that some role can be found for one with your superb Tualifications.”

       “,  see now  why you  desired the little  Jirl's  book so stronJly,”  -udJe
FanJ said. “These younJ ones must all be educated.”

       “,  do  not desire the book itself  so much as , desire its  desiJner—the
artifex Hackworth,” Dr. ;   said. “As lonJ  as the book was somewhere in the
Leased Territories, there was some hope that Hackworth could find it—it is
the one thinJ he desires most. ,f , could have found the book, , could have
extinJuished that hope, and Hackworth would  then have had to  approach
me, either to Jet the book back or to compile another copy.”

       “You  desire some service from Hackworth?”

       “He  is  worth  a  thousand lesser enJineers. And  because of various
hardships over the last few decades, the Celestial KinJdom does not have
even that many  lesser enJineers; they  have all  been lured  away by  the
promise of riches in the Coastal Republic.”

       “,   will   approach Hackworth   tomorrow,”  -udJe  FanJ  said.  “,   will
inform him that the man known to the barbarians as Dr. ; has found the lost
copy of the book.”

       “Good,”  Dr. ;   said, “, shall expect to hear from him.”


                   Hackworth's  dilemma; an unanticipated return  to
                  the hong of Dr. X;  hitherto unseen ramifications  of 
                   Dr.  X's premises; a criminal is brought  to justice. 

191
Hackworth had some time to  run throuJh the loJic  of  the thinJ  one more
time as he waited in the front room of Dr. ;'s honJ, waitinJ  for the old man
to free himself  up from  what sounded like a twelve-way  cine conference.
On his first  visit here he'd been too nervous to see anythinJ, but today he
was settled co]ily in  the cracked leather armchair in the corner, demandinJ
tea from the help and thumbinJ throuJh Dr. ;'s   books. ,t was such a relief
to have nothinJ to lose.

       Since that deeply alarminJ  visit  from ChanJ, Hackworth  had been at
his wits' end. He had made an immense cock-up of the whole thinJ. Sooner
or later  his  crime  would  come out  and his  family   would  be disJraced,
whether or not he Jave money to ChanJ. Even if he somehow manaJed to
Jet the Primer back, his life was ruined.

       When he had received word that Dr. ;  had won the race to recover the
lost copy of the Primer,  the thinJ had turned from  bad to farcical.  He had
cut a  day  at  work  and  Jone  for  a  lonJ  hike  in  the  Royal  EcoloJical
Conservatory. By the time he had returned home, sunburned and pleasantly
exhausted, he had been in a much better mood. That Dr. ; had the Primer
actually improved his situation.

       ,n   exchanJe for   the  Primer,  the  Doctor  would   presumably  want
somethinJ from  Hackworth. ,n  this  case, it  was not  likely  to  be a  mere
bribe, as ChanJ had hinted; all of  the money Hackworth had, or was ever
likely  to make, could not be of  interest to Dr. ;.   ,t  was much more likely
that the Doctor would want some sort of a favor—he miJht ask Hackworth
to desiJn  somethinJ,  to  do  a little   bit  of  consultinJ  work,   as it  were.
Hackworth  wanted so  badly  to   believe this   that  he had  bolstered  the
hypothesis with much evidence, real and phantasmal, durinJ the latter part
of his hike. ,t  was well-known  that the Celestial KinJdom was desperately
far behind in  the nanotechnoloJical arms race; that Dr. ;   himself devoted
his valuable time to rootinJ throuJh the debris of the New Atlantan immune
system proved this. Hackworth's  skills  could  be of  measureless value to
them.

192
       ,f  this  were true, then Hackworth had a way  out. He would  do some
Mob for the Doctor. ,n exchanJe, he would Jet the Primer back, which was
what he wanted more than anythinJ.  As part  of the  deal, Dr. ;   could  no
doubt find some way to eliminate ChanJ from Hackworth's list of  thinJs to
worry about; Hackworth's crime would never be known to his phyle.

         

Victorians  and  Confucians  alike  had  learned  new  uses for   the  foyer,
anteroom, or whatever it  was called, and  for the  old etiTuette of  visitinJ
cards. For that matter, all tribes with sophistication in nanotech understood
that visitors  had to be  carefully examined before  they could  be admitted
into  one's  inner  sanctum,  and  that  such  examination,  carried  out  by
thousands of  assiduous reconnaissance mites,  took  time.  So  elaborate
waitinJ-room etiTuette had flourished, and sophisticated people all over the
world understood that when they called upon someone, even a close friend,
they could expect to spend some time sippinJ tea and perusinJ maJa]ines
in a front room infested with unobtrusive surveillance eTuipment.

       One entire wall  of Dr. ;'s   front room  was a mediatron. Cine feeds, or
simple stationary Jraphics, could be diJitally  posted on such a wall Must as
posters and handbills had been in olden times. Over time, if  not removed,
they tended to overlap each other and build up into an animated collaJe.

       Centered on Dr. ;'s  media wall, partly concealed by newer clips, was a
cine clip as ubiTuitous in northern China as the face of Mao—Buddha's evil
twin—had  been in  the  previous century.  Hackworth  had  never sat  and
watched it  all  the way  throuJh,  but  he'd Jlimpsed  it  so many  times, in
PudonJ taxicabs and on walls in the Leased Territories, that he knew it by
heart. Westerners called it Zhang at the Shang.

       The settinJ  was the front of  a luxury hotel,  one of the archipelaJo of
ShanJri-Las  strunJ   up   the   Kowloon-GuanJ]hou    superhiJhway.   The
horseshoe drive was paved with  interlockinJ   blocks, brass door  handles
Jleamed, thickets of tropical flowers sprouted from boat-si]e planters in the
lobby.  Men  in  business suits  spoke into   cellphones and  checked their

193
watches, white-Jloved  bellhops sprinted  into  the  drive,  pulled  suitcases
from the trunks of red taxicabs, wiped them down with clean moist cloths.

       The horseshoe drive was pluJJed into an eiJht-lane thorouJhfare—not
the hiJhway, but a  mere frontaJe road—with  a spiked iron  fence runninJ
down  the  center to   keep pedestrians from   crossinJ  in  midblock.   The
pavement, new but already crumblinJ, was streaked with red dust washed
down out of the devastated hills of GuanJdonJ by the latest typhoon.

       Traffic   suddenly  became thin,   and  the  camera panned  upstream:
Several lanes had been blocked by a swarm of bicycles. Occasionally a red
taxi or  Mercedes-Ben] would  sTuee]e by  alonJ the iron  fence  and burst
free, the driver  holdinJ  down the  horn button  so furiously  that he  miJht
detonate the air baJ. Hackworth could not hear the sound of the horn, but as
the camera ]oomed in on  the action, it  became possible to see one driver
take his hand off the horn and turn back to  shake his finJer at the mob  of
bicyclists.

       When  he saw  who  was pedalinJ  the lead  bicycle,  he turned  away
nauseous with fear, and his hand collapsed into his lap like a dead Tuail.

       The  leader was a stocky man  with  white hair,  sixtyish but  pumpinJ
away viJorously on an unexceptional black bicycle, wearinJ drab worker's
clothes. He moved it down the street with  deceptive speed and pulled into
the horseshoe drive.  An  embolism  of  bicycles  formed  on  the street  as
hundreds tried to  crowd in  the narrow  entrance. And  here came another
classic moment: The head bellhop skirted his stand-up desk and ran toward
the bicyclist, wavinJ  him off  and hurlinJ abuse in Cantonese—until he Jot
about six feet away and reali]ed he was lookinJ at =hanJ Han Hua.

       At   this  point  =hanJ  had no  Mob title, beinJ  nominally  retired—an
ironical conceit that the Chinese premiers of the late twentieth century and
early  twenty-first  had  perhaps borrowed  from  American  Mafia   bosses.
Perhaps they recoJni]ed that Mob titles were beneath the diJnity of the most
powerful man on earth. People who had Jotten this close to =hanJ claimed
that they never thouJht about his temporal power—the armies, the nuclear

194
weapons, the secret police. All  they  could think  about was  the fact  that,
durinJ the  Great Cultural Revolution,  at the  aJe of  eiJhteen, =hanJ Han
Hua had led his cell of Red Guards into hand-to-hand combat with another
cell that they deemed insufficiently fervid, and that, at the conclusion of the
battle, =hanJ had feasted on the raw flesh of  his late adversaries. No one
could stand face-to-face with =hanJ without imaJininJ the blood streaminJ
down his chin.

       The  bellhop  collapses to his  knees and beJins  literally  kowtowinJ.
=hanJ looks disJusted, hooks one of his sandaled feet under the bellhop's
collarbone, and prods him back upriJht, then speaks a few words to him in
the hillbilly  accent of his native FuMien. The bellhop can hardly bow enouJh
on his way back into the hotel; displeasure reJisters on =hanJ's face—all he
wants is  some fast service. DurinJ   the next  minute or  so, proJressively
hiJher-rankinJ hotel officials  crinJe  out the door  and abase themselves in
front of =hanJ, who simply iJnores them, lookinJ bored now. No one really
knows whether =hanJ is a Confucianist or a Maoist at this point in his life,
but at this  moment it  makes no difference: for  in  the Confucian  view  of
society, as in the Communist, peasants are the hiJhest class and merchants
the lowest. This hotel is not for peasants.

       Finally  a man in a black business suit emerJes, preceded and pursued
by bodyJuards. He looks anJrier than =hanJ, thinkinJ  that he must be the
victim  of  some  unforJivable  practical  Moke. This is  a merchant  amonJ
merchants: the fourteenth richest  man in   the world,  the  third  richest in
China. He owns most of  the real estate within half  an hour's drive  of this
hotel. He does not break his stride as he steps into the drive and recoJni]es
=hanJ; he walks straiJht  up to him  and asks him what he wants, why  the
old man has bothered to  come down from  BeiMinJ and interfere with  his
business on his foolish bicycle ride.

       =hanJ  simply  steps forward  and  speaks a few  words into   the rich
man's ear.

       The rich  man takes a step back, as if  =hanJ has punched him in  the
chest. His mouth is  open, revealinJ flawless white  teeth, his eyes are not

195
focused. After a few moments, he takes another two steps back, which Jives
him enouJh room for  his next maneuver: He stoops, puts one knee down,
then the other, bends forward at the waist until he is on all fours, then settles
himself down full-lenJth   on the nicely  interlocked pavinJ-stones. He puts
his face on the pavement. He kowtows to =hanJ Han Hua.

         

One by one the Dolbyi]ed voices in the next room siJned off until  only Dr.
;   and another Jentleman were left, haJJlinJ  about somethinJ desultorily,
takinJ  lonJ  breaks between volleys  of   tweeter-bustinJ oratory  to  stoke
pipes, pour tea, or whatever these people did when they were pretendinJ to
iJnore each other.  The discussion  petered out rather  than buildinJ   to  a
violent climax  as Hackworth had secretly, mischievously been hopinJ, and
then a younJ fellow  pulled the curtain aside and said, “Dr. ;   will   see you
now.”

       Dr.  ;   was in a lovely,  Jenerous mood probably calculated to convey
the impression  that he'd  always  known  Hackworth  would  be  back. He
rustled to his feet, shook Hackworth's hand warmly, and invited him out to
dinner “at a place nearby,” he said portentously, “of utmost discretion.”

       ,t   was discreet because one of   its  co]y  private  dininJ  rooms  was
connected directly to one of the back rooms of Dr. ;'s establishment, so that
one could reach it  by  walkinJ  down a  sinous inflated  Nanobar tube that
would have  stretched to half  a  kilometer  lonJ  if  you  extricated it   from
ShanJhai, took it to Kansas, and pulled on both ends. STuintinJ throuJh the
translucent walls of  the  tube as he  assisted Dr. ;    to dinner,  Hackworth
cloudily  Jlimpsed several do]en  people pursuinJ  a ranJe of  activities  in
some half-do]en different  buildinJs,  throuJh which  Dr.  ;   had apparently
procured some kind of riJht-of-way.  Finally  it  spat them out into  a nicely
furnished and  carpeted dininJ  room,  which  had  been retrofitted  with  a
powered slidinJ door. The door opened Must as they were sittinJ down, and
Hackworth was almost knocked off balance as the tube snee]ed nanofiltered
wind; a  beaminJ four-foot-tall  waitress stood in  the doorway, closinJ  her
eyes and leaninJ forward aJainst the anticipated wind-blast. ,n perfect San

196
Fernando Valley  EnJlish  she said,  “Would  you  like   to  hear about  our
specials?”

       Dr.  ;    was at  pains to  reassure Hackworth  that he  understood and
sympathi]ed with  his situation; so much so that Hackworth spent much of
the time wonderinJ  whether Dr.  ;   had already  known about it.  “Say  no
more, it  is  taken care of,”   Dr.  ;   finally   said, cuttinJ  Hackworth  off   in
midexplanation, and after that Hackworth  was unable to interest Dr.  ;   in
the topic anymore. This was reassurinJ but unsettlinJ, as he could not avoid
the impression that he had Must somehow aJreed to a deal whose terms had
not been neJotiated or even thouJht about. But Dr. ;'s whole affect seemed
to deliver the messaJe that if you were JoinJ to siJn a Faustian barJain with
an ancient and inscrutable ShanJhainese orJani]ed-crime fiJure, you could
hardly do  better than the avuncular Dr.  ;,   who  was so Jenerous that he
would probably  forJet  about it  altoJether, or perhaps Must stow the favor
away in a yellowed  box in  one of  his warrens. By the end of  the lenJthy
meal, Hackworth  was  so  reassured that he  had almost  forJotten  about
Lieutenant ChanJ and the Primer altoJether.

       8ntil,   that  is,  the door  slid  open aJain to  reveal  Lieutenant ChanJ
himself.

       Hackworth hardly  recoJni]ed him at first,  because he was dressed in a
much more traditional outfit than usual: baJJy indiJo paMamas, sandals, and
a black leather  skullcap that concealed about seventy-five  percent of  his
knotlike  skull.   Also,   he  had  beJun  to  Jrow   his  whiskers   out.  Most
alarminJly, he had a scabbard affixed  to his belt,  and the scabbard had a
sword in it.

       He  stepped into  the room  and  bowed perfunctorily   to  Dr. ;,    then
turned to face Hackworth.

       “Lieutenant ChanJ?” Hackworth said weakly.

       “Constable  ChanJ,”  said  the interloper,  “of   the district   tribunal  of
ShanJhai.”  And  then   he  said  the  Chinese  words  that  meant  Middle
KinJdom.

197
       “,  thouJht you were Coastal Republic.”

       “,  have followed my  master to a new country,” Constable ChanJ said.
“, must reJretfully  place you under arrest now, -ohn Percival Hackworth.”

       “On  what  charJe?” Hackworth said, forcinJ  himself  to chuckle  as if
this were all a biJ practical Moke amonJ close friends.

       “That  on  the —  day  of  —,  21—,  you  did brinJ   stolen intellectual
property into the Celestial KinJdom—  specifically,  into the honJ of  Dr. ;
—and did use that property to  compile an illeJal  copy of  a certain device
known as the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.”

       There was  no point  in  claiminJ  that this  was not  true. “But   ,  have
come here  this  eveninJ  specifically  to  reJain  possession of  that  same
device,” Hackworth said, “which   is in the  hands of my distinJuished host
here. Certainly you are not intendinJ  to arrest the distinJuished Dr.  ;   for
traffickinJ in  stolen property.”

       Constable  ChanJ  looked   expectantly  toward  Dr.   ;.    The  Doctor
adMusted his robes and adopted a radiant, Jrandfatherly smile. “, am sorry to
tell you  that some reprehensible person has apparently provided you with
wronJ information,”  he said. “,n   fact, ,  have no idea where the Primer is
located.”

       The dimensions of  this trap were so vast that  Hackworth's mind was
still reelinJ  throuJh it, bouncinJ  haplessly from one wall to  another, when
he was hauled before the district maJistrate twenty minutes later. They had
set up a courtroom in a larJe, ancient Jarden in the interior of Old ShanJhai.
,t was an open sTuare paved with flat Jray stones. At one end was a raised
buildinJ open to the sTuare on one side, covered with a sweepinJ tile roof
whose corners curved hiJh into  the air  and whose ridJeline  was adorned
with a  clay frie]e   portrayinJ a  couple of  draJons facinJ off  with  a  larJe
pearl between them. Hackworth reali]ed,  dimly, that  this was actually the
staJe of an open-air theatre, which enhanced the impression that he was the
sole spectator at an elaborate play  written  and staJed for  his  benefit.  A
MudJe sat before a low, brocade-covered table in the center of  the staJe,

198
dressed in maJnificent robes and an imposinJ winJed hat decorated with a
unicorn emblem.  Behind him  and off   to one  side stood a  small woman
wearinJ  what   Hackworth  assumed  were  phenomenoscopic spectacles.
When Constable ChanJ had pointed to a spot on the Jray flaJstones where
Hackworth was expected to kneel, he ascended to the staJe and took up a
position flankinJ  the  -udJe  on the other  side. A  few  other functionaries
were arranJed on the sTuare, mostly consistinJ of Dr. ; and members of his
retinue, arranJed in two parallel lines forminJ a tunnel between Hackworth
and the -udJe.

       Hackworth's initial   surJe of terror had worn  off. He had now  entered
into morbid fascination with the incredible dreadfulness of his situation and
the maJnificent  performance  staJed by  Dr.  ;    to  celebrate it.  He  knelt
silently and waited in  a stunned, hyper-relaxed state, like a pithed froJ on
the dissection table.

       Formalities  were  Jone  throuJh.  The  -udJe   was named  FanJ  and
evidently came from New York.  The charJe was repeated, somewhat more
elaborately. The woman stepped forward and introduced evidence: a cine
record that was played on a larJe mediatron coverinJ the back wall  of the
staJe. ,t was a film of the suspect, -ohn Percival Hackworth, slicinJ a bit of
skin from his hand and JivinJ it  to (the innocent) Dr. ;,   who (not knowinJ
that he was beinJ Julled into committinJ a theft) extracted a terabyte of hot
data from a cocklebur-shaped mite, and so on, and so on.

       “The  only  thinJ  that  remains is to  prove that  this  information  was,
indeed, stolen—thouJh this is stronJly  implied by  the suspect's behavior,”
-udJe FanJ  said. ,n  support  of  this  assertion, Constable ChanJ stepped
forward and told the story of his visit to Hackworth's flat.

       “Mr.  Hackworth,”  said -udJe FanJ, “would you like to dispute that this
property was  stolen? ,f  so, we  will   hold  you  here while  a  copy of  the
information is supplied to  Her MaMesty's Police; they can confer with your
employer to determine whether you did anythinJ dishonest. Would you like
us to do that?”

199
       “No,  Your Honour,” Hackworth said.

       “So  you are not  disputinJ that  the property was stolen, and that you
deceived a  subMect of the Celestial  KinJdom   into  colludinJ  with   your
criminal behavior?”

       “,  am Juilty  as charJed, Your Honour,” Hackworth said, “and ,  throw
myself on the mercy of the court.”

       “Very  well,”  -udJe FanJ said, “the defendant is Juilty. The sentence is
sixteen strokes of the cane and ten years' imprisonment.”

       “Goodness Jracious!” Hackworth murmured. ,nadeTuate as this was, it
was the only thinJ that came to him.

       “,nsofar  as the strokes of the cane are concerned, since the defendant
was motivated by his filial  responsibility to his  dauJhter, , will  suspend all
but one, on one condition.”

       “Your  Honour, ,  shall  endeavour to comply with  whatever condition
you may choose to impose.”

       “That  you supply Dr. ;  with  the decryption key to the data in Tuestion,
so that additional copies of  the book may  be made available to the small
children crowdinJ our orphanaJes.”

       “This  , will  Jladly do,”  Hackworth said, “but there are complications.”

       “,'m  waitinJ,”  -udJe FanJ said, not soundinJ very pleased. Hackworth
Jot the impression that this business about the caninJ and the Primer was a
mere prelude to somethinJ  biJJer, and that  the -udJe  Must wanted to Jet
throuJh it.

       “,n   order for  me  to weiJh  the  seriousness of these complications,”
Hackworth said,  “,  will   need to know  how  many copies, approximately,
Your Honour intends to make.”

200
       “,n  the ranJe of hundreds of thousands.”

       Hundreds of  thousands! “Please excuse me,  but does Your  Honour
understand that the book is enJineered for Jirls startinJ  around the aJe of
four?”

       “Yes.”

       Hackworth  was taken  aback. Hundreds of  thousands of  children of
both sexes and all aJes would not have been difficult to believe. Hundreds
of thousands of four-year-old Jirls was hard for the mind to Jrasp. -ust one
of them was Tuite a handful. But it was, after all, China.

       “The maJistrate is waitinJ,”  Constable ChanJ said.

       “,  must make it clear to Your Honour that the Primer is, in larJe part, a
ractive—that is, it  reTuires the participation of adult ractors. While  one or
two  extra  copies miJht   Jo  unnoticed,  a  larJe  number of   them would
overwhelm the built-in system provided for payinJ for such services.”

       “Then  part  of your  responsibility  will   be to  make alterations in  the
Primer so that it is suitable for our reTuirements—we can make do without
those parts of the book that depend heavily on outside ractors, and supply
our own ractors in some cases,” -udJe FanJ said.

       “This   should be feasible.  ,  can build  in  automatic voice-Jeneration
capabilities—not as Jood,  but  serviceable.” At   this point,  -ohn  Percival
Hackworth, almost without  thinkinJ  about it  and without appreciatinJ  the
ramifications of what he was doinJ,  devised a trick and slipped it in  under
the radar of the -udJe and Dr. ;   and all of  the other people in the theatre,
who were  better at  noticinJ  tricks  than most other  people in  the world.
“While  ,'m at  it, if  it  pleases the court, , can also,” Hackworth  said, most
obseTuiously, “make chanJes in the content so that it will be more suitable
for the uniTue cultural reTuirements of the Han readership. But it will  take
some time.”

201
       “Very  well,”   said  -udJe  FanJ, “all   but  one stroke  of  the cane are
suspended, pendinJ the completion of these alterations. As for the ten years
of imprisonment, ,  am embarrassed to relate that this  district,  beinJ very
small, does not have a prison, and so the suspect will have to  be released
this eveninJ after the business with  the cane is finished. But  rest assured,
Mr. Hackworth, that your sentence will be served, one way or another.”

       The  revelation  that  he  would  be  released to  his  family   this  very
eveninJ hit  Hackworth  like  a deep lunJful  of  opium  smoke. The caninJ
went by  Tuickly  and efficiently;  he did  not  have time to  worry  about it,
which helped a little.  The pain sent him  straiJht into shock. ChanJ pulled
his flaccid body off  the rack and bore him over to a hard cot, where he lay
semiconscious for a few minutes. They  brouJht him  tea—a nice Keemun
with distinct lavender notes.

       Without   further  ado  he  was  escorted straiJht   out  of   the  Middle
KinJdom and into the streets of the Coastal Republic, which had never been
more than a stone's throw away from him  durinJ all  of these proceedinJs,
but which miJht  as well have been a thousand miles and a thousand years
distant. He made his way straiJht to a public matter compiler, movinJ  in a
broad-based Jait, with tiny steps, bent over somewhat, and compiled some
first-aid supplies—painkillers and some hæmocules that supposedly helped
to knit wounds toJether.

       ThouJhts about the second part of the sentence, and how he miJht end
up servinJ it,  did not come back to  him until  he was halfway  back across
the Causeway, borne swiftly on  autoskates, the wind keeninJ throuJh the
fabric of his  trousers and inflaminJ the laceration placed neatly across his
buttocks, like the track of a router. This time, he was surrounded by a flock
of hornet-si]e  aerostats flyinJ  in an ellipsoidal  formation  all  around him,
hissinJ Jently and invisibly  throuJh the niJht  and waitinJ for  an excuse to
swarm.

       This defensive system, which had seemed formidable to him when he
compiled it, now seemed like a pathetic Jesture. ,t miJht stop a youth JanJ.
But he had insensibly transcended the plane of petty delinTuents and moved

202
into a new realm, ruled by powers almost entirely hidden from his ken, and
knowable to  the likes  of  -ohn  Percival  Hackworth  only  insofar  as they
perturbed the  traMectories of the insiJnificant   persons and  powers who
happened to be in  his vicinity.   He  could do  nauJht but  continue fallinJ
throuJh the orbit  that had been ordained for him. This  knowledJe relaxed
him  more  than anythinJ  he  had  learned in  many  years,  and when  he
returned home, he kissed the sleepinJ Fiona, treated his wounds with more
therapeutic technoloJy from the M.C., covered them with paMamas, and slid
beneath the covers. Drawn inward by Gwendolyn's dark radiant warmth, he
fell asleep before he had even had time to pray.


                   More tales from the Primer;  the story of Dinosaur
                   and Dojo; Nell  learns a thing or two about the art 
                     of self-defense; Nell's mother gets, and loses, a 
                    worthy suitor;  Nell asserts her position against a 
                                                 young bully. 



She loved all  of  her  four  companions, but her  favorite  had come  to be
Dinosaur. At  first  she'd found him  a  little  scary, but then  she'd come to
understand that thouJh he could be a terrible  warrior, he was on  her side
and he loved her. She loved to ask him for stories about the old days before
the Extinction,  and about the time he  had spent studyinJ with  the mouse
DoMo.

TKere were otKer  students  too …

 

       said the book,  speakinJ in Dinosaur's voice, as Nell  sat by herself in
the corner of the playroom.

       Nell  lauJhed to think  of a little  Jirl  monkey flippinJ   a Jreat dinosaur
over her shoulder. She went back one paJe and reread the last part  more
carefully:

A couSOe oI days  Oater, wKen BeOOe came back to  our  cave  OookLnJ

       An  illustration  materiali]ed  on  the facinJ  paJe. Nell  recoJni]ed  the
open space in front of the entrance to DoMo's cave. DoMo was sittinJ up on a
hiJh rock JivinJ  instructions to Dinosaur and Belle. Dinosaur tried  to do a

205
somersault, but his  tiny  front  arms could  not  support the  weiJht  of  his
massive head, and he fell flat on his face. Then Belle Jave it a try and did a
perfect somersault.

       Nell  tried  it   too. ,t   was confusinJ  at first,   because the world  kept
spinninJ around her while  she did it.  She looked at  the illustration  in the
book and saw Belle  doinJ exactly  what Nell  had done, makinJ all  of  the
same mistakes. DoMo scampered down from his rock and explained how
Belle could keep her head and body  straiJht. Nell  followed  the advice as
she Jave it another try, and this time it felt  better. Before her time was up,
she was doinJ perfect somersaults all over the playJround. When she went
back to   the  apartment, Mom   wouldn't  let  her  in   at  first,   so she  did
somersaults up and down the hall for a while. Finally  Mom  let her in, and
when she saw that Nell had Jotten sand in her hair and shoes down at the
playJround, she Jave her a spankinJ and sent her to bed without any food.

       But the next morninJ  she went to the M.C. and asked it for the special
meal DoMo made for Belle. The M.C. said it couldn't really make fish, but it
could make nanosurimi, which was kind of like fish. ,t could make rice too.
VeJetables were a problem. ,nstead it Jave her some Jreen paste she could
eat with a spoon. Nell  told the M.C.  that this was her Belle  food and that
she was JoinJ to have it all the time  from now  on, and after that the M.C.
always knew what she wanted.

       Nell  didn't call  it  her maJic book anymore, she called it by  the name
printed plain as day on  the title  paJe, which she'd only  been able to read
recently:

 

                       YO8NG  LADY'S  ILL8STRATED   PRIMER
                                    a Propædeutic Enchiridion 
                                     in  which is told  the tale of 
                                                Princess Nell 
                      and her  various friends,  kin,  associates, &c..

206
 

        The Primer  didn't  speak to her as often as it used to.  She had found that
she could often  read the words  more Tuickly  than  the book  spoke them, and
so she usually  ordered it  to  be silent.  She often  put it  under  her pillow   and
had it read her bedtime  stories,  thouJh, and  sometimes she even woke  up in
the middle  of  the  niJht  and  heard it  whisperinJ   thinJs  to  her  that she  had
Must been dreaminJ about.

        Tad had lonJ  since vanished from  their  home, thouJh  not before  JivinJ
Mom  a broken nose. He'd  been replaced by  Shemp, who  had been replaced
by Todd,  who  had  Jiven   way  to  Tony.  One day  the  ShanJhai  Police  had
come to  arrest  Tony,  and he  had  pluJJed  one  of  them  riJht   in  the livinJ
room  with   his   skull  Jun,   blowinJ    a  hole  in   the  Juy's  stomach   so  that
intestines fell   out and  trailed  down  between  his leJs.  The  other  policemen
nailed Tony  with   a Seven Minute   Special and  then draJJed  their  wounded
comrade out  into  the hallway,  while   Tony, bellowinJ   like  a  cornered, rabid
animal,  ran into  the  kitchen  and  Jrabbed a  knife  and beJan  hackinJ  at  his
chest where  he thouJht  the  Seven Minute   Special  had Jone  into  his  body.
By  the time  the  seven minutes  had Jone  by  and the  policemen  burst  back
into  the  apartment,  he had  duJ  a hole  in  his  pectoral  muscle   all  the way
down to  his ribs. He  menaced the cops with  his bloody  knife,  and the  cop in
charJe punched in  some numbers on a little  black  box in  his hand,  and Tony
buckled  and screamed as a  sinJle  cookie-cutter   detonated inside  his  thiJh.
He dropped   the knife.   The  cops  rushed in  and  shrink-wrapped   him,   then
stood around his body,  mummified   in JlisteninJ   plastic,  and kicked  him and
stomped him  for   a minute  or  two,  then  finally   cut  a hole  in  the plastic  so
Tony  could  breathe.  They  bonded  four  handles  onto  the  shrink-wrap   and
then carried him  out between  them, leavinJ  Nell  to clean  up the blood  in the
kitchen and  the livinJ   room.  She wasn't very  Jood at  cleaninJ  thinJs  up yet
and ended up smearinJ  it  around. When  Mom  Jot  home,  she screamed and
cried for  a while  and then  spanked Nell  for  makinJ  a mess. This  made Nell
sad, and so she went  to her  room  and picked  up the  Primer  and made up  a
story of  her own,  about how  the wicked  stepmother  had made Princess Nell
clean up  the  house and  had  spanked  her for   doinJ  it  wronJ.   The  Primer
made up pictures  as she went  alonJ.  By the  time  she was finished,  she had

207
forJotten about the real thinJs that had happened and remembered only the
story she had made up.

       After   that, Mom  swore  off  men for  a  while,  but  after  a couple  of
months she met a Juy named Brad who was actually nice. He had a real Mob
as a blacksmith in  the New  Atlantis  Clave, and one day  he took  Nell to
work with him  and showed her how he nailed iron shoes onto the hooves of
the horses. This was the first time Nell had actually seen a horse, and so she
did not  pay  much attention  to  Brad and  his  hammers and nails.  Brad's
employers had a Jiant house with vast Jreen fields, and they had four kids,
all biJJer  than Nell,  who would  come out in fancy  clothes and ride those
horses.

       But  Mom  broke  up  with  Brad;  she didn't  like  craftsmen, she said,
because they were too  much like   actual Victorians,  always spoutinJ  all
kinds of  crap about how  one thinJ  was better  than another thinJ,  which
eventually led, she explained,  to the  belief that  some people were better
than others. She took up with a Juy named Burt who  eventually moved in
with them. Burt explained to Nell and Harv that the house needed discipline
and that he intended to provide  it, and after  that he spanked them all  the
time, sometimes on the butt and sometimes on the face. He spanked Mom a
lot too.

       Nell  was spendinJ much more  time at  the playJround, where it  was
easier for her to do all of the exercises that DoMo was teachinJ to Belle. She
also played James with the other kids sometimes. One day she was playinJ
tetherball with a friend of hers and kept beatinJ her every time. Then a boy
came up, a boy biJJer than either Nell or her friend, and insisted that he be
allowed to  play.  Nell's  friend  Jave  up her  place, and  then Nell   played
aJainst the boy, whose name was Kevin. Kevin  was a biJ  solid  boy who
was proud of his bulk and his strenJth, and his philosophy of tetherball was
winninJ   throuJh   intimidation.    He   would    Jrab   the   ball,   wind    up
melodramatically, barinJ  his  teeth and  JettinJ  his  face briJht   red, then
smash the ball with   a windmill   punch, complete with  sound  effects that
always showered the ball with spit. The performance was so impressive that
many children Must stood and watched it in awe, afraid to Jet in the way of

208
the tetherball, and after that Kevin would Must keep smashinJ the ball faster
and faster on each revolution while vomitinJ profanity at his opponent. Nell
knew that Kevin's  mom had lived  with  a lot  of the same Juys that  Nell's
mom had  lived  with;  he freTuently  sported black  eyes that he  certainly
hadn't Jotten on the playJround.

       Nell  had always been afraid of  Kevin. But  today when he wound  up
for his biJ  serve, he Must looked silly; kind of like Dinosaur did sometimes
when sparrinJ with Belle.  The ball  swunJ toward her, dewy with  spit and
not really JoinJ all  that fast. Kevin was shoutinJ thinJs at her, callinJ her a
cunt and other words, but for some reason Nell didn't hear it and didn't care,
she Must lunJed toward the ball and punched it hard, puttinJ her whole body
behind her knuckles in a straiJht line, Must as DoMo tauJht. She hit the ball so
hard, she didn't even feel it; it shot up in a wide arc that took it  behind and
above Kevin's head, and after that all she had to do was Jive it a few more
slaps as it whi]]ed by, and she'd won the Jame.

       “Two  out of  three,” Kevin  said, and they played aJain, with the same
result. Now  all  the kids were  lauJhinJ  at Kevin,  and he lost  his temper,
turned briJht red, and charJed at Nell.

       But Nell  had watched Kevin use this tactic on other kids, and she knew
that it only worked because usually the kids were too scared to move. DoMo
had explained to Belle that the best way to fiJht Dinosaur was simply to Jet
out of his way  and let his own strenJth defeat him, so that's what Nell did
with Kevin: stepped aside at the last minute, made one foot into a hook, and
tripped him. Kevin smashed tremendously into a swinJset, Jathered himself
up, and charJed a second time. Nell dodJed him and tripped him aJain.

       “Okay,”  Kevin  said, “you  win.”   He approached Nell holdinJ  out his
riJht hand to shake. But Nell  had seen this one too, and she knew it was a
trick. She reached out with her riJht hand as if she were JoinJ to shake. But
as Kevin was JropinJ at this bait, every muscle in his arm tense, Nell turned
her palm toward the floor  and drew  her hand down, then back across the
middle of  her body. She was watchinJ Kevin as she did this  and saw that
his eyes were trackinJ her hand, mesmeri]ed.  She continued to move her

209
hand around in a lonJ ellipse, turninJ her palm upward, thrustinJ it forward,
pokinJ her finJers into Kevin's starinJ eyes.

       He put his hands to his face. She kicked him between the leJs as hard
as she could, takinJ her time  and strikinJ  the tarJet precisely. As he bent
over, she Jrabbed his hair and kneed him in the face, then shoved him down
on his  butt  and  left  him  there, too  surprised,  for  the  moment, to  start
bawlinJ.


                     Hackworth  lunches in distinguished  company;
                  a disquisition  on hypocrisy; Hackworth's  situation 
                                    develops new complications. 



Hackworth arrived at the pub first.  He Jot a pint of  porter at the bar, cask-
conditioned stuff from the nearby Dovetail community, and strolled around
the place for a few  minutes while he waited. He  had been fidJetinJ at his
desk all morninJ and enMoyed the opportunity to stretch his leJs. The place
was done up like  an ancient London  publican house circa World  War ,,,
complete with fake bomb damaJe to one corner of the structure and taped
;'s  over  each windowpane—which only made Hackworth  think of  Dr. ;.
AutoJraphed photos of British and American  airmen were stuck up on the
walls here and there, alonJ with  other miscellany  recallinJ  the heyday of
AnJlo-American cooperation:

       Bowler  hats hunJ in  clusters from poles and wall  hooks all  over the
room, like Jreat  bunches of black Jrapes. A lot  of enJineers and artifexes
seemed to come to this place. They hunched over pints of  beer at the bar
and delved  into  steak-and-kidney pies  at  the little   tables,  chattinJ  and
chucklinJ. There was nothinJ prepossessinJ about the place or its patrons,
but Hackworth  knew  that  the  odds and  ends of  nanotechnoloJical lore
collected in the  heads of these middle-class artisans was what ultimately
kept New Atlantis wealthy and secure. He had to ask himself why he hadn't
been satisfied with  simply  beinJ  one of  them. -ohn  Percival  Hackworth
proMected his thouJhts into matter and did it better than anyone else in this
place. But he had felt the need to Jo beyond that—he had wanted to reach
beyond mere matter and into someone's soul.

       Now, whether he wanted to or not, he was JoinJ to reach hundreds of
thousands of souls.

       The men at the tables watched him curiously, then nodded politely and
looked away when he cauJht their eye. Hackworth had noticed a full-lane
Rolls-Royce parked in front of the place on his way in. Someone important
was here, evidently in  a back room.  Hackworth and everyone else in  the
place knew   it,  and  they  were  all   in   a  heiJhtened state  of  alertness,
wonderinJ what was up.

       MaMor Napier rode up on a standard-issue cavalry chevaline and came
in at noon on the dot, pullinJ off his officer's hat and exchanJinJ a hilarious
JreetinJ with  the  barkeep. Hackworth recoJni]ed  him  because he was a
hero, and  Napier  recoJni]ed  Hackworth   for  reasons left   provocatively
unspecified.

       Hackworth  translated his  pint to  the  left  and exchanJed a viJorous
handshake with MaMor Napier in front of the bar. They strolled toward the
back of  the place, exchanJinJ  some hearty, forJettable, balderdash-laden
banter. Napier stepped nimbly in front of him and pulled open a small door
in the back wall. Three steps led down into a little snuJJery with mullioned
windows on three sides and a sinJle copper-covered table in the middle. A
man was sittinJ by  himself  at the table, and as Hackworth  descended the

211
steps, he reali]ed that it  was Lord  Alexander ChunJ-Sik  Finkle-McGraw,
who stood up, returned his bow, and Jreeted him with  a warm  and hearty
handshake, takinJ such evident measures to put Hackworth at ease that, in
some respects, the opposite result was achieved.

       More  banter, a  bit  more  restrained. A  waiter  came  in;  Hackworth
ordered a steak sandwich, today's special, and Napier simply nodded to the
waiter to  indicate  his  complete aJreement, which  Hackworth  took  as a
friendly Jesture. Finkle-McGraw declined to eat anythinJ.

       Hackworth  was not  really  hunJry  anymore. ,t  was clear  that Royal
-oint Forces Command had fiJured out at least some of what had happened,
and that Finkle-McGraw knew about it  too. They had decided to approach
him privately  instead of simply lowerinJ  the boom on  him and drumminJ
him out of the phyle. This should have filled him  with boundless relief, but
it didn't. ThinJs had seemed so simple after his prosecution in the Celestial
KinJdom.  Now   he  suspected they  were  about  to  Jet   infinitely   more
complicated.

       “Mr.   Hackworth,”   Finkle-McGraw   said  after  the  pleasantries  had
petered out, speakinJ in a new tone of  voice, a the-meetinJ-will-come-to-
order sort of voice, “please favour me with your opinion of hypocrisy.”

       “Excuse me. Hypocrisy, Your Grace?”

       “Yes. You know.”

       “,t's  a vice, , suppose.”

       “A   little  one or  a biJ  one? Think  carefully—much  hinJes upon  the
answer.”

       “,  suppose that depends upon the particular circumstances.”

       “That  will  never fail  to be a safe answer, Mr. Hackworth,” the ETuity
Lord said reproachfully.  MaMor Napier lauJhed, somewhat artificially, not
knowinJ what to make of this line of inTuiry.

212
       “Recent events in my life have renewed my appreciation for the virtues
of  doinJ  thinJs  safely,”   Hackworth  said.  Both  of  the  others  chuckled
knowinJly.

       “You  know, when , was a younJ man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst
of vices,” Finkle-McGraw said. “,t  was all because of moral relativism. You
see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed  to criticise  others—after
all, if  there is no absolute riJht  and wronJ, then what Jrounds is there for
criticism?”

       Finkle-McGraw  paused, knowinJ that he had the full   attention of his
audience, and beJan  to  withdraw   a  calabash pipe  and various  related
supplies and implements from his pockets. As he continued, he charJed the
calabash with a blend  of  leather-brown tobacco so redolent  that it  made
Hackworth's mouth water.  He was  tempted to spoon some of  it  into  his
mouth.

       “Now,  this  led  to a  Jood deal of  Jeneral frustration,  for  people are
naturally  censorious  and  love  nothinJ   better  than  to   criticise   others'
shortcominJs. And so it  was that they sei]ed on hypocrisy  and elevated it
from a ubiTuitous  peccadillo into  the monarch of  all  vices. For, you  see,
even if there is no riJht and wronJ, you can find Jrounds to criticise another
person by contrastinJ what he has espoused with what he has actually done.
,n  this  case, you  are  not  makinJ  any  MudJment whatsoever as to  the
correctness of his views or the morality  of his behaviour—you  are merely
pointinJ  out  that he  has said  one thinJ  and  done another. Virtually   all
political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferretinJ out
of hypocrisy.

       “You   wouldn't   believe   the  thinJs   they   said  about   the  oriJinal
Victorians. CallinJ   someone a Victorian   in  those days  was almost  like
callinJ them a fascist or a Na]i.”

       Both Hackworth  and MaMor Napier were dumbfounded. “Your Grace!”
Napier exclaimed.  “,   was  naturally  aware that  their   moral  stance was

213
radically different from  ours—but , am astonished to be informed that they
actually condemned the first Victorians.”

       “Of  course they did,” Finkle-McGraw said.

       “Because  the  first   Victorians   were  hypocrites,”   Hackworth   said,
JettinJ it.

       Finkle-McGraw   beamed upon  Hackworth   like   a  master upon  his
favored  pupil.  “As   you   can  see, MaMor Napier,  my   estimate of   Mr.
Hackworth's mental acuity was not ill-founded.”

       “While   , would  never have supposed otherwise, Your Grace,” MaMor
Napier said, “it   is nonetheless JratifyinJ  to  have seen a demonstration.”
Napier raised his Jlass in Hackworth's direction.

       “Because they  were hypocrites,”  Finkle-McGraw  said, after  iJnitinJ
his calabash and shootinJ a few tremendous fountains of smoke into the air,
“the Victorians  were despised in  the late twentieth  century. Many  of  the
persons who  held  such  opinions  were,  of  course,  Juilty   of   the  most
nefandous conduct themselves, and yet saw no  paradox in  holdinJ  such
views because they were not hypocrites  themselves—they took no moral
stances and lived by none.”

       “So  they  were morally   superior to  the Victorians—”   MaMor Napier
said, still a bit snowed under.

       “—even thouJh—in  fact, because—they had no morals at all.”

       There was  a moment of  silent,  bewildered head-shakinJ around the
copper table.

       “We  take a  somewhat different view  of  hypocrisy,”  Finkle-McGraw
continued. “,n the late-twentieth-century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite was
someone who espoused hiJh moral views as part of a planned campaiJn of
deception—he never held  these beliefs  sincerely  and routinely   violated

214
them in privacy. Of  course, most hypocrites are not like  that. Most of  the
time it's a spirit-is-willinJ,  flesh-is-weak sort of thinJ.”

       “That   we occasionally  violate  our  own  stated moral  code,”  MaMor
Napier said, workinJ  it  throuJh, “does not  imply  that we are insincere in
espousinJ that code.”

       “Of  course not,”  Finkle-McGraw  said. “,t's  perfectly  obvious, really.
No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct. Really,
the difficulties  involved—the missteps we make alonJ the way—are  what
make it interestinJ.  The internal,  and eternal, struJJle,  between our base
impulses  and   the  riJorous   demands  of   our   own   moral   system   is
Tuintessentially human. ,t is how we conduct ourselves in that struJJle that
determines how we may in time be MudJed by a hiJher power.”

       All   three men were Tuiet for  a few  moments, chewinJ mouthfuls  of
beer or smoke, ponderinJ the matter.

       “,   cannot help  but infer,”   Hackworth  finally  said, “that  the  present
lesson in comparative ethics—which ,  thouJht  was nicely articulated  and
for which  , am  Jrateful—must be thouJht  to pertain, in  some way, to my
situation.”

       The other men raised their eyebrows in a not very convincinJ  display
of mild  astonishment. The ETuity Lord  turned toward MaMor Napier, who
took the floor briskly and cheerfully.

       “We  do not know  all the  particulars of your  situation—as you know,
Atlantan subMects are entitled to polite treatment from all branches of H.M.'s
-oint Forces unless they violate  the tribal  norms, and that means, in part,
that we  don't  Jo  round  puttinJ  people  under hiJh-res  surveillance  Must
because we  are  curious  about  their,  er,  avocations.  ,n   an  era  when
everythinJ can be surveiled, all we have left is politeness. However, we do
Tuite naturally monitor  cominJs  and JoinJs  throuJh the  border. And not
lonJ aJo, our curiosity  was piTued by the arrival of  one Lieutenant ChanJ
of  the District  MaJistrate's  Office.  He  was also  clutchinJ  a plastic  baJ

215
containinJ a rather battered top hat. Lieutenant ChanJ proceeded directly to
your flat, spent half an hour there, and departed, minus the hat.”

       The steak sandwiches arrived at the beJinninJ of this bit of exposition.
Hackworth beJan messinJ about with condiments, as if he could belittle the
importance of this conversation by payinJ eTual attention to havinJ Must the
riJht Joodies on his  sandwich. He fussed with his pickle  for a while,  then
beJan examininJ the bottles of obscure sauces arrayed in the center of the
table, like a sommelier appraisinJ a wine cellar.

       “,   had  been  muJJed  in   the  Leased Territories,”   Hackworth  said
absently, “and Lieutenant ChanJ recovered my hat, somewhat later, from a
ruffian.” He had fixed his Ja]e,  for no special reason, on a tall bottle with a
paper label  printed  in  an  ancient  crabbed typeface.  “McWHORTER'S
ORIGINAL  CONDIMENT”    was written larJe, and everythinJ else was too
small to read. The  neck of  the bottle was also  festooned with black-and-
white  reproductions  of  ancient  medals  awarded  by  pre-EnliJhtenment
European monarchs at exhibitions in places like RiJa. -ust a bit  of violent
shakinJ and thwackinJ  eMected a few spurts of the ochre slurry from  the
pore-si]e orifice  at the top of  the bottle, which  was Juarded by a Tuarter-
inch  encrustation. Most  of  it   hit  his  plate,  and some  impacted on  his
sandwich.

       “Yes,”  MaMor Napier said, reachinJ into his breast pocket and takinJ
out a folded sheet of smart foolscap. He told it to uncrease itself on the table
and prodded it with the nib  of a silver  fountain pen the si]e of  an artillery
shell. “Gatehouse records indicate  that you  do not  venture into  the  L.T.
often, Mr. Hackworth, which is certainly understandable and speaks well of
your MudJment. There have been two forays in recent months. On the first of
these, you left  in  midafternoon and returned  late at  niJht  bleedinJ from
lacerations that seemed to have been recently incurred, accordinJ to the”—
MaMor Napier could not repress a tiny smile—“evocative description loJJed
by the border patrol officer on duty that niJht. On the second occasion, you
aJain left  in the afternoon and returned late,  this time  with  a sinJle deep
laceration across the buttocks—not  visible,  of  course, but  picked up  by
surveillance.”

216
       Hackworth  took a bite of  his sandwich, correctly anticipatinJ that  the
meat would be Jristly and that he would have plenty of time to think  about
his situation while his molars subdued it. He did  have plenty of time,  as it
turned out; but as freTuently happened to him in these situations, he could
not brinJ his mind  to bear on the subMect at hand. All he could think about
was the taste of the sauce. ,f the manifest of inJredients on  the bottle had
been leJible, it would have read somethinJ like this:

       Water, blackstrap molasses, imported  habanero peppers, salt, Jarlic,
JinJer, tomato puree, axle Jrease, real hickory smoke, snuff, butts of clove
ciJarettes,  Guinness Stout   fermentation  dreJs,   uranium  mill    tailinJs,
muffler   cores,  monosodium  Jlutamate,   nitrates,  nitrites,   nitrotes  and
nitrutes, nutrites, natrotes, powdered pork nose hairs, dynamite,  activated
charcoal,  match-heads, used   pipe  cleaners,  tar,   nicotine,   sinJle-malt
whiskey, smoked beef lymph nodes, autumn leaves, red fuminJ nitric acid,
bituminous coal,  fallout,  printer's ink,  laundry  starch, drain cleaner, blue
chrysotile asbestos, carraJeenan, BHA, BHT, and natural flavorinJs.

       He could not  help smilinJ at his  own complete haplessness, both now
and on the niJht  in  Tuestion. “,  will   concede that my  recent trips to  the
Leased Territories have not  left   me disposed to  make  any more.”  This
comment produced Must the riJht sort of clubby, knowinJ  smiles from his
interlocutors. Hackworth continued, “, saw no reason to report the muJJinJ
to Atlantan authorities—”

       “There  was no  reason,” MaMor Napier said. “ShanJhai Police  miJht
have been interested, thouJh.”

       “Ah.  Well,  ,  did not  report it  to them either, simply  because of their
reputation.”

       This  bit of  routine woJ-bashinJ would  have elicited nauJhty lauJhter
from most. Hackworth  was struck by the fact  that neither Finkle-McGraw
nor Napier rose to the bait.

       “And  yet,”  Napier said, “Lieutenant ChanJ belied that  reputation, did
he not, when he went to the trouble of brinJinJ your hat—now worthless—

217
to you in person, when he was off-duty, rather than simply mailinJ it or for
that matter throwinJ it away.”

       “Yes,”  Hackworth said, “, suppose he did.”

       “We  found it rather sinJular. While  we would  not dream of enTuirinJ
into  the particulars  of  your  conversation  with  Lieutenant  ChanJ, or  of
pryinJ into  your affairs  in any  other way, it  did occur to  some suspicious
minds here—ones that have perhaps been exposed to the Oriental milieu for
too  lonJ—that   Lieutenant   ChanJ's  intentions   miJht   not   be  entirely
honourable, and that he miJht  bear watchinJ. At  the same time, for  your
own protection, we decided to keep a motherly eye on you durinJ any later
soMourns beyond the doJ pod Jrid.” Napier did some more scrawlinJ on his
paper. Hackworth watched his pale  blue eyes MumpinJ back and forth as
various records materiali]ed on its surface.

       “You  took one more trip to the Leased Territories—actually, across the
Causeway, across PudonJ, into  the old   city  of  ShanJhai,”  Napier  said,
“where our surveillance machinery either  malfunctioned or was destroyed
by countermeasures. You returned several hours later with a  chunk taken
out of  your arse.”  Napier suddenly slapped the paper down  on his  desk,
looked up at Hackworth for the first time in Tuite a while, blinkinJ  his eyes
a couple  of  times  as he  refocused, and relaxed  aJainst the  sadistically
desiJned wooden back of his chair. “Hardly the first time  that one of H.M.
subMects has Jone for a nocturnal prowl on the wild  side  and come back
havinJ suffered a beatinJ—but normally the beatinJs are much less severe,
and normally they are bouJht and paid for by the victim. My assessment of
you, Mr. Hackworth, is that you are not interested in that particular vice.”

       “Your  assessment is correct, sir,”  Hackworth  said, a  bit  hotly.  This
self-vindication left  him  in  the position  of havinJ  to provide  some better
explanation of the puckered cicatrice runninJ across his buttocks. Actually,
he didn't have to  explain anythinJ—this  was an informal  luncheon, not a
police   interroJation—but   it    would    not   do   much   for    his   already
tatterdemalion credibility   if   he  let  it   pass without  comment.  As  if   to
emphasi]e this fact, both of the other men were now silent for some time.

218
       “Do   you  have any  more recent  intelliJence  about the  man  named
ChanJ?” Hackworth asked.

       “,t   is   sinJular  that  you   should  ask.  As  it   happens, the  whilom
Lieutenant; his   colleaJue, a  woman  named Pao;  and  their  superior,  a
maJistrate named FanJ, all resiJned on the same day, about a month aJo.
They have resurfaced in the Middle KinJdom.”

       “You  must have been struck by the coincidence—that a MudJe who is
in the habit of caninJ people enters the service of the Middle KinJdom, and
shortly thereafter, a New Atlantan enJineer returns from a visit to said clave
bearinJ marks of havinJ been caned.”

       “Now  that you mention it, it is Tuite strikinJ,”  MaMor Napier said.

       The ETuity Lord  said, “,t miJht  lead one to conclude that the enJineer
in Tuestion owed some debt to a powerful fiJure within that clave, and that
the Mudicial system was beinJ used as a sort of collection aJency.”

       Napier  was ready for  his leJ  of the  relay. “Such an  enJineer, if one
existed, miJht be surprised to know that -ohn =aibatsu is intensely curious
about the ShanJhainese Jentleman in Tuestion—an honest-to-Jod Mandarin
of the Celestial KinJdom,  if  he is  who we  think he is—and  that we have
been tryinJ for  some time, with  little  success, to obtain more information
about his activities. So, if the ShanJhainese Jentleman were to reTuest that
our enJineer partake in activities that we would normally consider unethical
or even treasonous, we miJht take an uncharacteristically forJivinJ stance.
Provided, that is, that the enJineer kept us well-informed.”

       “,   see. Would that  be somethinJ  like  beinJ  a double  aJent, then?”
Hackworth said.

       Napier winced,  as if he were beinJ  caned himself. “,t  is a crashinJly
unsubtle phrase. But , can forJive your usinJ it in this context.”

       “Would  -ohn =aibatsu then make some kind of formal commitment to
this arranJement?”

219
       “,t  is not done that way,” MaMor Napier said.

       “,  was afraid of that,” Hackworth said.

       “Typically   such commitments are  superfluous, as in  most cases the
party has very little choice in the matter.”

       “Yes,”  Hackworth said, “, see what you mean.”

       “The   commitment  is  a moral  one,  a  Tuestion of  honour,”  Finkle-
McGraw said. “That such an enJineer falls into trouble is evidence of mere
hypocrisy on  his  part.  We are  inclined  to  overlook  this sort  of  routine
caducity. ,f  he Joes  on to  behave treasonously, then that of  course is  a
different matter; but  if  he plays his role  well and provides  information of
value to Her  MaMesty's -oint Forces, then he has rather deftly parlayed a
small error into  a Jrand  act of  heroism. You may  be aware that it  is not
unusual for  heroes to  receive  kniJhthoods,  amonJ other  more  tanJible
rewards.”

       For  a few  moments,  Hackworth  was too  startled to  speak. He had
expected exile and perhaps deserved it. Mere forJiveness was more than he
could have hoped for. But Finkle-McGraw was JivinJ  him  the opportunity
for  somethinJ much  Jreater:  a chance  to  enter the  lower  ranks of   the
nobility. An eTuity stake in the tribal enterprise. There was only one answer
he could make, and he blurted it out before he had time to lose his nerve.

       “,   thank  you  for   your  forbearance,”  he said,  “and  ,   accept your
commission. Please consider me to be at Her  MaMesty's service from this
moment forward.”

       “Waiter!   BrinJ  some  champaJne, please,” MaMor Napier called.  “,
believe we have somethinJ to celebrate.”

       That  niJht  there  was hell  to  pay.  Kevin,  the  boy  whom  Nell  had
defeated over tetherball, had  learned everythinJ  he knew  about beinJ  a

222
bully from  none other than Burt, because Burt had lived with Kevin's mom
for a while  and miJht even have been Kevin's dad, so Kevin went to  Burt
and told him  that he'd  been beaten up by Harv  and Nell  actinJ toJether.
That niJht, both Harv and Nell Jot the worst spankinJ of their lives. ,t went
on so lonJ that finally Mom  tried to step in and Jet Burt to calm down. But
Burt  slapped Mom  across the  face and  shoved her  down on  the  floor.
Finally, Harv  and Nell  ended up  in their  room  toJether. Burt was  in the
livinJ  room  havinJ  a few  beers and JettinJ  into  a Burly   Scudd ractive.
Mom had run out of the apartment, and they had no idea where she was.

       One of  Harv's eyes was swollen shut, and one hand was not workinJ.
Nell was terribly  thirsty, and when she went to  pee, it came out red. Also
she had burns on her arms  from Burt's  ciJarettes, and the pain  Must kept
JettinJ worse.

       They could  sense Burt's movements throuJh the wall, and they could
hear the Burly Scudd ractive. Harv could tell  when Burt had Jone to sleep
because a sinJle-user ractive eventually went into pause mode if  the user
stopped ractinJ. When they were sure Burt was sleepinJ, they stole into the
kitchen to Jet some medicine from the M.C.

       Harv  Jot a bandaJe for his  wrist and a cold-pack for  his eye, and he
asked the M.C.   for  somethinJ  to  put  on  their  cuts and  burns  so they
wouldn't Jet  infected. The M.C.  displayed a whole  menu of mediaJlyphs
for different  kinds of remedies. Some of them were premiums, which  you
had to pay money for,  and there were a few freebies. One of  the freebies
was a cream that came in a tube, like toothpaste. They took it back to their
room and took turns spreadinJ it on each other's cuts and burns.

       Nell  lay Tuietly in bed until  she could tell that Harv had Jone to sleep.

WKen Baron  -ack  came  back  to tKe castOe tKe IoOOowLnJ day, Ke was

beOOowLnJ tKat Ke wouOd kLOO Harv and PrLncess NeOO KLmseOI; but

223
enterLnJ Lnto tKe dLnLnJ room, Ke stoSSed Ln wonderment  as  Ke saw

were Harv  and PrLncess NeOO, dressed Ln servants' unLIorms.

       “WeOcome to  your  castOe, Baron  -ack,”   PrLncess NeOO saLd. “As

       Baron  -ack's   anJer   subsLded as  KLs Jreedy  eyes  traveOed over

       “Princess Nell's pee-pee turned red too,” Nell said, “because the Baron
was a very bad man. And his real name wasn't Baron -ack. His  real name
was Burt.”

       As Nell  spoke the words, the story chanJed in the Primer.

       “And  Harv couldn't use his arm because of the wrist, so he had to carry
everythinJ with  one hand, and that's because Burt was a bad man and he
hurt it really bad,” Nell said.

       After  a lonJ  silence, the Primer beJan to speak aJain, but the lovely
voice of the Vicky  woman who told the story  sounded thick and hoarse all
of a sudden and would stumble in the middle of sentences.

        Miranda,   sittinJ   in  her  staJe  at  the  Parnasse, felt   an overwhelminJ
sense of relief  as her  next  line  appeared on  the prompter.  She took  a  deep
breath before she delivered  it,  closed her  eyes, settled her mind,  tried  to put
herself there  in  the Dark  Castle.  She looked  deep into  Princess  Nell's  eyes
and sold the line  with  every scrap of  talent and techniTue she had.

Good!”   saLd DLnosaur.  “TKen   tKe tLme  Kas come   Ior  you   and  Harv  to
IOee Irom tKe  Dark  CastOe!  You  must  be  as  steaOtKy as  you  can.   I wLOO
come  out  Oater and MoLn you.”

         

227
       Please get out of  there. Please run away. Get out of that  chamber of
horrors where you've been living, Nell, and get to an orphanage or a police
station or something, and I will find  you. No matter where you are, I'll find
you.

       Miranda   had it   worked  out  already:  she  could  compile  an  extra
mattress, put Nell on the floor of her bedroom and Harv in the livinJ  room
of her flat. ,f only she could fiJure out who the hell they were.

       Princess Nell   hadn't  responded. She was  thinkinJ,  which   was the
wronJ thinJ to do riJht now. Get out. Get out.

       “Why  are you puttinJ that stick in the fire?”

       “,t   is my  duty to  see that the evil  Baron never  troubles you aJain,”
Miranda said, readinJ from the prompter.

       “But  what are you JoinJ to do with that stick?”

       Please don't  do this.  It's  not the  time to  ask why. “You   must make
haste!” Miranda read, tryinJ  once aJain to  sell the line  as best she could.
But Princess Nell had been playinJ  with  the Primer for  a couple of  years
now and had Jotten in the habit of askinJ endless Tuestions.

       “Why  are you makinJ the stick sharper?”

       “This  is how Odysseus and , took care of the Cyclops,” Dinosaur said.
Shit. It's going all wrong.

       “What's Cyclops?” Nell  said.

       A  new  illustration  Jrew  on the  next paJe, facinJ  the  illustration  of
Dinosaur by  the fire.  ,t  was a picture  of  a one-eyed Jiant  herdinJ some
sheep.

       Dinosaur  told the  story of  how  Odysseus killed  the Cyclops with  a
pointed stick, Must as he was about to do to Baron  Burt. Nell  insisted  on

228
hearinJ what happened after that. One story led to another. Miranda tried to
tell the  stories as fast  as she could, tried  to  put a  tone of  boredom and
impatience into her voice, which  wasn't easy because she was actually on
the verJe of panic.  She had to Jet Nell  out of  that apartment before Burt
woke up from his drunk.

TKe eastern  sky was  beJLnnLnJ to JOow …

         

       Shit. Get out of there, Nell!

         

Dinosaur was Must in the middle of tellinJ Princess Nell about a witch who
turned men into swine when suddenly, poof, he turned back into  a stuffed
animal. The sun had come up.

       Nell  was a bit startled by this turn of events, and closed the Primer for
a while, and sat in the dark listeninJ to Harv  whee]e and Burt snore in the
next room.  She'd been  lookinJ  forward  to  the  moment when  Dinosaur
would kill  Baron Burt, Must as Odysseus had done to the Cyclops. But now
it wasn't  JoinJ  to happen. Baron Burt  would  wake up,  reali]e  he'd been
tricked, and hurt them worse. They'd be stuck in the Dark Castle forever.

       Nell  was tired of beinJ in the Dark Castle. She knew it was time to Jet
out.

       She opened the Primer.

       “Princess Nell  knew what she had to do,”  Nell  said. Then she closed
the Primer and left it on her pillow.

       Even if  she hadn't learned how to read pretty well, she would have had
no trouble findinJ what she wanted Must by usinJ the M.C.'s mediaJlyphics.
,t was a thinJ  she'd seen people use in the old passives, a thinJ she'd seen
when Mom's old  boyfriend  Brad had taken her to  visit  the horse barn in

229
Dovetail. ,t  was called a screwdriver, and you  could have the M.C.  make
them in all different shapes: lonJ, short, fat, skinny.

       She had it make one that was very lonJ and very skinny. When it was
finished, it made the hissinJ sound that it always made, and she thouJht she
heard Burt stirrinJ on the sofa.

       She peeked into  the livinJ   room.  He was  still  lyinJ  there, his  eyes
closed, but his arms were movinJ around. His head turned from side to side
once, and she could see a Jlimmer between his half-opened eyelids.

       He was about to wake up and hurt her some more.

       She  held the  screwdriver  out in   front  of  her  like  a lance  and ran
straiJht toward him.

       At  the last instant she faltered. The tool went astray and skidded across
his forehead, leavinJ a trail  of  red stitches. Nell was so horrified  that she
dropped it and Mumped back. Burt was shakinJ his head violently back and
forth.

       He opened his eyes and looked riJht at Nell.  Then he put his hand to
his forehead and brouJht  it  back all  bloody. He  sat up  on the sofa,  still
uncomprehendinJ. The screwdriver rolled off and bounced on the floor. He
picked it up and found the tip bloody, then fixed his eyes on Nell, who had
shrunk into the corner of the room.

       Nell  knew that she had done the wronJ thinJ. Dinosaur had told her to
run away, and she had pestered him with Tuestions instead.

       “Harv!”   she said. But her voice  came out all dry  and sTueaky, like a
mouse's. “We must fly!”

       “Yeah, you're Jonna fly  all  riJht,”  Burt  said swinJinJ his  feet around
to the floor. “RiJht out the fuckinJ window  you're Jonna fly.”

230
       Harv  came out. He was carryinJ  his nunchuks under his inMured arm
and the Primer in his Jood hand. The book hunJ open to an illustration  of
Princess Nell and Harv runninJ away from the Dark Castle with Baron Burt
in pursuit. “Nell,  your  book talked to me,”  he said. “,t  said we should run
away.” Then he saw Burt risinJ from  the sofa with the bloody  screwdriver
in his hand.

       Harv  didn't bother with  the nunchuks. He bolted across the room and
dropped the Primer, freeinJ his Jood hand to flinJ the front door open. Nell,
who had been fro]en in a nearby corner for some time, shot toward the door
like a bolt  finally  loosed from a crossbow, snatchinJ up the Primer as she
ran past it. They ran into the hallway with Burt only a few paces behind.

       The lobby  with the elevators was some distance away from them. On
impulse, Nell stopped and dropped to a crouch in Burt's path. Harv turned
toward her, terrified. “Nell!”  he cried.

       Burt's  pumpinJ  leJs  struck Nell   in  the side.  He spun  forward  and
landed hard on the hallway floor, skiddinJ for a short distance. This brouJht
him to  the  feet of  Harv,  who  had turned to  face  him  and deployed his
nunchuks. Harv went upside Burt's head a few times, but he was panicked
and didn't do a very Jood Mob of it. Burt Jroped with one hand and manaJed
to catch the chain that Moined the halves of the weapon. Nell had Jotten to
her feet by this point and ran up Burt's back; she lunJed forward  and sank
her teeth into the fleshy base of Burt's thumb. SomethinJ fast and confusinJ
happened, Nell was rollinJ on the floor, Harv was draJJinJ her back to her
feet, she reached back to  snatch up  the Primer,  which she  had dropped
aJain. They made it into the emerJency stairs and beJan to skitter down the
tunnel of urine, Jraffiti,  and refuse, MumpinJ over the odd slumberinJ body.
Burt entered the stairwell  in  pursuit, a couple of  fliJhts  behind  them. He
tried to make a  shortcut by vaultinJ  over the banister as he had seen and
done in ractives, but his drunk body didn't do it as well as a media hero, and
he tumbled down one fliJht,   cursinJ and screaminJ, now  rabid with  pain
and anJer. Nell and Harv kept runninJ.

231
       Burt's  pratfall  Jave them enouJh of  a lead to  make it  to the Jround
floor. They ran straiJht across the lobby and into the street. ,t was the wee
hours of the  morninJ, and  there was almost no one  out here, which  was
sliJhtly  unusual; normally there would have been decoys and lookouts for
druJ sellers. But toniJht  there was only one person on the whole block:  a
bulky  Chinese man with   a short  beard and close-cropped hair,  wearinJ
traditional  indiJo  paMamas and a black leather skullcap, standinJ  in  the
middle of the street with  his hands stuck in his sleeves. He Jave Nell  and
Harv  an appraisinJ  look  as they  ran past.  Nell  did  not  pay  him  much
attention. She Must ran as fast as she could.

       “Nell!”   Harv was sayinJ. “Nell!  Look!”

       She was afraid to look. She kept runninJ.

       “Nell,  stop and look!” Harv cried. He sounded exultant.

       Finally  Nell  ran around the corner of a buildinJ,  stopped, turned, and
peeked back cautiously.

       She was lookinJ  down  the empty street past the buildinJ   where she
had lived  her whole  life.  At  the end of  the street was  a biJ  mediatronic
advertisinJ display currently runninJ a biJ Coca-Cola ad, in the ancient and
traditional red used by that company.

       Silhouetted aJainst it  were two  men: Burt  and the biJ  round-headed
Chinese man.

       They were dancinJ toJether.

       No,  the Chinese man was  dancinJ. Burt  was Must staJJerinJ around
like a drunk.

       No, the Chinese man was not dancinJ, but doinJ some of the exercises
that DoMo had tauJht Nell about. He moved slowly and beautifully  except
for some moments when  every muscle  in  his body  would  Moin into one
explosive movement. 8sually these explosions were directed toward Burt.

232
       Burt fell  down, then struJJled up to his knees.

       The Chinese man Jathered himself toJether into a black seed, rose into
the air, spun around, and unfolded like a bloominJ  flower. One of his  feet
struck Burt on  the point of  his chin  and seemed to accelerate all the way
throuJh Burt's  head. Burt's  body  fell   back to  the  pavement like  a  few
Jallons of  water sloshed out of  a bucket. The  Chinese man became very
still,  settled his breathinJ, adMusted his skullcap and the sash on his robe.
Then he turned  his  back to  Nell  and Harv  and  walked away  down  the
middle of the street.

       Nell  opened her Primer. ,t was showinJ a picture of Dinosaur, seen in
silhouette throuJh a window in the Dark Castle, standinJ over the corpse of
Baron Burt with a smokinJ stake in his claws.

       Nell  said, “The  little  boy and the little  Jirl  were runninJ  away to the
Land Beyond.”


                 Hackworth  departs from Shanghai; his speculations
                               as to the possible motives of Dr. X. 



Would-be passenJers skidded to a halt on the saliva-slickened floor of the
ShanJhai Aerodrome  as the  announcer brayed the  names of  Jreat  and
ancient Chinese cities into his  microphone. They set baJs down,  shushed
children, furrowed  brows, cupped hands around  ears, and pursed lips  in
utter bewilderment.  None of  this  was made  any easier by  the  extended
family of  some two do]en  Must-arrived Boers, women in bonnets and boys
in heavy coarse farmer's pants, who had convened by one of the Jates and
beJun to sinJ a hymn of thanksJivinJ in thick hoarse voices.

       When  the announcer called out  Hackworth's fliJht   (San DieJo  with
stops in Seoul, Vladivostok, MaJadan, AnchoraJe, -uneau, Prince Rupert,
Vancouver, Seattle,  Portland,  San  Francisco,  Santa Barbara,  and  Los
AnJeles), he apparently decided that it was beneath his diJnity,  above his
abilities, or both  to speak Korean, Russian, EnJlish, French, Coast Salish,

233
and Spanish  in  the  same  sentence, and so  he  Must hummed into   the
microphone for a while  as if,  far from  beinJ a professional announcer, he
were a shy, indifferent vocalist hidden within in a vast choir.

       Hackworth   knew  perfectly  well   that  hours  would  pass before  he
actually  found  himself   on  an  airship,   and  that  havinJ   achieved that
milestone, he  miJht  have  to  wait  hours  more  for  its  actual  departure.
Nonetheless, he had to say Jood-bye to his family at some point,  and this
seemed no worse a time than any other. HoldinJ  Fiona  (so biJ  and solid
now!) in  the crook of  one arm, and holdinJ  hands with Gwen,  he pushed
insistently   across  a   riptide   of   travelers,   beJJars,  pickpockets,   and
entrepreneurs tradinJ  in   everythinJ  from   bolts  of   real  silk   to   stolen
intellectual property. Finally  they  reached a corner where a lanJuid  eddy
had separated itself from the flow of people, and where Fiona could safely
be set down.

       He turned first  to Gwen. She still looked as stunned and vacant as she
had, more or less consistently, since he told her that he had received a new
assiJnment “whose nature , am not at liberty to disclose, save to say that it
concerns the future, not merely of my department, nor of -ohn =aibatsu, but
of that phyle into which you had the Jood fortune to have been born and to
which ,  have sworn undyinJ  loyalty,”  and that  he was makinJ  a trip  “of
indefinite duration” to North  America. ,t had been increasinJly clear of late
that Gwen simply  didn't Jet  it.  At  first, Hackworth  had been annoyed by
this,  viewinJ    it   as  a   symptom  of   hitherto   unevidenced  intellectual
shortcominJs. More recently, he had come to understand that it had more to
do with  emotional stance. Hackworth was  embarkinJ on  a Tuest of sorts
here, real Boy's Own Paper stuff, hiJhly romantic. Gwen hadn't been raised
on the proper diet of specious adventure yarns and simply found the whole
concept unfathomable. She did a bit of rote snifflinJ  and tear-wipinJ, Jave
him a Tuick kiss and a huJ, and stepped back, havinJ completed her role in
the ceremony with nothinJ close to enouJh histrionics. Hackworth, feelinJ
somewhat disJruntled, sTuatted down to face Fiona.

       His  dauJhter seemed to have a better intuitive Jrasp of  the situation;
she had been up several times a niJht recently, complaininJ of bad dreams,

234
and on the way to the Aerodrome she had been perfectly Tuiet. She stared at
her father with larJe red eyes. Tears came to Hackworth's eyes, and his nose
beJan to run. He blew his  nose planJently, held the handkerchief over his
face for a moment, and composed himself.

       Then he reached into the breast pocket of his overcoat and drew out a
flat  packaJe, wrapped  up  in   mediatronic  paper  of  sprinJ   wildflowers
bendinJ  in   a   Jentle  bree]e.   Fiona   briJhtened  up   immediately,  and
Hackworth could not help chucklinJ,  not for the first  time, at the charminJ
susceptibility of  small  people to frank  bribery.  “You  will  forJive  me  for
ruininJ the surprise,” he said, “by tellinJ you that this is a book, my darlinJ.
A maJic book. , made it for  you, because , love you and could not think of
a better way  to express that love.  And  whenever you open its  paJes, no
matter how far away , miJht be, you will find me here.”

       “Thank  you ever so much, Father,” she said, takinJ it with both hands,
and he could  not  help himself  from  sweepinJ  her up  in  both arms  and
JivinJ her a Jreat huJ and a kiss. “Good-bye, my best beloved, you will see
me in your dreams,” he whispered into her tiny, flawless ear, and then he set
her free, spun around, and walked away before she could see the tears that
had beJun to run down his face.

       Hackworth  was a free man now, wanderinJ throuJh the Aerodrome in
an emotional stupor, and only reached his fliJht by participatinJ in the same
flock  instinct that  all  the natives used to  reach theirs. Whenever he  saw
more than one gwailo headinJ  purposefully in  one direction, he  followed
them, and then others started followinJ him, and thus did a mob of foreiJn
devils coalesce amonJ a hundred times as many natives, and finally,  two
hours after their  fliJht   was supposed to  leave, they  mobbed a Jate  and
climbed aboard the  airship HanMin Takhoma—which miJht or  miJht  not
have been their assiJned vessel, but the passenJers now had a sufficient
numerical maMority to hiMack it to America, which was the only thinJ  that
really counted in China.

       He had received a summons from the Celestial KinJdom. Now he was
on his way to the territory  still  known  vaJuely as America. His eyes were

235
red from cryinJ  over  Gwen and Fiona, and his blood  was swarminJ with
nanosites whose functions were known only to Dr. ;;   Hackworth  had lain
back, closed his eyes, rolled up  his sleeve, and hummed “Rule,  Atlantis”
while Dr. ;'s   physicians (at least he hoped they were physicians) shoved a
fat needle into his arm. The needle was fed by a tube that ran directly into a
special fittinJ on the matter compiler; Hackworth was pluJJed directly  into
the Feed, not the reJulation Atlantan kind but Dr. ;'s  black-market kludJe.
He could only hope that they'd Jiven it the riJht instructions, as it would be
a shame to have a washinJ machine, a mediatronic chopstick, or a kilo of
China White materiali]e  in  his arm. Since then, he'd had a few  attacks of
the shivers, suJJestinJ that his immune system was reactinJ to somethinJ
Dr. ;   had put in there. His body would either Jet  used to it or (preferably)
destroy the offendinJ nanosites.

       The airship was a dromond, the larJest class of noncarJo vessel. ,t was
divided into four  classes. Hackworth was second from the bottom, in third.
Below that was steeraJe, which was for miJratinJ thetes, and for sky-Jirls,
prostitutes of  the  air. Even  now, these were  bribinJ  their  way  past  the
conductors and into the third-class lounJe, makinJ eyes at Hackworth and
at  the  white-shirted  sararimen  who  tended  to  travel   this  way.  Those
Jentlemen had Jrown  up in  one crowded DraJon  or another, where they
knew how  to  Jenerate a sort  of  artificial   privacy  field  by  determinedly
iJnorinJ  each other. Hackworth had arrived at the point  where he frankly
didn't care, and so he stared directly at these men, front-line soldiers of their
various microstates, as each one primly folded his navy blue suit Macket and
elbow-crawled into a coffinlike  microcabin like a G, sTuirminJ under a roll
of concertina wire, accompanied or not by a camp follower.

       Hackworth  pointlessly wondered whether he was the only one of this
ship's some two  thousand passenJers who believed  that prostitution  (or
anything) was immoral. He did not consider this Tuestion in a self-riJhteous
way, more out of rueful curiosity; some of the sky-Jirls were Tuite fetchinJ.
But as he draJJed his body into his microberth, he suffered another attack
of the  shivers, remindinJ him  that  even if  his soul  had been willinJ,  his
flesh was simply too weak.

236
       Another  possible explanation for the chills was that Dr.  ;'s   nanosites
were seekinJ out and destroyinJ the ones that H.M. -oint Forces had put in
there, waJinJ a turf war inside his body, and his immune system was doinJ
overtime tryinJ to pick  up the carnaJe. Hackworth unexpectedly fell asleep
before the dromond had even pulled away from her moorinJ mast, and had
dreams about the murderous implements he had seen maJnified on Dr. ;'s
mediatron durinJ   his  first   visit.  ,n   the  abstract they  were  friJhteninJ
enouJh. HavinJ a few million   of them in  his veins didn't  do much for  his
peace of mind. ,n the end it wasn't as bad as knowinJ your blood was full of
spirochetes, which people used to live with  for  decades. Ama]inJ  what a
person could Jet used to.

       When he settled into  bed, he heard a small chime, like  faery bells. ,t
was cominJ from the little pen danJlinJ from  his watch chain, and it meant
that he had mail. Perhaps a thank-you note from  Fiona. He couldn't sleep
anyway, and so he took  out  a sheet of  mediatronic paper and spoke the
commands that transferred the mail from the pen charm onto the paJe.

       He was disappointed to note that it was printed, not handwritten; some
kind of  official  correspondence, and not, unfortunately, a note from Fiona.
When he beJan  to read  it,  he understood that it  wasn't  even official.   ,t
wasn't even  from   a  human.  ,t   was  a  notification   sent  back   to  him
automatically by a piece of machinery he had set into motion two years aJo.
The central messaJe was wreathed in paJes of technical Jibberish, maps,
Jraphs, and diaJrams. The messaJe was:

 

                   THE YO8NG  LADY'S  ILL8STRATED   PRIMER
                                         HAS BEEN  FO8ND. 

 

       ,t  was accompanied by an animated, three-dimensional map of  New
Chusan with a red line drawn across it, startinJ  in front  of a rather seedy-

237
lookinJ   hiJh-rise   apartment  buildinJ   in   the   Leased  Territory   called
Enchantment and makinJ its way erratically around the island from there.

       Hackworth lauJhed until his neiJhbors pounded on the adMoininJ walls
and asked him to shut up.


                    Nell and Harv  at large in the Leased Territories;
                      encounter with an inhospitable security pod; a 
                                    revelation about the Primer. 



The Leased Territories were too valuable to leave much room  for Nature,
but the Jeotects of  ,mperial  Tectonics Limited  had heard that trees were
useful for cleaninJ and coolinJ  the air, and so they had built  in Jreenbelts
alonJ the borders between sectors. ,n the first hour that  they lived  free in
the streets, Nell Jlimpsed one of those Jreenbelts, thouJh it looked black at
the time. She broke away from  Harv and ran toward  it down  a street that
had developed into a  luminescent tunnel of  mediatronic billboards.  Harv
chased her, Must barely matchinJ her speed because he had Jotten a worse
spankinJ than she had. They  were almost  the only  people on  the street,
certainly  the only   ones movinJ   purposefully,  and so,  as they  ran,  the
messaJes on the billboards pursued them like starvinJ wolves, makinJ sure
they understood that if they used certain ractives or took certain druJs, they
could rely  on  beinJ able  to have  sex with  certain unrealistically  perfect
younJ persons. Some of the billboards made an even more elemental pitch,
sellinJ the  sex directly. The  mediatrons on this  street were exceptionally
larJe because they were made to be seen clearly from  the  heaths, bluffs,
terraces, and courts of the New Atlantis Clave, miles up the mountain.

       8nremittinJ  exposure to this kind of thinJ produced mediatron burnout
amonJ the tarJet audience. ,nstead of turninJ them off and JivinJ people a
break for once, the proprietors had Moined in an arms race of sorts, tryinJ to
find the maJic  imaJe that would  make people iJnore all the  other adverts
and fix raptly on theirs. The obvious step of makinJ their mediatrons biJJer
than the others had been taken about as far as it could Jo. 4uite some time
aJo the content issue had been settled: tits, tires, and explosions were the

238
only thinJs that  seemed to draw the notice of their  supremely Maded focus
Jroups, thouJh from  time  to time  they would  play the  Muxtaposition card
and throw in somethinJ inconJruous, like a nature scene or a man in a black
turtleneck readinJ poetry. Once all the mediatrons were a hundred feet hiJh
and filled with  tits,  the only  competitive strateJy that  hadn't already been
pushed to the redline was technical tricks:  painfully  briJht  flashes, Mump-
cuts, and simulated 3-D phantoms that made bluff charJes toward specific
viewers who didn't seem to be payinJ enouJh attention.

       ,t  was down  a mile-lonJ  Jallery  of  these stimuli that Nell  made her
unexpected breakaway, lookinJ from  Harv's increasinJly  distant  point of
view like  an ant scuttlinJ  across a television screen with the intensity and
saturation turned all  the way  up, violently  chanJinJ  course from time  to
time as she was menaced by a virtual pitch-daemon lunJinJ at her from the
false parallax of  a movinJ  ]-buffer,   flarinJ  like  a comet aJainst a  boJus
firmament of video black. She knew that they were fake and in most cases
didn't even  recoJni]e  the  products they  were pitchinJ,  but  her  life  had
tauJht her everythinJ about dodJinJ. She couldn't not dodJe.

       They hadn't fiJured  out a way to make the adverts come at you head-
on, and so she maintained a rouJhly consistent direction down the middle of
the street  until  she  vaulted an  enerJy-absorbinJ barrier  at  its  end  and
vanished into the forest. Harv followed her a few  seconds later, thouJh his
arm didn't support vaultinJ and so he ended up hurtlinJ iJnominiously over
the top, like a hyped autoskater who hadn't seen the barrier at all, Must body-
kissed it full  tilt.  “Nell!”   he was already hollerinJ,  as he came to rest in a
nest of colorful discarded packaJinJ materials. “You can't stay in here! You
can't stay in the trees, Nell!”

       Nell  had already worked her way  deep into the woods, or as deep as
you could Jet in a narrow Jreenbelt made to separate one Leased Territory
from another. She fell down a couple of times and banJed her head on a tree
until, with   childish adaptivity,  she reali]ed  that she was  on one of  those
surfaces that wasn't flat like a floor,  street, or sidewalk. The ankles would
actually have to show some versatility here. ,t was like one of those places
she had read about  in  the ,llustrated  Primer, a  maJical  ]one  where the

239
fractal dimension of  the terrain  had been allowed to  struJJle off  the pin,
bumps supportinJ smaller copies of  themselves, repeat until microscopic,
throw dirt  over  it, and plant  some of  those creepy new DouJlas firs  that
Jrow as fast as bamboo. Nell soon encountered a biJ DouJ that had blown
down in a recent typhoon, poppinJ its  own rootball  out of  the Jround and
thereby excavatinJ a handy depression that invited nestlinJ. Nell Mumped in.

       For a few  minutes she found it stranJely hilarious that Harv could not
find her. Their  flat  had only  two hidinJ  places, both closets, and so their
traditional exploits  in  the hide-and-Jo-seek field  had provided them  with
minimal entertainment value and left them wonderinJ what the biJ deal was
anyway about that stupid Jame. But now, here in the dark woods, Nell was
beJinninJ to Jet it.

       “Do  you Jive up?” she finally  said, and then Harv found her. He stood
at the edJe of the rootball pit and demanded that she come out. She refused.
Finally  he clambered down, thouJh to  an eye more  critical  than Nell's it
miJht have looked as if he were fallinJ.  Nell Mumped into his lap before he
could Jet up. “We Jotta Jo,” he said.

       “,  want to stay here. ,t's nice,” Nell said.

       “You  ain't the  only one who  thinks so,”  Harv said. “That's  why they
Jot pods here.”

       “Pods?”

       “Aerostats. For security.”

       Nell  was deliJhted  to hear it  and could  not fathom  why  her brother
spoke of security with such dread in his voice.

       A  soprano turboMet seemed to bear down on them, fadinJ in and out as
it tacked throuJh the flora. The creepy afflatus Dopplered down a couple of
notes as it came to a stop directly above them. They couldn't see more than
the odd Jlint of colored liJht, picked up by whatever-it-was from the distant
mediatrons. A voice, flawlessly  reproduced and Must a hair too loud, came

240
out of it:  “Visitors  are welcome to stroll throuJh this  park at any time. We
hope you have enMoyed your stay. Please inTuire if you need directions, and
this unit will  assist you.”

       “,t's  nice,” Nell said.

       “Not  for lonJ,”  Harv said. “Let's Jet out of here before it Jets pissed.”

       “,  like it  here.”

       Bluish  liJht  exploded out of  the aerostat. They both hollered as their
irises convulsed. ,t  was hollerinJ  riJht  back at them:  “Allow   me to liJht
your way to the nearest exit!”

       “We're  runninJ   away from   home,”  Nell  explained.  But  Harv  was
scramblinJ up out of the hole, yankinJ Nell behind him with his Jood hand.

       The thinJ's turbines screeched briefly as it made a bluff charJe. ,n this
fashion it  herded them briskly  toward  the nearest street. When they  had
finally climbed over a barrier and Jotten their feet back on concreta firma, it
snapped off its liJht and ]oomed off without so much as a fare-thee-well.

       “,t's  okay, Nell, they always do that.”

       “Why?”

       “So this place don't fill  up with transients.”

       “What's that?”

       “That's what we are, now,” Harv explained.

       “Let's  Jo stay with  your buds!”  Nell  said. Harv had never introduced
Nell to  any of  his buds before, she knew them only  as children of earlier
epochs knew   GilJamesh,  Roland,  or   Superman.  She  was  under  the
impression that the streets of the Leased Territories were rife  with  Harv's
buds and that they were more or less all-powerful.

241
       Harv's  face sTuirmed for  a while,  and  then he said,  “We Jotta  talk
about your maJic book.”

       “The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer?”

       “Yeah, whatever it's called.”

       “Why  must we talk about it?”

       “Huh?”  Harv said in the dopey voice he affected whenever Nell talked
fancy.

       “Why  do we Jotta talk about it?” Nell said patiently.

       “There's somethinJ  , never told  you about  that book, but ,  Jotta  tell
you now,” Harv  said. “Come on, let's keep movinJ, or some creep's Jonna
come hassle us.” They headed toward the main street of La]y Bay Towne,
which was the Leased Territory into which  the pod had eMected them. The
main street curved alonJ  the waterfront,  separatinJ a beach from  a very
larJe  number   of   drinkinJ   establishments  fronted  with    lurid,   bawdy
mediatrons. “, don't want to Jo  that way,” Nell  said, rememberinJ that last
Jauntlet of electromaJnetic pimps. But Harv Jrabbed her wrist and hobbled
downhill, pullinJ  her behind. “,t's safer than beinJ in the back streets. Now
let me tell  you about that book. My  buds and , pinched it  and some other
stuff from a Vicky we rolled. Doc told us to roll him.”

       “Doc?”

       “This  Chinese Juy who  runs the Flea Circus. He said we  should roll
him, and make sure we made it Jood so it'd Jet picked up on the monitors.”

       “What  does that mean?”

       “Never  mind.  He also said he wanted us  to lift   somethinJ from  this
Vicky—a certain packaJe about yay biJ.” Harv formed riJht anJles with his
thumbs and index finJers and defined the vertices of a rectanJle, book-si]e.
“Gave us  to  understand it  was valuable.  Well,  we didn't  find   any such

242
packaJe. We did find a shitty  old  book on him,  thouJh. , mean, it  looked
old and fine, but no one reckoned it could be the thinJ Doc was lookinJ for,
since he's Jot lots of books. So , took it for you.

       “Well,  a week or two  later, Doc wants to know where is the packaJe,
and we told him this story. When he heard about that book, he flipped and
told us that the book and the packaJe were one and the same. By that time,
you were already playinJ  with that book  all niJht  and all  day, Nell, and ,
couldn't bear to take it away from you, so , lied. , told him , threw the book
down on the sidewalk when  , saw it  was Munk, and if it wasn't still  there,
then someone else must have come alonJ and picked it up. Doc was pissed,
but he fell for it.

       “That's  why ,  never brouJht my  buds to the flat.  ,f  anyone finds out
you still have that book, Doc'll kill me.”

       “What  should we do?”

       Harv  Jot  a look  on  his face  like  he'd rather not  talk  about it.  “For
starters, let's Jet some free stuff.”

       They took  a sneaky and indirect route to the waterfront, stayinJ as far
as possible from the clusters of drunks windinJ throuJh the constellation of
incandescent bordellos like cold  dark clumps  of  rock wendinJ  their  way
throuJh a briJht  nebula of  younJ stars. They made their  way to  a public
M.C. on a streetcorner and picked out items from the free menu: boxes of
water and nutri-broth, envelopes of sushi made from nanosurimi  and rice,
candy bars, and packaJes about the si]e  of  Harv's  hand, festooned with
implausible block  letter  promises (“REFLECTS  99% OF  ,NFRARED!”)
that folded out into huJe crinkly metalli]ed blankets. Nell had been noticinJ
a lot of rouJh  shapes strewn around on the beach like Jiant chrome-plated
larva. Must be fellow  transients wrapped up in these selfsame. As soon as
they had scored the Joodies, they  ran down to  the beach and picked out
their own  spot. Nell  wanted one closer to  the surf, but  Harv  made some
very  well-considered  observations about  the  inadvisability   of   sleepinJ
below hiJh  tide.  They  trudJed alonJ  the seawall  for  a Jood  mile  or  so

243
before findinJ a relatively abandoned bit of beach and wrapped themselves
up in their blankets there. Harv insisted that one of them had to stay awake
at all times to act as a sentry. Nell had learned all about this  kind of  thinJ
from her virtual adventures in the Primer, and so she volunteered to stay up
first. Harv went to sleep pretty soon, and Nell opened up her book. At times
like this, the paper Jlowed softly  and the letters stood out crisp and black,
like tree branches silhouetted aJainst a full moon.


                  Miranda's  reactions to the evening's events; solace
                   from an unexpected quarter; from  the Primer, the 
                 demise of a hero, flight to the Land Beyond, and the 
                                         lands of King Magpie. 



The Theatre Parnasse had a rather nice bar, nothinJ spectacular, Must a sort
of livinJ  room off  the main floor, with the bar itself  recessed into one wall.
The old furniture and pictures had been looted by the Red Guards and later
replaced with post-Mao stuff that was not as fine. The manaJement kept the
boo]e locked up when the ractors were workinJ,  not sharinJ any romantic
notions about substance-abusinJ creative Jeniuses. Miranda stumbled down
from her box, fixed herself a club soda, and settled into a plastic chair. She
put her shakinJ hands toJether like the covers of a book and then buried her
face in them. After  a few deep breaths she Jot tears to come, thouJh they
came silently, a temporary lettinJ-off-steam  cry, not the catharsis she was
hopinJ for. She hadn't earned the catharsis yet, she knew, because what had
happened was Must the first act. -ust the initial incident,  or whatever they
called it in the books.

       “RouJh  session?” said a voice. Miranda recoJni]ed it, but Must barely:
,t was  Carl Hollywood,   the dramaturJe, in effect  her boss. But  he didn't
sound like a Jruff son of a bitch toniJht, which was a switch.

       Carl  was in  his  forties, six  and a  half feet  tall,  massively built  and
Jiven to wearinJ lonJ  black coats that almost swept the floor. He had lonJ
wavy blond hair drawn back from  his forehead and affected a sort of KinJ
Tut beard. Either he was celibate, or else he believed that the particulars of

244
his sexual orientation and needs were infinitely  too complex  to be shared
with those he worked  with.  Everyone was scared shitless of him,  and he
liked it  that way;  he couldn't do his  Mob if he was buddies with all  of the
ractors.

       She  heard his  cowboy  boots  approachinJ across the  bare,  stained
Chinese ruJ. He confiscated her club soda. “Don't want to drink  this fi]]y
stuff  when  you're  havinJ   a  cry.  ,t'll   come  out  your   nose. You  need
somethinJ like   tomato Muice—replace those lost electrolytes.  ,  tell  you
what,” he said, rattlinJ his tremendous keychain, “,'ll break the rules and fix
you an honest-to-Jod Bloody Mary. 8sually , make 'em with tabasco, which
is how  we do  it  where ,'m  from.  But  since your  mucus membranes are
already irritated enouJh, ,'ll Must make a borinJ one.”

       By  the time he was finished with this oration,  Miranda had Jotten her
hands away from her face at least. She turned away from him.

       “Kind   of funny  ractinJ in  that little  box, ain't  it,”  Carl  said, “kind  of
isolatinJ. Theatre didn't used to be that way.”

       “,solatinJ?  Sort of,”  Miranda said. “,  could use a little  more isolation
toniJht.”

       “You  tellinJ me to leave you alone, or—”

       “No!”   Miranda  said, soundinJ desperate to herself. She brouJht  her
voice to heel before continuinJ. “No, that's not how ,  meant it. ,t's Must that
you never know what role you're JoinJ  to play. And some of the roles can
cut pretty deep. ,f someone handed me a script for what , Must did and asked
me if , were interested in the part, ,'d refuse it.”

       “Was it  a porn thinJ?”  Carl Hollywood   said. His voice sounded a bit
stranJled. He was anJry all of  a sudden. He had stopped in the middle of
the room, clenchinJ her Bloody Mary as if he miJht pop the Jlass in his fist.

       “No.  ,t  wasn't like that,” Miranda  said. “At  least, it wasn't porn in the
sense you're talkinJ about,”  Miranda said, “thouJh  you never  know what

245
turns people on.”

       “Was the payer lookinJ to Jet turned on?”

       “No.  Absolutely not,” Miranda said.

       Then, after a lonJ time, she said, “,t was a kid. A little Jirl.”

       Carl  Jave her  a searchinJ  look,  then remembered his manners and
Jlanced away, pretendinJ to appraise the carvinJ on the front of the bar.

       “So  the  next Tuestion is,”  Miranda  said after  she'd steadied herself
with  a few  Julps of  the drink,  “why  ,  should Jet  so upset over a  kiddie
ractive.”

       Carl shook his head. “, wasn't JoinJ to ask it.”

       “But  you're wonderinJ.”

       “What   ,'m   wonderinJ   about  is   my   problem,”   Carl  said.   “Let's
concentrate on your problems for now.” He frowned, sat down across from
her and ran his hand back throuJh his hair absentmindedly. “,s this that biJ
account?” He  had access to her  spreadsheets; he knew how  she'd been
spendinJ her time.

       “Yeah.”

       “,'ve  sat in on a few of those sessions.”

       “,  know you have.”

       “Seems different from  normal kiddie stuff. The education is there, but
it's darker. Lots of unreconstructed Grimm Brothers content. Powerful.”

       “Yeah.”

       “,t's  ama]inJ to me that one kid can spend that much time—”

246
       “Me  too.”  Miranda  took another swallow, then bit  off  the end of  the
celery stick  and chewed awhile,  stallinJ.  “What  it  comes down  to,”  she
said, “is that ,'m raisinJ someone's kid for them.”

       Carl  looked her straiJht in  the eye for the first  time in  a while. “And
some heavy shit Must went down,” he said.

       “Some very heavy shit, yes.”

       Carl nodded.

       “,t's  so  heavy,” Miranda  said, “that  , don't  even know  if  this Jirl   is
alive or dead.”

       Carl  Jlanced up at the fancy old  clock on  the wall, its  face yellowed
from a century and a half's accumulation of tar and nicotine. “,f she's alive,”
he said, “then she probably needs you.”

       “RiJht,”   Miranda  said. She stood up and  headed for the exit.  Then,
before Carl could react, she spun on the  ball of  her foot,  bent down, and
kissed him on the cheek.

       “Aw,  stop it,” he said.

       “See you later, Carl. Thanks.” She ran up the narrow staircase, headinJ
for her box.

PrLncess NeOO, “and I wLOO ILnd tKe tweOve keys, and I wLOO come back

       “I'm  not KoOdLnJ my breatK,” Harv saLd, “but tKanks anyway.”

       Down  on  tKe sKore  was  a  OLttOe boat tKat NeOO's IatKer Kad once
used to  row around  tKe LsOand. NeOO cOLmbed Ln wLtK Ker NLJKt FrLends

       NeOO rowed Ior many Kours untLO Ker back and sKouOders acKed.
TKe sun set  Ln tKe west, tKe sky  became  dark,  and Lt became  Karder
to make  out  tKe Raven  aJaLnst  tKe darkOLnJ sky. TKen, mucK to  Ker

       “TKen   I  sKaOO do my duty   as  a   warrLor,” DLnosaur  saLd.  “My

       “We  must   not  dawdOe Kere,” PurSOe saLd, “Oest we be seen   by

       “Too Oate!” crLed sKarS-eyed Peter. “We are dLscovered!”

       At  tKat moment,  tKe sun rose,  and tKe  NLJKt FrLends turned back
Lnto stuIIed anLmaOs.

       A  soOLtary bLrd was dLvLnJ toward tKem out  oI  tKe mornLnJ  sky.
WKen Lt drew  cOoser, PrLncess NeOO saw tKat Lt was not one oI  KLnJ

       “WLtK tKe Jood news,”  PrLncess NeOO saLd.

       SKe  SOunJed Lnto tKe Iorest and,  beIore  OonJ, Iound  a dLrt road

AIter  a  break   Ior  OuncK sKe started   down   tKLs road,  keeSLnJ  one

       There followed  a  funny little   chapter in which  Nell  encountered the
footprints of another traveler on the road, who was soon Moined by another
traveler, and another. This continued until niJhtfall, when Purple examined
the footprints  and informed  Princess Nell  that  she had been walkinJ   in
circles all day.

“But  I Kave IoOOowed tKe road careIuOOy,” NeOO saLd.

       “TKe  road  Ls one  oI  KLnJ MaJSLe's trLcks,” PurSOe saLd. “It Ls a

       “But  Kow  can  we ILnd KLs castOe LI aOO oI tKe roads are made to

       “NeOO, do you Kave your sewLnJ-needOe?” PurSOe saLd.

       “Yes,”   saLd NeOO, reacKLnJ Lnto Ker Socket and   takLnJ out   Ker

       “Peter,  do you  Kave your maJLc stone?”  PurSOe contLnued.

       “Yes,”   Peter  saLd,  takLnJ Lt out   oI  KLs Socket.  It   dLd not  Oook

       “Very  weOO. I wLOO aOso need a bowO oI water,” PurSOe saLd, and
coOOected tKe tKree Ltems Irom Ker tKree IrLends.

 

       Nell   read on  into  the  Primer,  learninJ  about  how  Purple  made a
compass by maJneti]inJ   the  needle, thrustinJ  it   throuJh  the cork,  and
floatinJ  it  in  the bowl  of  water.  She read about their  three-day Mourney
throuJh the land of KinJ MaJpie, and of all the tricks it contained—animals
that  stole   their   food,   Tuicksand,  sudden  rainstorms,   appeti]inJ   but
poisonous berries, snares, and pitfalls set to  catch uninvited  Juests. Nell
knew that if  she wanted, she could Jo back and ask Tuestions about these
thinJs later and spend many hours readinJ about this part of the adventure.
But the important part  seemed to be the discussions with Peter that ended
each day's Mourney.

Peter  RabbLt was   tKeLr JuLde tKrouJK  aOO oI tKese SerLOs. HLs eyes

                                                   stranger. 



TKe cLty oI KLnJ MaJSLe was  more  IrLJKtenLnJ to PrLncess NeOO tKan

Kyena wLtK red eyes  and  drLSSLnJ IanJs came  and  cKased  tKem  aOO

       “PerKaSs  we  can  sneak  back   Lnto tKe JOade aIter  Lt Jets  dark,
wKen tKe Kyena wLOO not see us,” NeOO suJJested.

       “TKe  Kyena wLOO aOways see us, even Ln tKe dark, because Lt can
see tKe LnIrared OLJKt tKat comes out oI our bodLes,” PurSOe saLd.

       EventuaOOy, NeOO, Peter, Duck, and PurSOe Iound a SOace to camS

and OLt a ILre, and tKey Kad some souS beIore JoLnJ to bed. But  try as

253
       “WKy  are  you OookLnJ Lnto tKe darkness and  not  Lnto tKe ILre as

       “Because   tKe  darkness    Ls wKere  danJer   comes   Irom,”   Peter
saLd, “and Irom tKe ILre comes onOy LOOusLon. WKen I was a OLttOe bunny
runnLnJ away Irom  Kome, tKat Ls one oI tKe ILrst Oessons I Oearned.”

         

       Peter went on to tell  his own story, Must as Dinosaur had earlier in the
Primer. ,t was  a story about how  he and his brothers had run  away from
home and fallen afoul of various cats, vultures, weasels, doJs, and humans
who tended to see them, not as intrepid little adventurers but as lunch. Peter
was the only one of them who had survived, because he was the cleverest of
them all.

I made  uS my mLnd tKat one  day I wouOd avenJe  my brotKers,”  Peter
saLd.

       “DLd you?”

       “WeOO, tKat's a OonJ story Ln LtseOI.”

       “TeOO Lt to me!” PrLncess NeOO saLd.

       But  beIore  Peter couOd OauncK Lnto tKe next Sart oI KLs story, tKey
became aware  oI  a stranJer  wKo was  aSSroacKLnJ tKem. “We sKouOd
wake uS Duck  and PurSOe,” Peter saLd.

       “OK,  Oet tKem sOeeS,” PrLncess NeOO saLd. “TKey can use tKe rest,
and tKLs stranJer doesn't  Oook so bad.”

       “WKat  does a bad  stranJer  Oook OLke exactOy?” Peter saLd.

       “You know,  OLke a weaseO or a vuOture,” PrLncess NeOO saLd.

254
       “HeOOo, younJ  Oady,” saLd tKe  stranJer,   wKo   was   dressed   Ln
exSensLve cOotKes and MeweOry. “I couOdn't KeOS notLcLnJ tKat you are

       “I won't  Oeave my IrLends beKLnd,” saLd PrLncess NeOO.

       “OI   course   not—I  wasn't   suJJestLnJ   that,”   tKe  stranJer   saLd.
“Too bad   tKey're  asOeeS. Say, I  Kave  an  Ldea! You  come  wLtK me,
your rabbLt IrLend stays awake  Kere  to keeS  an eye  on your  sOeeSLnJ

You're not a  OLttOe baby, are you?”

       “No,  I don't  tKLnk so,” PrLncess NeOO saLd.

       “TKen  come  wLtK me, JLve me a IaLr KearLnJ, cKeck me out,  and
LI I turn out to be an  okay Juy,  we'OO come back and SLck uS tKe rest oI
your OLttOe JrouS. Come on, tLme's a wastLnJ!”

       PrLncess NeOO Iound Lt very Kard to say no to tKe stranJer.  “Don't
Jo  wLtK KLm, NeOO!” Peter saLd. But Ln tKe end,  NeOO went wLtK KLm
anyway.  In  Ker  Keart  sKe   knew  Lt was   wronJ,   but  Ker  Kead  was
IooOLsK, and because sKe was stLOO Must a OLttOe JLrO, sKe dLd not IeeO sKe
couOd say no to a Jrown-uS man.

         

       At  this point the story became very ractive. Nell stayed up for a while
in the ractive, tryinJ  different thinJs. Sometimes the man Jave her a drink,
and she fell asleep. But if she refused to take the drink, he would Jrab her
and tie her up. Either way, the man always turned out to be a pirate, or else
he would sell Princess Nell to some other pirates who would keep her and

255
not let her  Jo. Nell  tried  every trick  she could think  of, but  it  seemed as
thouJh the  ractive were  made in  such a way  that,  once she'd made the
decision to Jo away with the stranJer, nothinJ she could do would prevent
her from becominJ a slave to the pirates.

       After  the tenth or twelfth  iteration she dropped the book into the sand
and hunched over it, cryinJ.  She cried silently so Harv  wouldn't wake up.
She cried for a lonJ time, seeinJ no reason to stop, because she felt that she
was trapped now, Must like Princess Nell in the book.

       “Hey,”   said a  man's voice,  very  soft.  At  first   Nell  thouJht  it  was
cominJ out of  the Primer, and she iJnored it because she was anJry at the
Primer.

       “What's wronJ,  little Jirl?”  said the voice. Nell tried  to look up toward
the source, but all she saw was fat colored liJht from the mediatrons filtered
throuJh tears. She rubbed her eyes, but her hands had sand on them. She Jot
panicky  for  a  moment,  because she had  reali]ed   there was  definitely
someone there, a Jrown-up man, and she felt blind and helpless.

       Finally  she Jot  a look  at him. He  was sTuattinJ about six feet  away
from  her,  a safe  enouJh  distance, watchinJ  her  with   his  forehead all
wrinkled up, lookinJ terribly  concerned.

       “There's no reason to be cryinJ,” he said. “,t can't be that bad.”

       “Who  are you?” Nell said.

       “,'m  Must a friend who wants to help you. C'mon,” he said, cockinJ his
head down the beach. “, need to talk to you for a second, and , don't want to
wake up your friend there.”

       “Talk  to me about what?”

       “How  , can help you out. Now, come on, do you want help or not?”

       “Sure,”  Nell said.

256
       “Okay. C'mon then,” the stranJer said, risinJ to his feet. He took a step
toward Nell, bent down, and held out one hand.

       Nell   reached for  him  with  her  left  and  at the  last minute  flunJ   a
handful of sand into his face with her riJht. “Fuck!”  the stranJer said. “You
little bitch, ,'m Jonna Jet you for that.”

       The nunchuks were, as always, under Harv's head. Nell yanked them
out and turned back toward the stranJer, spinninJ her  whole body around
and snappinJ her wrist at the last moment Must as DoMo had tauJht her. The
end of the nunchuk struck the stranJer's left kneecap like a steel cobra, and
she heard somethinJ crack. The stranJer screamed, astonishinJly loud, and
toppled into the sand. Nell spun the nunchuks around, workinJ them up to a
hum, and drew a bead on his temporal bone. But  before she could strike,
Harv Jrabbed her wrist.  The  free end of  the weapon spun around out  of
control and bonked her on the eyebrow, splittinJ  it  open and JivinJ  her a
total-body ice-cream headache. She wanted to throw up.

       “Good  one, Nell,”  he said, “but  now's the time  to Jet the  hell out of
here.”

       She snatched up the Primer. The two of them ran off down the beach,
MumpinJ over the silver larvae that Jlittered noisily in the mediatronic liJht.
“The cops are probably Jonna be after  us now,”  Harv said. “We  Jotta Jo
somewhere.”

       “Grab one of those blankets,” Nell said. “, have an idea.”

       They  had left their  own silvery  blanket behind. A  discarded one was
overflowinJ from  a wastebasket by the seawall, so Harv snatched it as they
ran by and crumpled it into a wad.

       Nell  led Harv back to the little patch of forest. They found their way to
the little  cavity where they had stopped earlier. This time, Nell  spread the
blanket over both of  them, and they tucked it  in  all around themselves to
make a bubble. They waited Tuietly for a minute, then five, then ten. From

257
time to time they  heard the thin whine of a pod  JoinJ by, but they  always
kept on JoinJ, and before they knew it they were asleep.


                      Mysterious souvenir from Dr.  X; Hackworth's
                   arrival  in Vancouver; the Atlantan  quarter of that 
                       city;  he acquires a new mode of conveyance. 



Dr.  ;    had  dispatched a  messenJer to   the  ShanJhai  Aerodrome  with
instructions to seek out Hackworth.  The messenJer had sidled up next to
him while   he was addressinJ a  piss-trouJh, Jreeted him  cheerfully,  and
taken a piss  himself.  Then the  two  men had  exchanJed business cards,
acceptinJ them with both hands and a sliJht bow.

       Hackworth's card was about as flashy as he was. ,t was white, with his
name stamped out in rather severe capitals. Like most cards, it was made of
smart paper and  had lots  of  memory  space left  over  to  store diJiti]ed
information.  This  particular  copy  contained a  matter  compiler  proJram
descended from  the  one   that  had  created  the  oriJinal   Young Lady's
Illustrated   Primer.    This   revision   used   automatic   voice    Jeneration
alJorithms instead of relyinJ on professional ractors, and it contained all of
the hooks that Dr. ;'s coders would need to translate the text into Chinese.

       The Doctor's card was more picturesTue. ,t had a few Han]i characters
scrawled across it and also bore Dr. ;'s   chop. Now that  paper was smart,
chops were dynamic.  The stamp  infused the  paper with  a proJram  that
caused it to run a little  Jraphics proJram  forever. Dr. ;'s   chop depicted a
poxy-lookinJ  Jaffer  with  a conical hat  slunJ on his  back, sTuattinJ on  a
rock in a river with a bamboo pole, haulinJ a fish out of the water—no wait,
it wasn't a fish, it was a draJon sTuirminJ on the end of the line, and Must as
you reali]ed it,  the Jaffer turned and smiled at you insolently. This kitschy
tableau then   free]e-framed  and  morphed  cleverly   into   the  characters
representinJ Dr. ;'s   name. Then it  looped back to  the beJinninJ.  On the
back of the card were a few  mediaJlyphs indicatinJ  that it  was, in fact,  a
chit: that is  to say, a  totipotent proJram for  a  matter compiler, combined
with sufficient  ucus to run it.  The mediaJlyphs indicated that it would  run

258
only  on a  matter  compiler  of  eiJht  cubic  meters or  larJer,  which  was
enormous, and which made it obvious he was not to use it until he reached
America.

       He  debarked from the HanMin Takhoma at Vancouver, which besides
havinJ the  most scenic  airship mooraJe in  the  world,  boasted a si]able
Atlantan clave. Dr. ;   hadn't Jiven him a specific  destination—Must the chit
and a fliJht  number—so there didn't seem any point in  stayinJ aboard all
the way to the end of the line. From here he could always bullet-train down
the coast if necessary.

       The city  itself  was a sprawlinJ ba]aar of  claves. ConseTuently it was
Jenerously supplied with aJoras, owned and manaJed by Protocol, where
citi]ens and subMects of different phyles could convene on neutral Jround
and trade, neJotiate, fornicate, or whatever. Some of the aJoras were simply
open pla]as in  the classical tradition,  others looked more like  convention
centers or office   buildinJs.  Many  of  Old  Vancouver's pricier  and  more
view-endowed precincts  had been  acTuired by  the  HonJ  KonJ  Mutual
Benevolent Society or the Nipponese, and the Confucians owned the tallest
office buildinJ  in the downtown area. East of town in the fertile delta of the
Fraser River, the Slavs and the Germans were both supposed to have larJe
patches of Lebensraum staked out, surrounded by Jrids of somewhat nastier
than usual security pods. Hindustan had a spray of tiny claves all over the
metropolitan area.

       The  Atlantis  clave climbed out  of  the water half  a mile  west of  the
university, to which  it  was Moined by a causeway. ,mperial Tectonics had
made it look  like  Must another island, as if it had  been sittinJ there for  a
million   years.  As  Hackworth's   rented  velocipede  took   him  over   the
causeway, cool salt  air  flowinJ  throuJh  his  stubble,  he beJan to  relax,
findinJ himself  once aJain on home territory. On an emerald Jreen playinJ
field above the breakwater, younJ boys in  short pants were knotted into a
scrum, playinJ at fieldball.

       On  the opposite side of the road was the  Jirls' school,  which had its
own playinJ  field of  eTual si]e,  except that this one was surrounded by a

259
dense twelve-foot   hedJe so that  the Jirls   could  run around  in  very  little   or
skin-tiJht  clothinJ   without  JivinJ   rise to  etiTuette problems.  He hadn't  slept
well  in  his  microberth   and wouldn't   have  minded  checkinJ  into   the Juest
hostel  and  takinJ   a nap,  but   it  was  only   eleven  in  the  morninJ   and  he
couldn't  see wastinJ   the  day.  So he  rode  his  velocipede   to  the  center of
town, stopped  in at the  first  pub he saw, and  had lunch.  The bartender  Jave
him directions  to the  Royal Post Office,   which  was Must a few blocks away.

        The post  office  was  a biJ  one, sportinJ   a variety  of  matter  compilers,
includinJ   a  ten-cubic-meter   model  directly   adMacent to the  loadinJ   dock.
Hackworth   shoved  Dr.  ;'s    chit   into  its   reader  and  held  his  breath.  But
nothinJ  dramatic  happened;  the display   on the  control  panel  said  that this
Mob was JoinJ to take a couple of hours.

        Hackworth   killed   most  of  the time   wanderinJ  around  the  clave.  The
middle  of town  was  smallish  and Tuickly  Jave  way  to leafy  neiJhborhoods
filled  with   maJnificent   GeorJian,  Victorian,   and RomanesTue homes,  with
the occasional   ruJJed  Tudor   perched on  a  rise  or  nestled  into  a  verdant
hollow.  Beyond  the homes was a belt  of  Jentrified  farms  minJled   with  Jolf
courses and parks.  He  sat down  on  a bench  in  one flowery   public   Jarden
and unfolded  the  sheet of  mediatronic  paper  that  was keepinJ  track  of  the
movements of  the oriJinal  copy  of the Young Lady's  Illustrated  Primer.

        ,t  seemed to  have  spent some  time  in  a Jreenbelt   and then  made  its
way up the hill   in the Jeneral  direction  of the New  Atlantis  Clave.

        Hackworth  took  out his  fountain  pen and wrote  a short letter  addressed
to Lord  Finkle-McGraw.

 

      Your Grace,

 

      Since acceptinJ the trust you have reposed in me, , have endeavoured to be perfectly frank,
      servinJ as an open conduit for all information pertaininJ to the task at hand. ,n that spirit, , must

260
       inform you that two years aJo, in my desperate search for the lost copy of the Primer, , initiated
       a search of the Leased Territories .         .         . (&c.., &c..)

       Please find enclosed a map and other data reJardinJ the recent movements of this book, whose
       whereabouts were unknown to me until yesterday. , have no way of knowinJ who possesses it,
       but Jiven the book's proJramminJ, , suspect it to be a younJ thete Jirl, probably between the
       aJes of five and seven. The book must have remained indoors for the last two years, or else my
       systems would have detected it. ,f these suppositions are correct, and if my invention has not
       fallen desperately short of intentions, then it is safe to assume that the book has become an
       important part of the Jirl's life …

 


         He   went   on   to  write    that   the   book   should    not   be  taken   from    the   Jirl    if
this   were   the   case;   but   thinkinJ      about   it   a  bit   more    carefully,     he   scribbled
out   that     part    of    the   letter     and    it   vanished      from     the    paJe.    ,t    was    not
Hackworth's      role   to   tell   Finkle-McGraw         how    to  manaJe    affairs.     He  siJned
the  letter   and  dispatched     it.

         Half    an  hour   letter,   his  pen   chimed    aJain   and  he  checked    his  mail.

 

       Hackworth,

 

       MessaJe received. Better late than never. Can't wait to meet the Jirl.

       Yours &c.

       Finkle-McGraw

 


         When    Hackworth       Jot   back    to  the   post   office     and   looked    throuJh     the
window     of  the  biJ    matter   compiler,      he  saw  a  larJe   machine     takinJ    shape   in
the  dim    red   liJht.    ,ts   body    had   already     been   finished     and   was   now    risinJ
slowly     as   its   four     leJs    were    compiled      underneath.      Dr.    ;     had    provided
Hackworth      with   a chevaline.

261
       Hackworth  noted, not without  approval, that this one's enJineers had
put a  hiJh  priority  on  the  virtues of   simplicity  and  strenJth and a  low
priority on comfort and style. Very Chinese. No effort was made to disJuise
it  as a  real  animal. Much   of  the  mechanical business in  the  leJs was
exposed so that you could see how the Moints and pushrods worked, a little
like  starinJ at the  wheels of  an old  steam locomotive.  The body  looked
Jaunt and skeletal. ,t was made of star-shaped connectors where five or six
ciJarette-si]e rods would  come toJether, the rods and connectors forminJ
into an irreJular web that wrapped around into a Jeodesic space frame. The
rods could  chanJe their  lenJth.  Hackworth  knew from  seeinJ  the same
construction elsewhere that the web could chanJe its si]e and shape to an
ama]inJ  deJree while  providinJ   whatever  combination of   stiffness and
flexibility   the controllinJ  system needed at the moment. ,nside  the space
frame Hackworth  could  see aluminum-plated  spheres and ellipsoids,  no
doubt vacuum-filled, containinJ  the mount's machine-phase Juts: basically
some rod loJic and an enerJy source.

       The  leJs compiled Tuickly,  the complicated  feet took  a little  lonJer.
When it was finished, Hackworth released the vacuum and opened the door.
“Fold,”  he said. The chevaline's leJs buckled, and it lay down on the floor
of the M.C.  ,ts  space frame contracted as much as it could,  and its neck
shortened. Hackworth bent down, laced his finJers throuJh the space frame,
and lifted the chevaline with  one hand. He carried it  throuJh the lobby  of
the post office, past bemused customers, and out the door onto the street.

       “Mount,”   he said. The chevaline rose into a crouch. Hackworth threw
one leJ over its  saddle, which was padded with some kind of  elastomeric
stuff, and  immediately  felt  it  shovinJ him  into  the  air. His  feet  left  the
Jround and flailed  around until they  found the stirrups. A  lumbar support
pressed thouJhtfully on his kidneys, and then the chevaline trotted into the
street and beJan headinJ back toward the causeway.

       ,t  wasn't supposed to do that. Hackworth was about to tell  it  to stop.
Then he fiJured  out  why he'd  Jotten the chit  at  the last minute:  Dr. ;'s
enJineers had been proJramminJ somethinJ into this mount's brain, tellinJ
it where to take him.

262
       “Name?” Hackworth  said.

       “8nnamed,”  the chevaline said.

       “Rename Kidnapper,” Hackworth said.

       “Name  Kidnapper,” said Kidnapper;  and sensinJ that it was reachinJ
the edJe of the business district, it started to canter. Within  a few minutes
they were blastinJ across the causeway at a tantivy. Hackworth turned back
toward  Atlantis  and  looked  for   pursuinJ  aerostats; but  if   Napier  was
trackinJ him, he was doinJ so with some subtlety.


                    A morning  stroll through  the Leased Territories;
                                Dovetail;  a congenial Constable. 



HiJh up the mountain before them, they could see St. Mark's Cathedral and
hear its bells rinJinJ  chanJes, mostly Must tuneless seTuences of notes, but
sometimes a pretty melody would tumble out, like an unexpected Jem from
the permutations of the I  Ching. The  Diamond Palace of  Source Victoria
Jlittered peach and amber as it cauJht the sunrise, which was still  hidden
behind the mountain. Nell  and Harv had slept surprisinJly  well  under the
silver blanket, but they had not by any means slept late. The martial reveille
from  the Sendero Clave had  woken them,  and by  the time  they  hit  the
streets aJain, Sendero's burly Korean and ,ncan evanJelists were already
pourinJ out of their Jate into the common byways of the Leased Territories,
humpinJ their foldinJ  mediatrons and heavy crates of little red books. “We
could Jo  in there, Nell,”   Harv said, and  Nell  thouJht he must be  MokinJ.
“Always plenty to eat and a warm cot in Sendero.”

       “They  wouldn't let me keep my book,” Nell said.

       Harv looked at her, mildly  startled. “How  do you know? Oh, don't tell
me, you learned it from the Primer.”

263
       “They  only have one book in Sendero, and it tells them to burn all the
other books.”

       As  they climbed toward  the Jreenbelt, the way Jot  steeper and Harv
started whee]inJ. From time  to time  he would stop with  his  hands on his
knees and couJh in hiJh  hoarse bursts like the bark of  a seal. But the air
was cleaner up here, they could  tell  by  the way it  felt  JoinJ  down  their
throats, and it was colder too, which helped.

       A  band of forest surrounded the hiJh central plateau of New  Chusan.
The clave called Dovetail backed riJht up aJainst this Jreenbelt and was no
less densely wooded, thouJh from a distance it had a finer  texture—more
and smaller trees, and many flowers.

       Dovetail  was surrounded by  a fence  made of iron  bars and  painted
black. Harv took  one look  at it  and said it  was a Moke if that was all  the
security they had. Then he Jot to  noticinJ that  the fence was lined with  a
Jreensward  about   a   stone's  throw    in    width,   smooth   enouJh   for
championship croTuet.  He   raised  his  eyebrows  siJnificantly    at  Nell,
implyinJ that any unauthori]ed personnel who tried to walk across it would
be impaled on hydraulic stainless-steel spikes or shot throuJh with cookie-
cutters or rent by robot doJs.

       The Jates to  Dovetail  stood wide open, which  deeply alarmed Harv.
He Jot in  front  of Nell  lest she try  to run throuJh  them. At  the boundary
line, the pavement chanJed from  the usual hard-but-flexible,  smooth-but-
hiJh-traction nanostuff to an irreJular mosaic of Jranite blocks.

       The only human in evidence was a white-haired Constable whose belly
had created a visible diverJence between his two rows of brass buttons. He
was bent over usinJ a trowel  to extract a  steaminJ turd from  the emerald
Jrass. Circumstances suJJested that it had come from  one of  two  corJis
who were even now slamminJ their preposterous bodies into each other not
far away, tryinJ to roll  each other over, which runs contrary to the laws of
mechanics even in the case of corJis  that are lean and  trim,  which these
were not.  This  struJJle,  which  appeared to  be only   one skirmish  in   a

264
conflict  of epochal standinJ, had driven  all  lesser considerations, such as
JuardinJ the Jate, from  the combatants' sphere of attention, and so it was
the Constable  who  first  noticed  Nell   and Harv.  “Away   with  you!”   he
hollered cheerfully   enouJh,  wavinJ  his  redolent  trowel  down  the  hill.
“We've no work for such as you today! And the free matter compilers are all
down by the waterfront.”

       The effect  of  this news on Harv  was contrary to  what the Constable
had intended, for it implied that sometimes there was work for such as him.
He stepped forward  alertly. Nell  took  advantaJe of  this to  run  out from
behind him. “Pardon me, sir,” she called, “we're not here for work or to Jet
free thinJs, but to find someone who belonJs to this phyle.”

       The Constable straiJhtened his tunic and sTuared his shoulders at the
appearance of this little Jirl, who looked like a thete but talked like a Vicky.
Suspicion Jave  way  to  benevolence, and he ambled  toward  them after
shoutinJ a  few  imprecations  at  his  doJs, who  evidently   suffered from
advanced hearinJ loss. “Very well,” he said. “Who  is it that you're lookinJ
for?”

       “A  man by the name of Brad. A blacksmith. He works at a stable in the
New Atlantis Clave, takinJ care of horses.”

       “,  know him well,”  the Constable said. “,'d be Jlad to rinJ him for you.
You're a .         .         . friend of his, then?”

       “We  should like  to think  that he remembers us favorably,” Nell  said.
Harv turned around and  made a face at her  for talkinJ   this way, but  the
Constable was eatinJ it up.

       “,t's  a  brisk  morninJ,”  the Constable said. “Why   don't you  Moin me
inside the Jatehouse, where it's nice and co]y, and ,'ll Jet you some tea.”

       On either side of  the main Jate, the fence terminated in a small stone
tower with  narrow diamond-paned windows set deeply into its  walls. The
Constable entered one of these from his side of the fence and then opened a
heavy wooden door with huJe wrouJht-iron hinJes, lettinJ Nell and Harv in

265
from their  side. The tiny octaJonal room  was cluttered with  fine furniture
made of dark wood, a shelf of old books, and a small cast-iron stove with a
red enamel kettle  on top,  pocked like  an  asteroid from  ancient impacts,
pipinJ out a tenuous column of  steam. The Constable directed them into a
pair of  wooden  chairs. TryinJ   to  scoot them  back from  the  table, they
discovered that each was ten  times the weiJht  of  any  other chair  they'd
seen, beinJ made of actual wood, and thick pieces of it too. They were not
especially comfortable,   but  Nell   liked  sittinJ   in   hers nevertheless, as
somethinJ about its  si]e  and weiJht  Jave  her a  feelinJ  of  security. The
windows on the Dovetail  side of the Jatehouse were larJer, and she could
see the two  corJi  doJs outside, peerinJ  in  throuJh the  lead latticework,
flabberJasted that they had, throuJh some enormous lacuna in procedure,
been left on the outside, waJJinJ their tails somewhat uncertainly, as if, in a
world that allowed such mistakes, nothinJ could be counted on.

       The  Constable found a  wooden tray  and carried  it  about the room,
cautiously assemblinJ  a collection  of  cups,  saucers, spoons, tonJs, and
other tea-related armaments. When all the  necessary tools were properly
laid  out,  he manufactured the  beveraJe, hewinJ   closely  to  the ancient
procedure, and set it before them.

       RestinJ on a counter by the window was an outlandishly shaped black
obMect that Nell recoJni]ed as a telephone, only because she had seen them
on the old passives that her mother liked to watch—where they seemed to
take on a talismanic siJnificance out of proportion to what they actually did.
The Constable picked up a piece of paper on which many names and strinJs
and diJits had been hand-written. He turned his back to the nearest window,
then leaned backward over the counter so as to brinJ most of him closer to
its illumination.   He tilted   the paper into  the  liJht  and then  adMusted the
elevation of his  own chin throuJh  a rather sweepinJ arc, converJinJ on  a
position that placed the lenses of his readinJ spectacles between pupil and
paJe. HavinJ maneuvered all of these elements into the optimal Jeometry,
he let out a little siJh, as thouJh the arranJement suited him, and peered up
over his Jlasses at Nell and Harv  for a moment, as if  to suJJest that they
could learn  some valuable  tricks  by  keepinJ a  sharp eye  on  him.  Nell

266
watched him,   fascinated  not  least  because she  rarely  saw  people  in
spectacles.

       The Constable returned his attention to the piece of paper and scanned
it with  a furrowed  brow  for  a few  minutes before suddenly callinJ  out a
series of several numbers, which sounded random to his visitors but seemed
both deeply siJnificant and perfectly obvious to the Constable.

       The black telephone sported a metal disk with finJer-si]e  holes bored
around its edJe. The Constable hooked the phone's handset over his epaulet
and then beJan to insert his finJer into various of these holes, usinJ them to
torTue the disk around aJainst the countervailinJ force of a sprinJ. A brief
but  exceedinJly  cheerful   conversation ensued.  Then  he  hunJ  up   the
telephone and clasped his hands over his belly, as if he had accomplished
his assiJned tasks so completely that said extremities were now superfluous
decorations. “,t'll  be a minute,”  he said. “Please take your time, and don't
scald yourselves on that tea. Care for some shortbread?”

       Nell  was not familiar  with  this deliJht.  “No  thank you, sir,”  she said,
but Harv, ever praJmatic,  allowed as he miJht  enMoy some. Suddenly the
Constable's hands found a  new reason for  existence and beJan  to busy
themselves explorinJ the darker corners of old wooden cupboards here and
there around the little room. “By  the way,”  he said absent-mindedly, as he
pursued this Tuest, “if you  had in mind  actually passinJ through the Jate,
that is to say, if you  wanted to visit Dovetail,  as you would be abundantly
welcome to do, then you should know a few thinJs about our rules.”

       He  stood up  and turned  toward them,  displayinJ  a tin  box  labeled
SHORTBREAD.

       “To  be specific, the younJ Jentleman's chocky sticks and switchblade
will  have to come out of his trousers and lodJe here, in the lovinJ  care of
me and my  colleaJues, and , will   have to have a  Jood lonJ  look  at that
monstrous chunk of rod loJic,  batteries, sensor arrays, and what-have-you
that the younJ lady is carryinJ in her little knapsack, concealed, unless , am
mistaken, in  the  Juise of   a book.  Hmmm?”  And   the Constable turned

267
toward them with  his eyebrows raised very hiJh  on his forehead, shakinJ
the plaid box.

       Constable Moore, as he introduced himself, examined Harv's weapons
with more care than really seemed warranted, as if they were relics freshly
exhumed from  a  pyramid.  He  took  care  to  compliment  Harv  on  their
presumed effectiveness, and to meditate aloud on the Jrave foolishness of
anyone's messinJ about with a younJ fellow like  Harv. The weapons went
into one of the cupboards, which Constable Moore locked by talkinJ  to it.
“And now the book, younJ lady,” he said to Nell, pleasantly enouJh.

       She didn't want to let the Primer out of her hands, but she remembered
the kids at the playroom who had tried to take it from her and been shocked,
or somethinJ, for  their  trouble.  So she handed it  over. Constable Moore
took it very  carefully in  both hands, and a tiny little  moan of  appreciation
escaped his lips. “, should inform  you  that sometimes it does rather nasty
thinJs to people who, as it  supposes, are tryinJ to steal it  from  me,” Nell
said, then bit her lip, hopinJ she hadn't implied that Constable Moore was a
thief.

       “YounJ  lady, , should be crestfallen if it didn't.”

       After  Constable Moore had turned the  book over in  his hands a few
times, complimentinJ Nell  on  the bindinJ,  the Jold  script, the feel  of the
paper, he set it down JinJerly on  the table, first rubbinJ  his hand over the
wood to ensure no tea or suJar had earlier been spilled there. He wandered
away from  the table and seemed to stumble at random upon an oak-and-
brass copier that sat in one of the obtuse corners of the octaJonal room. He
happened upon a few paJes in its output tray and went throuJh them for a
bit, from time to  time chucklinJ ruefully.  At one point he looked up at Nell
and shook his head wordlessly before finally sayinJ, “Do you have any idea
…”  but then he Must chuckled aJain, shook his head, and went back to the
papers.

       “RiJht,”   he finally said, “riJht.”  He fed the papers back into the copier
and told it to  destroy them. He thrust his fists into  his trouser pockets and

268
walked up and down  the lenJth  of  the room twice,  then sat down  aJain,
lookinJ not  at Nell  and Harv and not at the book, but  somewhere off into
the distance. “RiJht,”  he said. “,  will  not  confiscate the book durinJ your
stay in Dovetail, if  you follow   certain conditions. First of  all, you will   not
under any circumstances make use of a matter compiler. Secondly, the book
is for  your use, and your use only. Third,  you will   not copy or  reproduce
any of the information contained in the book. Fourth, you will not show the
book to anyone here or make anyone aware of  its existence. Violation  of
any  of  these  conditions  will   lead  to   your  immediate  expulsion  from
Dovetail and the  confiscation and probable destruction of  the book. Do  ,
make myself clear?”

       “Perfectly  clear, sir,”   Nell  said. Outside, they  heard the thrudalump
thrudalump of an approachinJ horse.


                 A  new friend; Nell  sees a real horse; a ride through
                            Dovetail; Nell  and Harv are separated. 



The person on the horse was not Brad, it was a woman Nell and Harv didn't
know. She  had straiJht  reddish-blond hair,  pale  skin with   thousands of
freckles,  and carrot-colored  eyebrows  and  eyelashes that  were  almost
invisible except when the sun Jra]ed her face. “,'m a friend of  Brad's,” she
said. “He's at work. Does he know you?”

       Nell  was about to pipe  up, but Harv  shushed her with a hand on her
arm and Jave  the woman  a somewhat more  abridJed version  than Nell
miJht have provided. He mentioned that Brad had been “a friend  of” their
mother's for  a  while,  that  he  had always  treated them  kindly   and had
actually taken them to the NAC to see the horses. Not far into the story, the
blank  expression on  the  woman's face  was  replaced by  one  that  was
somewhat more Juarded, and she stopped listeninJ. “, think Brad told  me
about you once,”  she finally  said  when Harv  had wandered into  a blind
alley. “,   know he  remembers you. So what  is  it  that you  would  like  to
happen now?”

269
       This   was  a   poser. Nell   and   Harv  had   settled  into   a  habit   of
concentratinJ very stronJly  on what they would  like  not to  happen. They
were baffled by options, which to them seemed like dilemmas. Harv left off
clutchinJ  Nell's  arm  and  took  her  hand instead.  Neither  of  them  said
anythinJ.

       “Perhaps,” Constable Moore finally  said, after the woman  had turned
to him  for a cue, “it   would  be useful for  the two  of you  to set awhile  in
some safe, Tuiet place and Jather your thouJhts.”

       “That  would do nicely, thank you,” Nell said.

       “Dovetail  contains many public parks and Jardens …”

       “ForJet  it,”  the woman said, knowinJ  her cue when she heard it. “,'ll
take them back  to the  Millhouse  until  Brad  Jets home. Then,”  she said
siJnificantly to the Constable, “we'll fiJure somethinJ out.”

       The woman stepped out of the Jatehouse briskly, not lookinJ  back at
Nell and Harv. She was tall and wore a pair of  loose khaki trousers, much
worn at the knees but hardly at all in the seat, and splotched here and there
with  old  unidentifiable  stains.  Above  that she  wore  a very  loose  ,rish
fisherman's sweater, sleeves rolled up and safety-pinned to  form a  dense
woolen torus orbitinJ each of her freckled forearms, the motif  echoed by a
whorl of  cheap silver banJles on each wrist. She was mutterinJ somethinJ
in the direction  of  her horse, an Appaloosa mare who had already swunJ
her neck down  and beJun to nu]]le   at  the disappointinJly  close-cropped
Jrass inside the fence, lookinJ for a blade or two that had not been marked
by the assiduous corJis. When she stopped to stroke the mare's neck, Nell
and Harv  cauJht up  with  her and  learned that she was  simply  JivinJ  a
simplified  account of what  had Must happened in the Jatehouse, and what
was JoinJ to happen now, all delivered rather absentmindedly, Must in case
the mare miJht  want to  know. For  a moment Nell  thouJht  that the mare
miJht actually  be a chevaline dressed up in a fake horse skin,  but then it
eMected a stream of urine the dimensions of a fencepost, JlitterinJ  like  a
liJht saber in the morninJ  sun and clad in a torn  cloak of  steam, and Nell

270
smelled it  and knew  the horse was real.  The woman  did  not mount  the
horse, which  she had apparently  ridden  bareback, but took  its  reins  as
Jently  as if   they  were cobwebs  and led  the  horse  on. Nell   and  Harv
followed, a few  paces behind, and the woman walked across the Jreen for
some time, apparently orJani]inJ thinJs in her mind, before finally  tuckinJ
her  hair  behind  her  ear  on  one side  and  turninJ   toward  them.  “Did
Constable Moore talk to you about rules at all?”

       “What  rules?” Harv  blurted before Nell  could Jet into  it in  a level of
detail that miJht have cast a neJative liJht  on them. Nell marveled for  the
hundredth time at her brother's multifarious  trickiness, which  would  have
done Peter himself proud.

       “We make thinJs,”  the woman said, as if this provided a nearly perfect
and sufficient   explanation  of  the  phyle   called  Dovetail.  “Brad   makes
horseshoes. But Brad's the exception because mostly he provides services
relatinJ to horses. Doesn't he, EJJshell?” the woman added for the mare's
benefit. “That's why  he had to live  down  in the L.T.  for  a while, because
there was disaJreement as to whether Jrooms,  butlers, and other  service
providers fit in with  Dovetail's charter. But we had a vote and decided to let
them in. This is borinJ you, isn't it? My name's Rita, and , make paper.”

       “You  mean, in the M.C.?”

       This seemed like an obvious Tuestion to Nell, but Rita was surprised to
hear it and eventually lauJhed it  off.  “,'ll   show you later. But  what ,  was
JettinJ  at  is  that,  unlike  where you've  been  livinJ,   everythinJ  here at
Dovetail was made by hand. We have a few matter compilers here. But  if
we want a chair, say, one of our craftsmen will put it toJether out of wood,
Must like in ancient times.”

       “Why   don't you  Must compile it?”  Harv  said. “The  M.C.  can  make
wood.”

       “,t  can make fake wood,”  Rita said, “but  some people don't like fake
thinJs.”

271
       “Why  don't you like fake thinJs?” Nell asked.

       Rita smiled at her. “,t's not Must us. ,t's them,” she said, pointinJ up the
mountain toward the belt  of hiJh  trees that separated Dovetail from  New
Atlantis territory.

       LiJht   dawned on Harv's face. “The  Vickys  buy  stuff  from you!”   he
said.

       Rita  looked  a  little  surprised,  as if   she'd never heard  them called
Vickys before. “Anyway,  what was , JettinJ  at? Oh, yeah, the point is that
everythinJ here is uniTue, so you have to be careful with it.”

       Nell  had a rouJh idea of what uniTue was, but Harv didn't, and so Rita
explained it for a while as they walked throuJh Dovetail. At  some lenJth it
dawned on both Nell and Harv that Rita was actually tryinJ to tell  them, in
the most bewilderinJly  circumspect way  imaJinable, that  she didn't want
them to  run   around and  break  stuff.  This  approach  to  child  behavior
modification  was so at  odds with  everythinJ  they knew  that, in  spite of
Rita's efforts to be pleasant, the conversation was bliJhted by confusion on
the children's part and frustration on  hers. From time to  time her freckles
vanished as her face turned red.

       Where Dovetail had streets, they were paved with little blocks of stone
laid close toJether. The vehicles were horses, chevalines, and velocipedes
with fat  knobby  tires. Except  for  one spot where a  number of  buildinJs
clustered toJether around a central Jreen, houses were widely spaced and
tended to be very  small or  very  larJe. All   of  them seemed to have nice
Jardens thouJh, and from time to time Nell would dart off the road to smell
a flower. At first Rita would  watch her nervously, tellinJ her not to pick any
of the flowers as they belonJed to other people.

       At  the end  of a road  was a wooden Jate with  a  lauJhably primitive
latch consistinJ of a slidinJ  plank, Jlossy with  use. Past the Jate, the road
became a very  rouJh mosaic  of  flaJstones with  Jrass JrowinJ   between
them.  ,t   wound   between  undulatinJ  pastures  where  horses  and  the
occasional dairy cow Jra]ed and eventually terminated at a Jreat three-story

272
stone buildinJ perched on the bank of  a river that ran down  the mountain
from the  New Atlantis  Clave. A  Jiant  wheel Jrew  out  of the  side of the
buildinJ  and spun slowly  as the river  pushed on it. A  man  stood outside
before a larJe choppinJ-block, usinJ a hatchet with  an exceptionally wide
blade to split thin wedJes of red wood from  a loJ. These were piled into a
wicker basket that was hauled up on a rope by a man who stood on the roof,
replacinJ some of the old Jray shinJles with these new red ones.

       Harv   was  paraly]ed  with   wonder  at  this   exhibition  and  stopped
walkinJ. Nell  had seen much the same sort of process at work in the paJes
of her  Primer. She followed  Rita  over to  a lonJ  low  buildinJ  where  the
horses lived.

       Most of  the people did not live in the Millhouse proper but in a couple
of lonJ  outbuildinJs,  two  stories each, with  workshops below and livinJ
Tuarters above. Nell was a little surprised to see that Rita did  not actually
live with  Brad.  Her apartment and her  shop were each twice  the si]e  of
Nell's old  flat  and filled   with  fine  thinJs  of  heavy wood,  metal, cotton,
linen, and porcelain that, as Nell was beJinninJ to understand, had all been
made by human hands, probably riJht here in Dovetail.

       Rita's shop had Jreat kettles where she would brew thick fibrous stew.
She spread the stew thinly over screens to draw out the water and flattened
it with  a Jreat  hand-cranked press to make paper, thick and rouJh-edJed
and subtly colored from  the  thousands of tiny  fibers wendinJ  throuJh it.
When she had a stack of paper made, she would take it next door to a shop
with a sharp oily smell, where a bearded man with a smudJed apron would
run it throuJh another biJ hand-cranked machine. When it came out of this
machine, it had letters on the top, JivinJ the name and address of a lady in
New Atlantis.

       Since Nell  had been decorous so far and not tried to stick her finJers
into the machinery and not driven anyone to distraction with her Tuestions,
Rita Jave her leave to visit  some of the other shops, as lonJ as she asked
permission at each one. Nell  spent most of  the  day makinJ  friends with

273
various shop owners: a Jlassblower, a Meweler, a cabinetmaker, a weaver,
even a toymaker who Jave her a tiny wooden doll in a calico dress.

       Harv spent awhile botherinJ the men who were puttinJ shinJles on the
roof, then wandered about in the fields  for most of  the day, kickinJ  small
rocks from place to place, Jenerally scopinJ out the boundaries and Jeneral
condition of the community  centered on the Millhouse. Nell checked in on
him from   time to  time.  At  first   he looked  tense and skeptical,  then he
relaxed and enMoyed it, and finally, late in the afternoon, he became surly
and perched himself on a boulder above the runninJ stream, tossinJ pebbles
into it, chewinJ his thumbnail, and thinkinJ.

       Brad   came home  early,  ridinJ    a  bay  stallion   straiJht  down  the
mountain from the New  Atlantis Clave, anJlinJ  throuJh the  Jreenbelt and
piercinJ the doJ pod Jrid  with  scant conseTuences as the authorities knew
him. Harv approached him with a formal mien, harrumphinJ phleJm out of
the way as he prepared to offer  up an explanation and a plea. But  Brad's
eyes merely Jlanced over Harv, settled on Nell, appraised her for a moment,
then looked away shyly. The verdict was that they could stay the niJht, but
all else depended on leJal niceties that were beyond his powers.

       “Have  you done anythinJ the ShanJhai Police miJht find interestinJ?”
Brad asked Harv  Jravely.  Harv  said no,  a  simple no  without  the  usual
technicalities, provisos, and subclauses.

       Nell  wanted to tell Brad everythinJ. But she had been noticinJ how, in
the Primer, whenever someone asked Peter Rabbit a direct Tuestion of any
kind, he always lied.

       “To  look at our Jreen fields and biJ  houses, you miJht think we're on
Atlantis turf  here,”  Brad said, “but  we're under ShanJhai Murisdiction Must
like  the rest of  the Leased Territories.  Now  usually the  ShanJhai Police
don't come around, because we are peaceable folk and  because we have
made certain arranJements with them. But if  it  were known that we  were
harborinJ runaway JanJ members—”

274
       “  'Nuff  said,” Harv blurted. ,t was clear that he had already worked all
of this out in  his head as he sat on the riverbank and was only waitinJ for
the adults to  catch up  with  his  loJic.  Before  Nell  understood what was
JoinJ on, he came up to her and Jave her a huJ and a kiss on the lips. Then
he turned away  from  her and beJan runninJ  across a Jreen  field,  down
toward the ocean. Nell ran after him, but she could not keep up, and finally
she fell  down in  a  stand of  bluebells and  watched Harv  dissolve into  a
curtain of tears. When she could no lonJer see him, she curled up sobbinJ,
and in time Rita  came and Jathered her up in her stronJ arms and carried
her slowly  back across the field to  the Millhouse  where the steady wheel
rolled.


                   Orphans of the Han are exposed to the benefits of
                modern educational technology;  Judge Fang reflects 
                     on the fundamental  precepts of Confucianism. 



The orphanaJe ships had built-in matter compilers, but  they could not,  of
course, be hooked up to Sources. ,nstead they drew their supplies of matter
from cubical containers, rather like tanks of atoms arranJed very precisely.
These containers could be loaded on board with cranes and hooked up to
the matter compilers  in  the same way  that  Feed lines would  be  if  they
resided on shore. The ships put in to ShanJhai freTuently, offloaded empty
containers, and took new ones on board—their hunJry populations were fed
almost exclusively on synthetic rice produced by the matter compilers.

       There were seven ships now. The first  five had been named after the
Master's Five Virtues, and after  that they had taken to  naminJ them after
maMor Confucian philosophers. -udJe FanJ flew out to the one named (as
best it  could  be  translated into  EnJlish)  Generosity of  Soul,  personally
carryinJ the M.C. proJram  in the sleeve of his Jarment. This was the very
ship he had visited on  the eventful niJht  of his  boat ride with  Dr.  ;,   and
ever since then he had  somehow felt closer  to these fifty   thousand little
mice than any of the other Tuarter-million in the other vessels.

275
       The proJram was written to work in  a bulk compiler, extrudinJ do]ens
of  Primers each cycle.  When  the  first  batch  was finished,  -udJe  FanJ
plucked out one of  the  new volumes, inspected its  cover, which  had the
appearance of  marbled  Made, flipped  throuJh  the  paJes  admirinJ   the
illustrations, and cast a critical eye over the calliJraphy.

       Then he carried it  down a  corridor and into  a playroom where a few
hundred little mice were runninJ around, blowinJ  off steam. He cauJht the
eye of  one Jirl   and beckoned her  over. She came, reluctantly,  chivvied
alonJ by an enerJetic teacher who alternated between smilinJ to the Jirl and
bowinJ to -udJe FanJ.

       He  sTuatted so that he could look her in  the eye and handed her the
book. She was much more interested in the book than in  -udJe FanJ, but
she had been tauJht the proper  formalities  and bowed and thanked him.
Then she opened it up. Her eyes Jot wide. The book beJan to talk to her. To
-udJe FanJ  the voice  sounded a bit  dull,  the  rhythm  of  the speech not
exactly riJht. But the Jirl didn't care. The Jirl was hooked.

       -udJe  FanJ stood up  to find  himself  surrounded by a  hundred little
Jirls,  all  facinJ  toward the  little  Made book, standinJ on tiptoes, mouths
open.

       Finally  he had been able to  do somethinJ unambiJuously Jood  with
his position. ,n the Coastal Republic it  wouldn't have been possible; in the
Middle KinJdom,  which hewed to the words and spirit of the Master, it was
simply part of his duties.

       He turned and left the room; none of  the Jirls noticed, which was Must
as well, as they miJht have seen a Tuiver in his lip and a tear in his eye. As
he made his way  throuJh the corridors  toward the  upper deck where his
airship  awaited  him,  he  reviewed   for  the  thousandth  time  the  Great
LearninJ, the kernel of  the Master's thouJht:  The ancients who wished to
demonstrate illustrious virtue  throughout  the kingdom,  first  ordered well
their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their
families.  Wishing  to  regulate  their   families,  they  first   cultivated  their

276
persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their  hearts.
Wishing to  rectify  their  hearts,  they  first  sought to  be  sincere in   their
thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the
utmost  their    knowledge.  Such   extention  of    knowledge  lay    in   the
investigation of things. .         .          . From the Son of Heaven down to the
mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root
of everything besides.


                  Hackworth  receives an ambiguous message; a ride
                     through  Vancouver; tattooed woman and totem 
                  poles; he enters the hidden world of the Drummers. 



Kidnapper had a Jlove compartment of sorts hollowed into  the back of its
neck. As  he  was ridinJ   across the  causeway, Hackworth  opened it  up
because he wanted to see whether it was larJe enouJh to contain his bowler
without foldinJ,  bendinJ, spindlinJ, or mutilatinJ  the exTuisite hyperboloid
of its brim.  The answer was that it was Must a wee bit too small. But Dr. ;
had been thouJhtful enouJh to  toss in some snacks: a handful  of fortune
cookies, three of them to  be exact. They looked Jood.  Hackworth picked
one and snapped it  open. The strip  of  paper bore some kind  of  Jaudily
animated Jeometric pattern, lonJ strands of somethinJ  tumblinJ  end over
end and bouncinJ aJainst one  another. ,t looked  vaJuely familiar:  These
were supposed to be yarrow stalks, which Taoists used for divination. But
instead of forminJ a hexaJram of the I Ching, they beJan fallinJ into place,
one after another, in such a way  as to form  letters in the  pseudo-Chinese
typeface used in the loJos  of one-star Chinese restaurants. When the last
one had bounced into place, the fortune read:

       SEEK THE  ALCHEMIST.

       “Thanks  ever so much, Dr. ;,”    Hackworth snapped. He continued to
watch the fortune for  a while,  hopinJ that  it would  turn into  somethinJ a
little  more  informative,  but  it  was dead, Must a piece of  litter  now  and
forever.

277
       Kidnapper  slowed to  a canter  and cruised purposefully  throuJh  the
university, then turned north  and crossed a bridJe into  the peninsula that
contained most of Vancouver proper. The chevaline did a perfectly Jood Mob
of not steppinJ on  anyone, and Hackworth soon learned to stop worryinJ
and trust its instincts. This left his eyes free to wander throuJh the siJhts of
Vancouver, which had not been advisable when he'd come this way on the
velocipede. He had not noticed, before, the sheer maddeninJ profusion of
the place, each person seeminJly an ethnic Jroup of one, each with his or
her own costume, dialect, sect, and pediJree. ,t was as if,  sooner or later,
every part of  the world  became ,ndia and thus ceased to function  in  any
sense meaninJful to straiJht-arrow Cartesian rationalists like -ohn Percival
Hackworth, his family and friends.

       Shortly  after  passinJ the Aerodrome  they reached Stanley Park,  an
unruined peninsula  several miles  around,  which  had,  thank  God,  been
forked over to Protocol and kept much as it had always been, with the same
DouJlas firs  and mossy red  cedars that had been JrowinJ  there  forever.
Hackworth had been here a few times and had a vaJue idea of how it was
laid  out:  restaurants here and there,  paths alonJ  the  beach, a  ]oo  and
aTuarium, public playinJ fields.

       Kidnapper  took him  for  a nice  lope alonJ  a pebbly  beach and then
somewhat abruptly bounded up a slope, for  that purpose switchinJ into  a
Jait never used by any real horse. ,ts leJs shortened, and it clawed its way
surefootedly up  the  forty-five-deJree  surface  like  a  mountain  lion.  An
alarminJly Tuick ]iJ]aJ   throuJh  a stand of firs brouJht  them into an open
Jrassy area. Then Kidnapper slowed to  a mere walk,  as if  it  were a real
horse that had to  be cooled down  Jradually,  and took Hackworth  into  a
semicircle of old totem poles.

       A  younJ woman was here, standinJ before one of  the poles with her
hands clasped behind her back, which would have Jiven her an endearinJly
prim  appearance if   she  had  not  been  stark  naked and  covered  with
constantly shiftinJ mediatronic tattoos. Even her hair, which fell  loosely to
her waist,  had been infiltrated  with   some kind  of  nanosite so that  each
strand's color fluctuated from place to place accordinJ to a scheme not Must

278
now apparent to Hackworth. She was lookinJ  intently  at the  carvinJ of  a
totem pole and apparently not for the first time, for her tattoos were done in
much the same style.

       The woman was lookinJ at a totem pole dominated by a representation
of an orca, head down and tail up, dorsal fin proMectinJ hori]ontally out of
the pole and evidently  carved from  a separate piece of wood. The  orca's
blowhole had  a human face carved  around it.  The face's mouth  and the
orca's  blowhole   were  the   same  thinJ.   This   promiscuous  denial   of
boundaries was everywhere on the totem poles and on the woman's tattoo:
The starinJ eyes of a bear were also the faces of some other sort of creature.
The woman's navel was  also the mouth  of a  human face, much  like  the
orca's blowhole, and sometimes that face became the mouth of a larJer face
whose eyes were her nipples and whose Joatee was her pubic hair. But as
soon as he'd made out one pattern, it  would  chanJe into somethinJ  else,
because unlike the totem  poles the tattoo  was dynamic  and played with
imaJes in time the same way that the totem poles did in space.

       “Hello,  -ohn,”  she said. “,t's  too bad ,  loved you because you had to
leave.”

       Hackworth tried to find  her face, which should have been easy, it beinJ
the thinJ in the front of her head; but his eyes kept snaJJinJ on all the other
little  faces that came and went and flowed  into one another, time-sharinJ
her eyes, her mouth, even her  nostrils. And  he was startinJ  to recoJni]e
patterns in her  hair too,  which  was more than  he could  handle. He was
pretty sure he had Must cauJht a Jlimpse of Fiona in there.

       She turned her back on him, her hair spinninJ  out momentarily like  a
twirlinJ  skirt, and for that instant he could see throuJh it and beJin to make
sense of the imaJe.  He  was positive  that somewhere in  there he'd  seen
Gwen and Fiona walkinJ alonJ a beach.

       He dismounted from  Kidnapper and followed  her on foot.  Kidnapper
followed him  silently.  They walked across the park for  half  a mile  or so,
and Hackworth kept his distance because when he Jot too close to her, the

279
imaJes in her hair  bewildered his eyes. She took him to  a wild  stretch of
beach where immense DouJlas fir loJs lay scattered around. As Hackworth
clambered over the loJs tryinJ to keep up with the woman, he occasionally
cauJht a handhold that appeared to have been carved by someone lonJ aJo.

       The loJs  were palimpsests. Two of them  rose from the water's edJe,
not Tuite vertical,  stuck like  darts into the  impermanent sand. Hackworth
walked  between  them,  the  surf   crashinJ  around  his   knees. He   saw
weathered intimations of faces and wild beasts livinJ  in the wood, ravens,
eaJles, and wolves tanJled into orJanic skeins. The water was bitterly cold
on his leJs, and  he whooped in a  couple of breaths, but the  woman kept
walkinJ;  the water was up  past her waist now,  and her hair  was floatinJ
around her so that the translucent imaJes once aJain became readable. Then
she vanished beneath a collapsinJ wave two meters hiJh.

       The wave knocked Hackworth on his  backside and washed him alonJ
for a  short distance, flailinJ  his  arms and leJs. When  he Jot  his balance
back, he sat there for  a few  moments, lettinJ smaller  waves embrace his
waist and chest, waitinJ  for the woman  to come up for  a breath. But  she
didn't.

       There  was somethinJ  down  there. He  rolled  up  onto  his  feet  and
tramped straiJht into the ocean. -ust as the waves were cominJ up into his
face, his feet contacted somethinJ hard and smooth that Jave way beneath
him. He  was sucked downward as the water  plunJed into  a subterranean
void. A hatch slammed shut above his head, and suddenly he was breathinJ
air aJain. The liJht was silver. He was sittinJ in water up to his chest, but it
rapidly drained away, drawn off  by  some kind of  a pumpinJ  system, and
then he found himself lookinJ down a lonJ silvery  tunnel. The woman was
descendinJ it, a stone's throw ahead of him.

       Hackworth  had been in  a few  of  these, normally  in more  industrial
settinJs. The entrance was  duJ into  the  beach, but  the rest of  it   was a
floatinJ tunnel, a tube full of  air, moored to the bottom. ,t was a cheap way
to make space; the Nipponese used these thinJs  as sleepinJ Tuarters for
foreiJn  Juest workers.  The  walls  were  made  of  membranes that  drew

280
oxyJen from the surroundinJ seawater and eMected carbon dioxide, so that
seen from a fish's point of view, the tunnels steamed like hot pasta on a cold
steel plate as they excreted countless microbubbles of polluted CO2. These
thinJs extruded themselves into the  water like  the roots that  Jrew out  of
improperly stored potatoes, forkinJ  from time  to time,  carryinJ their  own
Feeds forward so  that they  could be  extended on command. They  were
empty and collapsed to beJin with, and when they knew they were finished,
they inflated themselves with scavenJed oxyJen and Jrew riJid.

       Now  that the cold water had drained out of Hackworth's ears, he could
hear a deep drumminJ that he'd mistaken at first  for  the crash of the surf
overhead; but this had a steadier beat that invited him forward.

       Down  the tunnel Hackworth walked, followinJ   the woman, and as he
went the liJht Jrew  dimmer and the tunnel narrower. He suspected that the
walls of the tunnel had mediatronic properties because he kept seeinJ thinJs
from the corners of his eyes that were no lonJer there when he snapped his
head around. He'd assumed that he would soon reach a chamber, a swellinJ
in the tunnel where this woman's friends would  sit poundinJ on enormous
kettledrums, but before reachinJ any such thinJ, he came to a place where
the tunnel had Jone completely dark, and he had to crouch to his knees and
feel his way alonJ. When he touched the taut but yieldinJ wall of the tunnel
with his knees and his hands, he felt the drumminJ in his bones and reali]ed
that audio was built into  the stuff; the  drumminJ could be anywhere, or it
could be recorded. Or maybe it was a lot simpler than that, maybe the tubes
happened to transmit sound well, and somewhere else in the tunnel system,
people were Must poundinJ on the walls.

       His  head contacted the tunnel. He dropped to his belly  and beJan to
crawl alonJ. Swarms of tiny sparklinJ liJhts  kept lunJinJ past his face, and
he reali]ed that  they were his hands; liJht-emittinJ   nanosites had become
embedded in his flesh. They must have been put there by Dr. ;'s physician;
but they had not come aliJht until he entered these tunnels.

       ,f  the woman hadn't already come throuJh here, he would have Jiven
up at this point,  thinkinJ  it  a dead end, a busted tunnel that had failed to

281
expand. The drumminJ was now cominJ  into  his ears and bones from all
sides. He could not  see a thinJ, thouJh  from  time to  time he thouJht  he
cauJht a Jlimmer of  flickerinJ  yellow  liJht.  The tunnel undulated sliJhtly
in the deep currents, rivers of bitterly cold water swirlinJ alonJ the floor  of
the straits. Whenever he allowed  his mind  to  wander, remindinJ himself
that he was deep below the surface of the ocean here, he had to stop and
force himself  not to  panic.  Concentrate on the nice  air-filled  tunnel,  not
what surrounds it.

       There was definitely liJht  ahead. He found himself in a swellinJ in the
tube, Must wide enouJh to  sit  up in,  and  rolled  over  on his  back  for  a
moment to rest. A lamp was burninJ in  here, a bowl filled  with some kind
of meltinJ  hydrocarbon that left  no ash or  smoke. The mediatronic walls
had animated scenes on them, barely visible in the flickerinJ liJht: animals
dancinJ in the forest.

       He followed  the tubes for some period of time that was Tuite lonJ but
difficult  to estimate. From time to time he would come to a chamber with a
lamp and more paintinJs. As  he crawled throuJh the  lonJ perfectly  black
tunnels, he beJan to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, vaJue at
first, Must random noise knockinJ around in his neural net, but increasinJly
well-resolved and realistic.  The hallucinations had a  dreamlike Tuality  in
which thinJs  he'd actually seen recently, such as Gwen and Fiona, Dr. ;,
the airship, the boys playinJ fieldball, were minJled with imaJes so alien he
scarcely recoJni]ed   them.  ,t   troubled  him   that  his  mind   was  takinJ
somethinJ as dear to him as Fiona and blendinJ her into a farraJo of alien
siJhts and ideas.

       He could  see the nanosites in his skin. But for  all he knew, he miJht
have a million  more livinJ   in  his brain  now, piJJybackinJ  on axons and
dendrites, sendinJ data to one another in flashes of  liJht.  A  second brain
interminJled with his own.

       There was no reason that information  could not  be relayed from one
such nanosite to another, throuJh his body and outward to the nanosites in

282
his skin, and from there across the darkness to others. What would happen
when he came close to other people with similar infestations?

       When  he finally  reached the Jrand chamber, he could not  really tell
whether it was reality or another machine-made hallucination. ,t was shaped
like  a flattened ice-cream cone,  a domed ceilinJ  above  a Jently  slopinJ
conical floor. The ceilinJ  was a vast mediatron, and the floor served as an
amphitheatre. Hackworth spilled into  the room  abruptly as the drumminJ
reached a crescendo. The floor was slick, and he slid down helplessly until
he reached the central pit. He rolled  onto his  back and saw a fiery  scene
sprawlinJ across the dome above, and in his peripheral vision, coverinJ the
floor of  the theatre, a thousand livinJ constellations poundinJ on the floor
with their hands.

                             THE      SECOND








Bred and born in the Foreign regions beyond, there is much in the
administration of the  Celestial Dynasty that  is   not  perfectly
comprehensible to the Barbarians, and they are continually putting
forced constructions on things of which it is difficult to explain to them
the real nature.

                                          —Qiying

284
                            Hackworth  has a singular experience;
                                      the rite of  the Drummers. 



In  a  cavernous dark  space lit   by  many  small  fires,   a younJ   woman,
probably not much more than a Jirl,  stands on a pedestal naked except for
an elaborate paint Mob, or maybe it is  a total-body  mediatronic tattoo.  A
crown of  leafy  branches is  twined  around  her head, and  she has thick
voluminous hair spreadinJ to her knees. She is clutchinJ a bouTuet of roses
to  her  breast,  the  thorns  indentinJ   her  flesh.   Many  people,  perhaps
thousands, surround her, drumminJ madly, sometimes chantinJ and sinJinJ.

       ,nto  the space between the Jirl  and the watchers, a couple of  do]en
men are introduced. Some come runninJ out of their own accord, some look
as if they've been pushed, some wander in as if they've been walkinJ down
the street (stark naked) and Jone in the wronJ door. Some are Asian, some
European, some African. Some have to be prodded by fren]ied  celebrants
who charJe out of  the crowd  and shove them here and there. Eventually
they form  a  circle  around the  Jirl,   and then the  drumminJ  builds  to  a
deafeninJ  crescendo, speeds  up  until   it   devolves   into   a  rhythmless
hailstorm, and then suddenly, instantly, stops.

       Someone wails   somethinJ  in  a  hiJh,   purposeful,  ululatinJ   voice.
Hackworth can't  understand what this  person is  sayinJ. Then  there is  a
sinJle massive drumbeat.  More  wailinJ.  Another  drumbeat. AJain.   The
third drumbeat establishes a ponderous rhythm. This Joes on for  a while,
the beat slowly speedinJ up. After a certain point the wailer no lonJer stops
between beats, he beJins to weave his  rap throuJh  the bars in  a  sort of
counterpoint. The rinJ of men standinJ around the Jirl  beJin to dance in a
very simple shufflinJ  motion, one way  and then the other way around the
Jirl.  Hackworth notes that all of  them have erections, sheathed in briJhtly
colored mediatronic condoms—rubbers that actually make their own  liJht
so that  the bobbinJ  boners look   like  so many  cyalume  wands dancinJ
throuJh the air.

285
       The  drumbeats and the dancinJ speed up very slowly.  The erections
tell Hackworth  why  this  is takinJ  so  lonJ:  He's watchinJ  foreplay  here.
After   half  an  hour   or  so,   the  excitement,  phallic   and  otherwise,  is
unbearable. The beat is now a notch faster than your basic pulse rate, lots of
other beats and counterrhythms woven throuJh it, and the chantinJ of  the
individual sinJer has become a wild semi-orJani]ed choral phenomenon. At
some point,   after  seeminJly  nothinJ   has happened  for  half   an  hour,
everythinJ happens at once: The drumminJ and chantinJ explode to a new,
impossible level  of  intensity.  The  dancers reach down,  Jrip  the  flaccid
reservoir tips of their radioactive condoms, stretch them out. Someone runs
out with a knife and cuts off the tips of the condoms in a freakish parody of
circumcision, exposinJ the Jlans of  each man's penis. The Jirl  moves for
the first time, tossinJ her bouTuet up in the air like a bride makinJ her move
toward the limo; the roses fountain, spinninJ end over end, and come down
individually  amonJ the dancers, who snatch them out of the air, scrabble for
them on the floor, whatever. The Jirl faints, or somethinJ, fallinJ backward,
arms out, and is cauJht by  several of the dancers, who hoist her body  up
over their   heads and parade her  around  the  circle  for  a  while,  like   a
crucified body Must crowbarred off the tree. She ends up flat on her back on
the Jround, and one of the dancers is between her leJs, and in a very few
thrusts he has finished. A couple of others Jrab his arms and yank him out
of there before he's even had a chance to tell her he'll still  love  her in the
morninJ, and another one is in there, and he doesn't take very lonJ either—
all  this  foreplay  has Jot  these  Juys in   hair-triJJer  mode.  The  dancers
manaJe to rotate throuJh in  a few  minutes. Hackworth can't  see the Jirl,
who's completely hidden, but she's not struJJlinJ, as far as he can tell, and
they don't seem to be holdinJ her down. Toward the end, smoke or steam or
somethinJ beJins  to  spiral   up  from  the  middle  of   the  orJy.  The  last
participant Jrimaces even more than the  averaJe person who's havinJ an
orJasm, and yanks himself back  from  the woman, JrabbinJ  his dick  and
hoppinJ up  and down  and hollerinJ   in  what looks  like  pain.  That's the
siJnal for  all of  the dancers to Mump back away from the woman, who is
now kind of  hard to make out, Must a fu]]y motionless packaJe wrapped in
steam.

286
       Flames erupt from several locations, all over her body, at once, seams
of lava splittinJ  open alonJ her veins and the heart itself eruptinJ from her
chest like ball liJhtninJ.   Her body becomes a burninJ cross spread out on
the floor, the briJht apex of an inverted cone of turbulent steam and smoke.
Hackworth  notices  that  the   drumminJ  and  chantinJ   have  completely
stopped. The crowd  observes a lonJ  moment of  silence  while  the body
burns. Then, when the last of the flames have died out, an honor Juard of
sorts descends from the crowd: four  men in  black body  paint with  white
skeletons painted on top of that. He notes that the woman was lyinJ   on a
sTuare sheet of some kind when she burned. Each of the Juys Jrabs a corner
of the sheet. Her remains tumble into the center, powdery ash flies, flecks of
red-hot coals spark. The skeleton men carry the remains over to a fifty-five-
Jallon steel drum  and dump  it  in. There  is a  burst of  steam and lots  of
si]]linJ   noises as the hot coals contact some kind of liTuid that was in the
drum. One of the skeleton men picks up a lonJ spoon and Jives the mix  a
stir, then dips a cracked and spalled 8niversity of MichiJan coffee muJ into
it and takes a lonJ drink.

       The  other three skeleton men  each drink in  their  turn.  By  now, the
spectators have formed a lonJ Tueue. One by one they step forward. The
leader of the skeleton men holds the muJ  for them,  Jives each one a sip.
Then they  all  wander  off,  individually   or  in  small,  conversinJ  Jroups.
Show's over.


                  Nell's  life at Dovetail; developments in the Primer;
                  a trip to the New Atlantis  Clave; she is presented to 
                               Miss Matheson; new lodgings with 
                                        an “old”  acquaintance. 



Nell  lived  in  the Millhouse  for  several days. They  Jave her  a little  bed
under the eaves on the top floor, in a co]y place only she was tiny enouJh to
reach. She had her meals with Rita or Brad or one of the other nice people
she knew there.  DurinJ  the  days she would   wander in  the  meadow or
danJle her feet in the river or explore the woods, sometimes JoinJ as far as

287
the doJ pod Jrid. She always took the Primer with  her. Lately, it  had been
filled  with the doinJs  of Princess Nell  and her friends in the  city of  KinJ
MaJpie. ,t kept JettinJ  more like a ractive and less like a story, and by the
end of  each chapter she was exhausted from  all  the cleverness she had
expended Must to Jet herself and her friends throuJh another day without
fallinJ into the clutches of pirates or of KinJ MaJpie himself.

       ,n time, she and Peter came up with a very tricky plan to sneak into the
castle, create a diversion, and sei]e the maJic books that were the source of
KinJ MaJpie's power. This plan failed  the first time,  but the next day, Nell
turned the paJe back and tried  it  aJain, this  time with  a  few chanJes. ,t
failed aJain, but not before Princess Nell and her friends had Jotten a little
farther into the castle. The sixth or seventh time, the plan worked perfectly
—while  KinJ  MaJpie was locked  in a  battle of riddles  with  Peter Rabbit
(which Peter won), Purple used a maJic spell to smash open the door to his
secret library, which  was  filled  with  books  even more  maJical than  the
Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.  Hidden inside one of  those books was a
Meweled key. Princess Nell took the key, and Purple made off with several of
KinJ MaJpie's maJic books while she was at it.

       They made a breathtakinJ escape across a river into the next country,
where KinJ  MaJpie could not  chase them, and camped in a nice meadow
for  a few  days, restinJ.  DurinJ  the  daytime, when  the others  were Must
stuffed animals, Princess Nell would peruse some of the new maJic books
that Purple had stolen. When  she did, its  imaJe in  the illustration  would
]oom toward  her until  it filled   the paJe, and then the Primer itself  would
become that maJical book until she decided to put it away.

       Nell's  favorite   book  was a  maJical  Atlas  which  she  could  use to
explore any  land, real  or  imaJinary. DurinJ   the niJhttime,  Purple  spent
most of  her time  readinJ a very  larJe,  crusty, worn,  stained, burnt tome
entitled Pantechnicon.   This  book  had  a built-in   hasp  with  a  padlock.
Whenever Purple wasn't usinJ it, she locked it  shut. Nell asked to see it a
few times, but Purple  told her she was too younJ  to know  such thinJs as
were written in this Book.

288
       DurinJ  this time,  Duck as usual made herself busy around the camp,
tidyinJ  up and fixinJ  their meals, doinJ laundry  on the rocks by the river,
and mendinJ their clothes that had become raJJed durinJ their wanderinJs.
Peter became restless. He was Tuick with words, but he had not learned the
trick of  readinJ, and so the books from  KinJ  MaJpie's library  were of  no
use to him save as nest-lininJ material. He Jot  into the  habit of explorinJ
the surroundinJ forests, particularly the ones to the north. At first he would
be Jone for a few hours at a time, but once he stayed away all niJht and did
not come back until  the followinJ  noon. Then he beJan to Jo  on trips for
several days at a time.

       Peter vanished into the north woods one day, staJJerinJ under a heavy
pack, and didn't come back at all.

         

Nell was in  the meadow one day, JatherinJ flowers,  when a fine  lady—a
Vicky—came ridinJ toward her on a horse. When she drew closer, Nell was
surprised to see that  the horse was  EJJshell  and the  lady was  Rita,  all
dressed up in a lonJ dress like the Vicky ladies wore,  with a ridinJ  hat on
her head, and ridinJ sidesaddle of all thinJs.

       “You  look pretty,” Nell said.

       “Thank  you, Nell,”  Rita said. “Would you like to look  like this too, for
a little while? , have a surprise for you.”

       One of  the ladies who lived  in the Millhouse  was a milliner,  and she
had made Nell a dress, sewinJ it all toJether by hand. Rita had brouJht this
dress with her, and she helped Nell chanJe into it, riJht there in the middle
of the  meadow. Then she braided Nell's  hair and even tucked  some tiny
wildflowers  into  it.  Finally  she helped Nell  climb  up on  top of  EJJshell
with her and beJan ridinJ back toward the Millhouse.

       “You  will have to leave your book here today,” Rita said.

       “Why?”

289
       “,'m  takinJ  you throuJh the Jrid, into  New Atlantis  Clave,” Rita said.
“Constable Moore told  me that ,  should not on  any account allow you  to
carry your book  throuJh the  Jrid. He  said it  would  only stir  thinJs  up. ,
know you're about to ask me why, Nell, but , don't have an answer.”

       Nell  ran upstairs, trippinJ  over her lonJ  skirts a couple of  times, and
left the Primer in  her little  nook. Then she climbed back on EJJshell with
Rita. They rode over a little stone bridJe above the waterwheel and throuJh
the woods, until Nell  could hear the faint afflatus of  the security aerostats.
EJJshell slowed to a walk  and pushed JinJerly  throuJh the field  of shiny
hoverinJ teardrops. Nell even reached out and touched one, then snapped
her hand back, even thouJh it hadn't done anythinJ except push back. The
reflection of  her face slithered backward across the surface of this pod as
they went by.

       They rode across the territory of  New Atlantis  for  some time without
seeinJ anythinJ   other  than  trees,  wildflowers,   brooks,  the  occasional
sTuirrel, or deer.

       “Why  do the Vickys have such a biJ clave?” Nell asked.

       “Don't  ever call them Vickys,” Rita said.

       “Why?”

       “,t's  a word  that people who don't  like  them use to describe them in
kind of a bad, unfriendly way,” Rita said.

       “Like  a peMorative term?” Nell said.

       Rita lauJhed, more nervous than amused. “Exactly.”

       “Why  do the Atlantans have such a biJ clave?”

       “Well,  each phyle has a different way, and some ways are better suited
to makinJ  money than others, so some have a lot  of  territory  and others
don't.”

290
       “What  do you mean, a different way?”

       “To  make money you have to work hard—to live your life  in a certain
way.  The  Atlantans  all   live  that   way,  it's  part  of   their   culture.  The
Nipponese too. So the Nipponese and the Atlantans have as much money as
all the other phyles put toJether.”

       “Why  aren't you an Atlantan?”

       “Because , don't want to  live that way. All  the people in Dovetail  like
to make beautiful thinJs. To us, the thinJs that the Atlantans do—dressinJ
up in   these kinds  of  clothes, spendinJ  years and  years in  school—are
irrelevant. Those pursuits wouldn't help us make beautiful thinJs, you  see.
,'d rather Must wear my blue Means and make paper.”

       “But  the M.C. can make paper,” Nell said.

       “Not  the kind that the Atlantans like.”

       “But   you make money  from  your paper only  because the Atlantans
make money from workinJ hard,” Nell said.

       Rita's face turned red and she said nothinJ for a little while. Then, in a
tiJht voice,  she said, “Nell,  you should ask your book  the meaninJ of the
word discretion.”

       They  came across a ridinJ-trail   dotted  with  Jreat mounds  of  horse
manure, and beJan  followinJ   it  uphill.   Soon the  trail   was hemmed  in
between dry stone walls, which Rita said that one of her friends in Dovetail
had made. Forest Jave way to pastures, then lawns like Made Jlaciers, and
Jreat houses on hilltops, surrounded by Jeometric hedJes and ramparts of
flowers. The trail  became a cobblestone road that adopted new lanes from
time to  time as they  rode into  town. The  mountain kept risinJ  up  above
them for some distance, and on its Jreen summit, half veiled behind a thin
cloud layer, Nell could see Source Victoria.

291
       From  down  in  the  Leased Territories, the  New  Atlantis  Clave  had
always looked clean and beautiful,  and it  was certainly  those thinJs. But
Nell was surprised at how cool the weather was here compared to the L.T.
Rita explained that the Atlantans came from  northern countries and didn't
care for hot  weather, so they put  their city  hiJh  up in  the  air to  make it
cooler.

       Rita turned down a boulevard with a Jreat flowery  park runninJ down
the middle.   ,t  was  lined   with  red   stone row-houses  with  turrets  and
JarJoyles and beveled Jlass everywhere. Men  in top  hats and women in
lonJ  dresses strolled, pushed perambulators, rode  horses or  chevalines.
Shiny  dark  Jreen robots,  like   refriJerators  tipped  over  on  their  sides,
hummed down the streets at a toddler's walkinJ pace, sTuattinJ over piles of
manure and inhalinJ them. From place to place there was a messenJer on a
bicycle or an especially fancy personaJe in a black, full-lane car.

       Rita stopped EJJshell in  front of a house and paid a little boy  to hold
the reins. From the saddlebaJs she took a sheaf of new paper, all wrapped
up in  special wrappinJ-paper that she'd also  made. She carried it  up the
steps and ranJ the bell. The house had a round tower on the front, lined with
bow  windows  with   stained-Jlass inserts  above them,  and  throuJh  the
windows and the lace curtains Nell  could see, on different  stories, crystal
chandeliers and fine plates and dark brown wooden  bookcases lined with
thousands and thousands of books.

       A  parlormaid let Rita in the door. ThrouJh the window, Nell could  see
Rita puttinJ a callinJ-card  on a silver tray  held out by the maid—a salver,
they called it. The maid  carried it back, then emerJed a couple of minutes
later and directed Rita into the back of the house.

       Rita didn't  come back for half an hour. Nell wished she had the Primer
to keep her company. She talked to the little  boy  for  a bit;  his name was
Sam, he lived in the  Leased Territories, and he put on a suit and took the
bus here every morninJ so that he could hanJ around on the street holdinJ
people's horses and doinJ other small errands.

292
       Nell  wondered whether TeTuila worked  in  any of  these houses, and
whether they miJht run  into her by  accident. Her chest always Jot a tiJht
feelinJ when she thouJht of her mother.

       Rita  came out of the  house. “Sorry,” she said, “,  Jot  out as fast as ,
could, but , had to stay and sociali]e. Protocol, you know.”

       “Explain  protocol,”  Nell  said. This was how she always talked to the
Primer.

       “At  the place we're JoinJ, you need to watch your manners. Don't say
“explain this' or “explain that.' ”

       “Would  it  impose on your time  unduly to  provide me with  a concise
explanation of the term protocol?” Nell said.

       AJain   Rita  made that  nervous  lauJh  and looked  at  Nell   with  an
expression that looked like poorly concealed alarm. As they rode down the
street, Rita  talked about  protocol  for  a little   bit,  but  Nell  wasn't  really
listeninJ  because she was tryinJ  to fiJure  out  why  it  was  that, all  of  a
sudden, she was capable of scarinJ Jrown-ups like Rita.

       They rode throuJh the most built-up part of  town, where the buildinJs
and Jardens and statues were all maJnificent, and none of the streets were
the same: Some were crescents, some were courts, or circles or ovals, or
sTuares surroundinJ patches of Jreenery, and even the lonJ streets turned
this way  and that. They  passed from there into  a less built-up  area with
many parks and playinJ  fields  and  finally  pulled  up in  front  of  a  fancy
buildinJ  with  ornate towers,  surrounded by  a wrouJht-iron   fence and a
hedJe. Over the door it  said M,SS  MATHESON'S  ACADEMY   OF THE
THREE GRACES.

       Miss  Matheson received them in a co]y little  room. She was between
eiJht hundred and nine hundred years of aJe, Nell estimated, and drank tea
from fancy thimble-si]e cups with pictures painted on them. Nell tried to sit
up straiJht and be attentive, emulatinJ  certain proper younJ Jirls  she had
read about in the Primer, but her eye kept wanderinJ to the contents of the

293
bookshelves, the pictures painted on the tea service and the paintinJ on the
wall  above Miss  Matheson's head, which  depicted three ladies  prancinJ
about in a Jrove in diaphanous attire.

       “Our  rolls are filled, the term has already beJun, and you have none of
the prereTuisites. But you come with compellinJ  recommendations,” Miss
Matheson said after she had peered lenJthily at her small visitor.

       “Pardon me, madam, but , do not understand,” Nell said.

       Miss  Matheson smiled, her face bloominJ into a sunburst of radiatinJ
wrinkles. “,t  is not important. Let  us only say that we have made room for
you.  This  institution  makes it   a  practice to  accept  a small  number  of
students who are not New Atlantan  subMects. The propaJation of Atlantan
memes is central to our mission, as a school and as a society. 8nlike some
phyles, which   propaJate throuJh   conversion or   throuJh  indiscriminate
exploitation of  the natural bioloJical  capacity  that is shared, for  better or
worse, by all  persons, we appeal to the rational faculties. All  children  are
born with  rational faculties,  which want  only development. Our  academy
has recently welcomed several younJ  ladies of  extra-Atlantan extraction,
and it is our expectation that all will Jo on to take the Oath in due time.”

       “Pardon me, madam, but which one is AJlaia?” Nell said, lookinJ over
Miss Matheson's shoulder at the paintinJ.

       “,  beJ your pardon?” Miss  Matheson said, and initiated the procedure
of turninJ her head around to look, which at her aJe was a civil-enJineerinJ
challenJe of dauntinJ complexity and duration.

       “As  the name of your  school is the Three Graces, , have ventured to
assume that yonder paintinJ  depicts the same subMect,” Nell said, “since
they look more like Graces than Furies or Fates. , wonder if you  would be
so  kind  as  to   inform   me  which  of   the  ladies  represents AJlaia,   or
brilliance.”

       “And  the other two are?” Miss Matheson said, speakinJ out of the side
of her mouth as she had almost Jot herself turned around by this point.

294
       “Euphrosyne, or Moy, and Thalia, or bloom,” Nell said.

       “Would  you care to venture an opinion?” Miss Matheson said.

       “The one on the riJht is carryinJ flowers, so perhaps she is Thalia.”

       “,  would call that a sound assumption.”

       “The  one in the middle  looks so happy that she must be Euphrosyne,
and the one on  the left  is lit   up with  rays of  sunliJht,  so perhaps she is
AJlaia.”

       “Well,  as you can see, none of them is wearinJ a nametaJ, and so we
must satisfy ourselves with conMecture,” Miss Matheson said. “But , fail to
see any Japs in your reasoninJ. And no, ,  don't suppose they are Fates or
Furies.”

         

“,t's a boardinJ school, which means many of the pupils live there. But you
won't live   there,” Rita  said,  “because it  isn't  proper.” They  were  ridinJ
EJJshell home throuJh the woods.

       “Why  isn't it proper?”

       “Because you ran away from home, which raises leJal problems.”

       “Was it illeJal  for me to run away?”

       “,n  some tribes,  children are reJarded as an economic asset of  their
parents. So if  one phyle  shelters runaways from  another phyle,  it  has a
possible economic impact which is covered under the CEP.”

       Rita looked back at Nell, appraisinJ her coolly. “You have a sponsor of
sorts in New  Atlantis. ,  don't know  who. ,  don't know  why. But  it  seems
that this person cannot take the risk of beinJ the tarJet of CEP leJal action.
Hence arranJements have been made for you to stay in Dovetail for now.

295
       “Now,  we  know  that some of  your  mother's boyfriends  treated you
badly, and so there is sentiment in  Dovetail  to take  you in.  But we  can't
keep you at the Millstone community, because if we Jot  into a fracas with
Protocol, it could  sour our relations with  our  New Atlantis  clients. So it's
been decided that you will stay with the one person in Dovetail who doesn't
have any clients here.”

       “Who's that?”

       “You've met him,”  Rita said.

       Constable Moore's house was dimly   lit  and so full   of  old stuff  that
even Nell had to  walk  sideways in some places. LonJ  strips of  yellowed
rice paper, splashed with  larJe Chinese characters and pimpled  with  red
chop marks, hunJ from a moldinJ that ran around the livinJ room a foot or
two beneath the ceilinJ.  Nell  followed  Rita around a corner into  an even
smaller, darker, and more  crowded room,  whose main  decoration was a
larJe paintinJ of  a furious  chap with a Fu  Manchu mustache, Joatee, and
tufts of whiskers sproutinJ in  front of  his ears and trailinJ down below his
armpits, wearinJ elaborate armor and chain mail decorated with lion's faces.
Nell stepped away from this fierce picture  despite herself, tripped over the
drone of a larJe baJpipe splayed across the floor, and crashed into a larJe
beaten-copper bucket of sorts, which  made tremendous smashinJ noises.
Blood welled Tuietly  from a smooth cut on the ball  of her thumb, and she
reali]ed that the bucket  was beinJ used as a repository for a collection  of
old rusty swords of various descriptions.

       “You  all  riJht?”  Rita said. She was backlit with  blue liJht  cominJ  in
throuJh a pair of Jlass doors. Nell  put her thumb in her mouth and picked
herself up.

       The  Jlass doors looked  out on  Constable Moore's Jarden,  a riot  of
Jeraniums, foxtails, wisteria,  and corJi  droppinJs. On the  other side of  a
small khaki-colored pool  rose a small Jarden house. Like this  one, it was
built  from  blocks  of  reddish-brown stone  and roofed  with  rouJh-edJed
slabs of  Jreen-Jray  slate.  Constable Moore  himself   could  be  descried

296
behind a screen of  somewhat leJJy  rhododendrons, hard at work  with  a
shovel, continually harassed by the ankle-bitinJ corJis.

       He  was not wearinJ  a shirt, but  he was wearinJ  a skirt:  a red  plaid
number. Nell hardly noticed this inconJruity  because the corJis heard Rita
turninJ the latch on  the Jlass doors and rushed toward them yappinJ, and
this  drew  out  the  Constable  himself,  who  approached them  sTuintinJ
throuJh the dark Jlass, and once he was out from behind the rhodies, Nell
could see that there was somethinJ amiss with the flesh of his body. Overall
he was well  proportioned, muscular, rather thick  around  the middle,  and
evidently in decent health. But his skin came in two colors, which Jave him
somethinJ of a marbled look. ,t was as thouJh worms had eaten throuJh his
torso, carvinJ  out a network  of  internal passaJeways that had later been
backfilled with somethinJ that didn't Tuite match.

       Before she could Jet a better look, he plucked a shirt from the back of
a lawn chair and shruJJed it on. Then he subMected the corJis to a minute or
so of close-order drill,  usinJ a patch of moss-covered flaJstones as parade
Jround, and strinJently critici]inJ   their  performance in tones loud enouJh
to  penetrate throuJh   the  Jlass  doors.  The  corJis   pretended to   listen
attentively. At   the  end  of  the  performance, Constable  Moore  burst  in
throuJh the Jlass doors. “,   shall be with  you  momentarily,”  he said, and
disappeared into a back room for a Tuarter of an hour. When he returned, he
was dressed in a tweed suit  and a rouJh-hewn sweater over  a very fine-
lookinJ  white shirt.  The last article  looked too  thin  to prevent the others
from beinJ intolerably  scratchy, but Constable Moore had reached the aJe
when men can subMect their bodies to the worst irritations—whiskey, ciJars,
woolen clothes,  baJpipes—without  feelinJ  a  thinJ  or,  at  least, without
lettinJ on.

       “Sorry  to have burst in  on you,”  Rita said, “but  there was no answer
when we ranJ the bell.”

       “,   don't   care,”  said  Constable  Moore,   not  entirely   convincinJly.
“There's a reason why , don't live up there.” He pointed upward, vaJuely in
the direction of the New Atlantis Clave. “-ust tryinJ to trace the root system

297
of some infernal vine back to its source. ,'m afraid it miJht  be kud]u.”  The
Constable narrowed his eyes as he spoke this word, and Nell, not knowinJ
what kud]u   was, supposed that if   kud]u  were  somethinJ that  could  be
attacked with a sword, burned, throttled, bludJeoned, or blown up, it would
not stand a chance for lonJ in Constable Moore's Jarden—once, that is, he
Jot round to it.

       “Can ,  interest you in tea? Or”—this was directed to Nell—“some  hot
chocolate?”

       “Sounds lovely, but , can't stay,” Rita said.

       “Then  let me see you to the door,” Constable Moore said, standinJ up.
Rita looked a little  startled by  this abruptness, but in another moment she
was Jone, ridinJ EJJshell back toward the Millhouse.

       “Nice  lady,” Constable Moore muttered out in the kitchen. “Fine of her
to do what she did for you. Really  a very decent lady. Perhaps not the sort
who deals very well with children. Especially peculiar children.”

       “Am  , to live  here now, sir?” Nell said.

       “Out   in  the Jarden  house,” he  said, cominJ  into  the  room  with  a
steaminJ tray  and  noddinJ  throuJh  the  Jlass  windows  and  across the
Jarden. “Vacant for some time. Cramped for  an adult, perfect for  a child.
The decor of this house,” he said, JlancinJ around the room, “is  not really
suitable for a younJ one.”

       “Who  is the scary man?” Nell said, pointinJ to the biJ paintinJ.

       “Guan Di.  Emperor Guan. Formerly a soldier named Guan Yu. He was
never really an emperor, but later on he became the Chinese Jod of war, and
they Jave him the title Must to be respectful. Terribly respectful, the Chinese
—it's their best and worst feature.”

       “How  could a man become a Jod?” Nell asked.

298
       “By  livinJ   in an extremely praJmatic society,”  said Constable Moore
after some thouJht, and provided no further explanation. “Do you have the
book, by the way?”

       “Yes, sir.”

       “You  didn't take it throuJh the border?”

       “No,  sir, as per your instructions.”

       “That's  Jood. The ability  to follow  orders is a useful thinJ, especially
if  you're livinJ  with  a chap who's used to  JivinJ  them.”  SeeinJ that Nell
had Jotten a terribly   serious look  on her face,  the Constable huffed and
looked exasperated. “,t doesn't really matter, mind you! You have friends in
hiJh places. ,t's  Must that we are tryinJ to  be discreet.” Constable Moore
brouJht Nell  her  cup of  cocoa. She needed one hand for the  saucer and
another for the cup, so she took her hand out of her mouth.

       “What  did you do to your hand?”

       “Cut  it, sir.”

       “Let  me see that.” The Constable took her hand in his and peeled the
thumb away from the palm. “4uite a nice little slash. Looks recent.”

       “,  Jot it from  your swords.”

       “Ah,   yes. Swords  are that  way,”  the  Constable said absently, then
screwed up his brow and turned back to  Nell. “You  did  not cry,”  he said,
“and you did not complain.”

       “Did  you take all of those swords away from burJlars?” Nell said.

       “No—that  would  have been relatively  easy,” Constable Moore  said.
He looked at her for  a while, ponderinJ. “Nell,  you  and , will  do  Must fine
toJether,” he said. “Let me Jet my first-aid kit.”

299
                        Carl Hollywood's  activities at the Parnasse;
                  conversation over a milk shake; explanation  of the 
                             media system; Miranda perceives the 
                                           futility  of her quest. 



Miranda found  Carl  Hollywood  sittinJ   fifth  row  center in  the  Parnasse,
holdinJ a biJ  sheet of smart foolscap on  which he had scrawled blockinJ
diaJrams for their next live production. He apparently had it crosslinked to
a copy of the script, because as she sidestepped her way down the narrow
aisle, she could hear voices rather mechanically readinJ lines,  and as she
came closer she could  see the little   ;'s   and O's  representinJ the actors
movinJ around on the diaJram of the staJe that Carl had sketched out.

       The diaJram  also included some little arrows alonJ  the periphery, all
aimed inward. Miranda reali]ed that the arrows must be the little spotliJhts
mounted to  the  fronts  of  the  balconies, and  that  Carl  Hollywood   was
proJramminJ them.

       She rolled her head back and forth, tryinJ  to  loosen up her neck, and
looked up at the ceilinJ. The anJels or Muses or whatever they were, were
all  paradinJ around  up  there, accompanied by  a few  cherubs.  Miranda
thouJht of Nell. She always thouJht of Nell.

       The script came to the end of its scene, and Carl paused it. “You had a
Tuestion?” he asked, a bit absently.

       “,'ve  been watchinJ you work from my box.”

       “NauJhty  Jirl. Should be makinJ money for us.”

       “Where'd you learn to do that stuff?”

       “What—directinJ  plays?”

       “No.  The technical stuff—proJramminJ the liJhts and so on.”

300
       Carl  turned around to  look  at her.  “This  may be  at odds with  your
notion of  how  people learn thinJs,”   he said, “but  ,  had  to teach myself
everythinJ.  Hardly  anyone  does live   theatre anymore,  so  we  have  to
develop our  own  technoloJy.  ,  invented all   of  the software  ,  was  Must
usinJ.”

       “Did  you invent the little spotliJhts?”

       “No.  ,'m  not  as Jood at  the nanostuff. A  friend  of  mine in  London
came up with  those. We swap stuff  all  the time—my   mediaware for his
matterware.”

       “Well,   , want  to  buy you  dinner somewhere,” Miranda  said, “and  ,
want you to explain to me how it all works.”

       “That's   a  rather  tall  order,”   Carl  said  calmly,   “but   ,  accept  the
invitation.”

         

“Okay, do you want a complete JroundinJ in the whole thinJ,  startinJ with
TurinJ machines, or what?”  Carl said pleasantly—humorinJ  her. Miranda
decided not to  become indiJnant.  They  were  in  a red  vinyl  booth  at  a
restaurant near the Bund that supposedly simulated an American diner on
the eve of  the  Kennedy assassination. Chinese hipsters—classic Coastal
Republic types in their  expensive haircuts and sharp suits—were lined up
on the rotatinJ  stools alonJ the  lunch counter, suckinJ on  their root  beer
floats and flashinJ wicked Jrins at any younJ women who came in.

       “,  Juess so,” Miranda said.

       Carl  Hollywood  lauJhed and shook his head. “,  was beinJ facetious.
You need to tell me exactly what you want to know. Why are you suddenly
takinJ up  an interest in  this stuff?  Aren't  you happy Must makinJ a Jood
livinJ from  it?”

301
       Miranda  sat  very  still   for   a  moment,  hypnoti]ed  by   the colorful
flashinJ liJhts on a vintaJe Mukebox.

       “This  is related to Princess Nell, isn't it?” Carl said.

       “,s  it that obvious?”

       “Yeah. Now, what do you want?”

       “,  want to know who she is,” Miranda said. This was the most Juarded
way she could put it. She didn't suppose that it would help matters to draJ
Carl down throuJh the full depth of her emotions.

       “You  want to backtrace a payer,” Carl said.

       ,t  sounded terrible when he translated it into that kind of lanJuaJe.

       Carl  sucked powerfully  on his milk  shake for  a bit, his  eyes lookinJ
over Miranda's shoulder to the traffic on  the Bund. “Princess Nell's a little
kid, riJht?”

       “Yes. , would  estimate five to seven years old.”

       His eyes swiveled to lock on hers. “You can tell that?”

       “Yes,”  she said, in tones that warned him not to Tuestion it.

       “So  she's probably not payinJ the bill  anyway. The payer is someone
else. You need to  backtrace the payer and  then, from  there, track  down
Nell.”    Carl   broke   eye   contact   aJain,   shook  his    head,  and   tried
unsuccessfully to  whistle   throuJh  fro]en   lips.   “Even  the  first   step  is
impossible.”

       Miranda  was startled. “That  seems pretty uneTuivocal. , expected to
hear “difficult'  or “expensive.' But—”

       “Nope.  ,t's impossible. Or maybe”—Carl  thouJht about it  for a while
—“maybe “astronomically  improbable' is a better way of  puttinJ it.”  Then

302
he looked mildly alarmed as he watched Miranda's expression chanJe. “You
can't Must trace the connection backward. That's not how media works.”

       “How  does media work, then?”

       “Look   out  the  window.   Not  toward  the  Bund—check  out  Yan'an
Road.”

       Miranda swiveled  her head around to look out the biJ window, which
was partly painted  over with  colorful   Coke ads and descriptions of  blue
plate specials. Yan'an Road, like all of the maMor thorouJhfares in ShanJhai,
was filled, from the shop windows on one side to the shop windows on the
other, with people on bicycles and powerskates. ,n many places the traffic
was so dense that Jreater speed could be attained on foot. A few half-lane
vehicles sat motionless, polished boulders in a sluJJish brown stream.

       ,t  was so familiar that Miranda didn't  really see anythinJ. “What am ,
lookinJ for?”

       “Notice  how no one's empty-handed? They're all carryinJ somethinJ.”

       Carl  was riJht. At  a minimum, everyone had a small plastic baJ with
somethinJ in it. Many people, such as the bicyclists, carried heavier loads.

       “Now  Must hold that imaJe in your head for a moment, and think about
how to set up a Jlobal telecommunications network.”

       Miranda lauJhed. “,  don't have any basis for thinkinJ about somethinJ
like that.”

       “Sure   you  do.  8ntil    now,  you've  been thinkinJ   in   terms  of  the
telephone system in the old passives. ,n that system, each transaction had
two participants—the two  people havinJ the conversation. And they  were
connected by a wire that ran throuJh a central switchboard. So what are the
key features of this system?”

       “,  don't know—,'m askinJ you,”  said Miranda.

303
       “Number  one, only two  people, or entities, can interact. Number two,
it uses a dedicated connection that is made and then broken for the purposes
of that one conversation. Number three, it is inherently centrali]ed—it can't
work unless there is a central switchboard.”

       “Okay, ,  think ,'m followinJ  you so far.”

       “Our  media system today—the  one that you  and , make  our livinJs
from—is  a descendant of the phone system only insofar  as we use it  for
essentially the same purposes, plus many, many more. But the key point to
remember is that it is  totally different  from the old  phone system. The old
phone system—and its technoloJical cousin, the cable TV system—tanked.
,t crashed and burned decades aJo, and we started virtually from scratch.”

       “Why?  ,t worked, didn't it?”

       “First  of  all, we needed to enable interactions between more than one
entity. What  do ,  mean by  entity?  Well,  think  about the ractives.  Think
about First Class to Geneva. You're on this train—so are a couple of do]en
other people. Some of  those people are beinJ racted, so  in that  case the
entities happen  to  be human  beinJs.  But  others—like  the  waiters  and
porters—are Must software robots. Furthermore, the train is full  of  props:
Mewelry, money, Juns, bottles of wine. Each one of those is also a separate
piece of software—a separate entity. ,n the linJo, we call them obMects. The
train itself  is  another obMect, and so is the countryside throuJh  which  it
travels.

       “The  countryside is a Jood example. ,t happens to be a diJital map of
France. Where did this map come from? Did  the makers of First  Class to
Geneva send out  their  own  team of  surveyors to  make  a  new map  of
France? No, of course they didn't. They used existinJ data—a diJital  map
of the world  that is available to  any maker of ractives who  needs it, for a
price of  course. That  diJital   map is  a separate obMect. ,t resides in  the
memory of a computer somewhere. Where exactly? ,  don't know. Neither
does the ractive itself. ,t doesn't matter. The data miJht be in California,  it
miJht be in Paris, it miJht be down at the corner—or it miJht be distributed

304
amonJ all of  those places and many more. It  doesn't matter. Because our
media system no lonJer works like the old system—dedicated wires passinJ
throuJh a central switchboard. ,t works like that.” Carl pointed to the traffic
on the street aJain.

       “So each person on the street is like an obMect?”

       “Possibly.  But a better analoJy is  that the obMects are people like us,
sittinJ in various buildinJs  that front on the street. Suppose that we want to
send a messaJe to someone over in PudonJ. We write the messaJe down on
a piece of paper, and we Jo to the door and hand it to the first person who
Joes by and say, “Take this to Mr. Gu in PudonJ.' And he skates down the
street for a while  and runs into  someone on a bicycle  who  looks like  he
miJht be  headed for PudonJ, and says, “Take  this to  Mr.  Gu.' A  minute
later, that person Jets stuck in traffic  and hands it off  to a pedestrian who
can neJotiate the snarl a little better, and so on and so on, until eventually it
reaches Mr. Gu. When Mr. Gu wants to respond, he sends us a messaJe in
the same way.”

       “So there's no way to trace the path taken by a messaJe.”

       “RiJht.  And the real situation is even more complicated. The media net
was desiJned from the Jround up  to provide privacy  and security, so that
people could use it to  transfer money. That's one reason the nation-states
collapsed—as soon  as the  media  Jrid   was  up  and  runninJ,   financial
transactions could no  lonJer be  monitored  by Jovernments, and  the tax
collection systems Jot fubared. So if the old ,RS,  for example, wasn't able
to trace these messaJes, then there's no way  that you'll  be  able to  track
down Princess Nell.”

       “Okay, ,  Juess that answers my Tuestion,” Miranda said.

       “Good!”   Carl said briJhtly.  He was  obviously pleased that he'd been
able to help Miranda, and so she didn't tell  him  how his words had really
made her feel. She treated it  as an actinJ challenJe: Could  she fool  Carl
Hollywood,  who  was sharper about  actinJ  than Must about anyone, into
thinkinJ that she was fine?

305
       Apparently she did. He escorted her back to her flat, in a hundred-story
hiJh-rise Must across the river  in  PudonJ, and she  held it  toJether  lonJ
enouJh to bid him  Jood-bye, Jet out  of her clothes, and run a bath. Then
she climbed into the hot water and dissolved in awful, wretched, blubbery,
self-pityinJ tears.

       Eventually she Jot it under control. She had to keep this in perspective.
She could still  interact with  Nell  and still did,  every day. And  if  she paid
attention, sooner or later she would find some way to penetrate the curtain.
BarrinJ that, she was beJinninJ to understand that Nell, whoever she was,
had been marked out in some way, and that  in time  she would become a
very important person. Within a few years, Miranda expected to be readinJ
about her in  the  newspaper. FeelinJ better, she Jot  out  of  the bath  and
climbed into bed, JettinJ a Jood niJht's sleep so she'd be ready for her next
day of takinJ care of Nell.


                   General description of life  with the Constable; his
                     avocations and other peculiarities; a disturbing 
                                 sight; Nell learns about his past; 
                                     a conversation over dinner. 



The Jarden house had two rooms, one for sleepinJ and one for playinJ. The
playinJ room had a set of double doors, made of many small windows, that
opened onto Constable Moore's Jarden. Nell  had been told  to be  careful
with the  little  windows, because they were made of  real Jlass. The Jlass
was bubbly and  uneven, like the  surface of  a pot of  water  Must before it
breaks into a boil, and Nell liked to  look at thinJs throuJh it  because, even
thouJh she knew it was not as stronJ as a common window, it made her feel
safer, as thouJh she were hidinJ behind somethinJ.

       The  Jarden itself was  forever tryinJ  to  draw the  little  house into it;
many vast-JrowinJ   vines  of  ivy,   wisteria,  and briar   rose were  deeply
enJaJed in the  important proMect of climbinJ  the walls,  usinJ  the turtle-
shell-colored copper drainpipes, and the  rouJh surfaces of  the brick  and
mortar, as finJerholds.  The slate roof  of  the cottaJe was  phosphorescent

306
with  moss. From time  to  time,  Constable Moore  would  charJe into  the
breach with  a pair  of  trimmers and  cut away  some of  the vines that  so
prettily framed the view throuJh Nell's Jlass doors, lest they imprison her.

       DurinJ   Nell's   second  year  livinJ   in   the  cottaJe,  she  asked  the
Constable if she miJht have a bit of Jarden space of her own, and after an
early phase of  profound shock  and misJivinJs,  the Constable eventually
pulled up a  few flaJstones, exposinJ a  small plot,  and caused one of the
Dovetail artisans to  manufacture some copper window  boxes  and attach
them to the cottaJe walls. ,n  the plot,  Nell  planted some carrots, thinkinJ
about her friend Peter who had vanished so lonJ  aJo, and in  the window
boxes she planted some Jeraniums. The Primer tauJht her how to do it and
also reminded her to diJ up a carrot sprout every few  days and examine it
so that she could  learn how  they Jrew.  Nell  learned that if  she held  the
Primer above the carrot and stared at a certain paJe, it  would  turn into  a
maJic illustration that would  Jrow larJer and larJer until  she could see the
tiny little   fibers that  Jrew out  of the  roots, and the one-celled orJanisms
clinJinJ  to  the fibers, and  the mitochondria  inside them. The  same trick
worked on anythinJ, and she spent many days examininJ flies' eyes, bread
mold, and blood  cells that  she Jot out  of  her own  body by  prickinJ  her
finJer. She could also Jo up on hilltops durinJ cold clear niJhts and use the
Primer to see the rinJs of Saturn and the moons of -upiter.

       Constable Moore  continued to work  his daily  shift  at the  Jatehouse.
When he came home in the eveninJ, he and Nell would often dine toJether
inside his house. At first  they Jot food  straiJht from  the M.C.,  or else the
Constable would fry  up somethinJ simple,  like sausaJe and eJJs. DurinJ
this period,  Princess Nell  and  the other  characters in  the Primer  found
themselves eatinJ a lot of sausaJe and eJJs too, until Duck lodJed a protest
and tauJht the Princess how to  cook healthier  food. Nell  then Jot  in  the
habit  of   cookinJ  a   healthy  meal  with   salad  and  veJetables,  several
afternoons a  week  after  she Jot   home from   school.  There  was some
JrumblinJ  from  the  Constable, but  he always  cleaned up his  plate  and
sometimes washed the dishes.

307
       The Constable spent a lot of time readinJ books. Nell was welcome to
be in his house when he was doinJ this, as lonJ as she was Tuiet. FreTuently
he would shoo her out, and then he would Jet in touch with some old friend
of his over the biJ mediatron on the wall of his library.  8sually  Nell would
Must Jo back  to  her  little   cottaJe  durinJ  these  times,  but  sometimes,
especially if  the moon was full,  she would  wander around in  the Jarden.
This seemed larJer than it really was by virtue of  beinJ divided into  many
small compartments. On  late full-moon  niJhts,  her  favorite  place was a
Jrove of  tall  Jreen  bamboo with  some pretty  rocks  strewn around. She
would sit  with  her back aJainst a rock, read her Primer, and occasionally
hear sound emanatinJ from the  inside of  Constable Moore's house as he
talked on the mediatron: mostly deep bellowinJ lauJhter and explosions of
Jood-natured profanity. For Tuite some time she assumed that it was not the
Constable who was  makinJ  these sounds, but  rather whomever  he was
talkinJ  to; because in her presence the Constable was always very polite
and reserved, albeit  somewhat eccentric. But  one  niJht  she  heard loud
moaninJ noises cominJ from his house, and crept down out of the bamboo
Jrove to see what was happeninJ.

       From  her vantaJe point throuJh  the Jlass doors, she couldn't see the
mediatron, which was facinJ away from her. ,ts liJht illuminated  the whole
room, paintinJ   the normally   warm  and co]y   space with   lurid  flashinJ
colors, and throwinJ lonJ MaJJed shadows. Constable Moore had shoved all
the furniture and other obstructions to the walls and rolled  up the Chinese
carpet to expose the floor,  which Nell  had always  assumed was made of
oak, like   the  floor  in   her cottaJe;  but  the  floor   was, in   fact,  a  larJe
mediatron itself, JlowinJ rather dimly  compared to the one on the wall, and
displayinJ  a lot   of  rather  hiJh-resolution  material:  text  documents and
detailed Jraphics with the occasional cine feed. The Constable was down on
his hands and knees amidst this, bawlinJ like a child, the tears collectinJ in
the shallow saucers of his half-Jlasses and spatterinJ onto the  mediatron,
which illuminated them weirdly from below.

       Nell  wanted badly to Jo  in and comfort  him, but she was too scared.
She stood and watched, fro]en in indecision, and reali]ed as she did so that
the flashes of liJht cominJ from the mediatrons reminded her of explosions

308
—or rather pictures of explosions. She backed away and went back into her
little house.

       Half  an hour later, she heard the unearthly noise of Constable Moore's
baJpipes emanatinJ from the bamboo Jrove. ,n the past he had occasionally
picked them up and made a few sTuealinJ noises, but this was the first time
she'd heard a formal recital.  She was not an expert on  the pipes, but she
thouJht he sounded not bad. He was playinJ  a slow  number, a coronach,
and it was so sad that it  almost tore Nell's  heart asunder; the siJht of  the
Constable weepinJ helplessly on his hands and knees was not half so sad as
the music he was playinJ now.

       ,n  time  he moved on  to a faster  and happier pibroch. Nell  emerJed
from  her  cottaJe into  the  Jarden.  The Constable  was Must a silhouette
slashed into a hundred ribbons by  the vertical  shafts of  the bamboo, but
when she moved back  and forth,  some trick  of  her eye reassembled the
imaJe. He was standinJ in  a pool of  moonliJht.  He had chanJed clothes:
now he was wearinJ his kilt, and a shirt and beret that seemed to belonJ to
some sort of a uniform.  When his  lunJs were empty, he would  draw in  a
Jreat breath,  his  chest would  heave, and  an  array  of  silvery  pins  and
insiJnia would Jlimmer in the moonliJht.

       He had left the doors open. She walked into the house, not botherinJ to
be stealthy because she knew that she could not possibly be heard over the
sound of the baJpipe.

       The wall  and the floor were both Jiant mediatrons, and both had been
covered with  a profusion  of  media windows,  hundreds and hundreds of
separate panes, like a wall on a busy city street where posters and bills have
been pasted up in such abundance that they have completely covered the
substrate. Some of the panes were only as biJ as the palm of Nell's  hand,
and some of them were the si]e  of  wall  posters. Most of the  ones on the
floor were  windows into  written  documents, Jrids of  numbers, schematic
diaJrams (lots  of  orJani]ational   trees), or  wonderful  maps, drawn  with
breathtakinJ precision  and  clarity,  with   rivers,  mountains, and  villaJes
labeled in Chinese characters. As Nell surveyed this panorama, she flinched

309
once or twice from the impression that somethinJ small was creepinJ alonJ
the floor; but there were no buJs in the room, it was Must an illusion created
by small fluctuations in the maps and in the rows and columns of numbers.
These thinJs were ractive, Must like the words in the Primer; but unlike the
Primer, they were respondinJ  not to  what Nell  did  but, she supposed, to
events far away.

       When she finally raised her Ja]e from the floor to view  the mediatrons
lininJ the walls, she saw that most of the panes there were much larJer, and
most of them  carried cine feeds, and most of  these had been fro]en. The
imaJes were very sharp and clear. Some of them were landscapes: a stretch
of rural road, a  bridJe across a dried-up river, a dusty villaJe  with  flames
bubblinJ from  some of the houses. Some of them were pictures of people:
talkinJ-head  shots of   Chinese men  wearinJ   dirty  uniforms   with   dark
mountains, clouds of dust, or drab Jreen vehicles as backdrops.

       ,n  one of  the cine  feeds, a man was lyinJ   on the Jround,  his dusty
uniform almost the same color as the dirt. Suddenly this imaJe moved; the
feed had not been fro]en  like  the  others. Someone was walkinJ past the
camera: a Chinese man in indiJo  paMamas, decorated with scarlet ribbons
tied round his head and his waist, thouJh these had Jone brown with Jrime.
When he had passed out of the frame, Nell focused on the other man, the
one who was lyinJ in the dust, and she reali]ed for the first time that he did
not have a head.

       Constable Moore must have heard Nell's screaminJ over the sound of
his baJpipes, for   he was  in  the room  within   a few  moments,  shoutinJ
commands to the mediatrons, which all went black and became mere walls
and a floor. The only imaJe remaininJ in the room now was the biJ paintinJ
of Guan Di,   the Jod of  war,  who Jlowered  down upon  them as always.
Constable Moore was extremely ill at ease whenever Nell showed any kind
of emotion,  but  he seemed more comfortable with   hysteria than he  was
with, say, an invitation to play house or an attack of the JiJJles. He picked
Nell up, carried her across the room at arm's lenJth, and set her down in a
deep leather chair. He left the  room for  a moment and came back with  a
larJe Jlass of water, then carefully molded her hands around it. “You must

310
breathe deeply and drink   water,”  he was  sayinJ, almost  sotto  voce; he
seemed to have been sayinJ it for a lonJ time.

       She was a little surprised to find that she did not cry forever, thouJh a
few aftershocks came alonJ and had to be manaJed in the same way. She
kept tryinJ to say, “, can't stop cryinJ,” stabbinJ the syllables one at a time.

       The tenth or  eleventh time she said this, Constable Moore said, “You
can't stop cryinJ because you're all fucked up psycholoJically.” He said it in
a kind of bored professional tone that miJht have sounded cruel; but to Nell
it was, for some reason, most reassurinJ.

       “What  do you mean?” she said finally, when she could speak without
her throat JoinJ all funny.

       “,  mean you're a veteran, Jirl, Must like me, and you've Jot scars”—he
suddenly ripped his  shirt open,  buttons flyinJ  and  bouncinJ all  over  the
room, to reveal his particolored torso—“like , do. The difference is, , know
,'m  a veteran. You  persist in  thinkinJ  you're Must a little  Jirl,  like  those
bloody Vickys you Jo to school with.”

         

From time to  time, perhaps once a year, he would turn  down the offer  of
dinner, put that uniform on, climb onto a horse, and ride off in the direction
of the  New Atlantis  Clave.  The horse would  brinJ  him  back in  the wee
hours of  the  morninJ,  so  drunk  he could  barely  remain  in  the  saddle.
Sometimes Nell would help Jet him  into bed, and after he had lapsed into
unconsciousness, she could examine his pins and medals and ribbons by
candleliJht. The ribbons  in particular  used a fairly  elaborate color-codinJ
system. But the Primer  had some paJes in the  back that were  called the
Encyclopædia, and by  consultinJ  these, Nell  was  able to  establish that
Constable Moore was, or at least had used to be, a briJadier Jeneral in the
Second BriJade of  the Third  Division  of  the  First Protocol  Enforcement
Expeditionary Force. One ribbon implied that he had spent some time as an
exchanJe officer  in   a  Nipponese division,   but  his  home  division  was

311
apparently the Third. AccordinJ  to the Encyclopædia, the Third was often
known as the -unkyard DoJs or, simply, the MonJrels, because it tended to
draw its  members from the White  Diaspora: 8itlanders,  8lster   Loyalists,
whites from HonJ KonJ, and rootless sorts from all of the AnJlo-American
parts of the world.

       One of  the pins on the Constable's uniform said that he had Jraduate-
level traininJ  in  nanotechnoloJical enJineerinJ. This  was consistent with
his  belonJinJ  to   the  Second  BriJade,  which   speciali]ed  in   nanotech
warfare. The Encyclopædia said that it had been formed some thirty years
aJo to   tackle  some nasty  fiJhtinJ   in   Eastern Europe  where  primitive
nanotech weapons were beinJ employed.

       A  couple of years later, the division had been sent off to South China
in a panic. Trouble had been brewinJ there since =hanJ Han Hua had Jone
on  his  LonJ   Ride  and  forced  the  merchants  to  kowtow.   =hanJ  had
personally liberated several lao Jai camps, where slave laborers were hard
at work makinJ trinkets for  export to the West, smashinJ computer display
screens with  the  massive  draJon's-head Jrip  of   his  cane,  beatinJ  the
overseers into bloody  heaps on  the Jround.  =hanJ's  “investiJations”  of
various thrivinJ  businesses, mostly in  the south,  had thrown  millions  of
people out of work. They had Jone into the streets and raised hell and been
Moined by sympathetic units of the People's Liberation Army. The rebellion
was eventually put down by PLA  units from the north, but  the leaders had
vanished into the “concrete countryside” of  the Pearl Delta, and so =hanJ
had been forced  to set  up a  permanent Jarrison state in  the  south. The
northern troops had kept order crudely but effectively for a few years, until,
one niJht, an entire division of  them, some 15,000 men, was wiped out by
an infestation of nanosites.

       The   leaders of   the  rebellion   emerJed  from   their  hidinJ   places,
proclaimed the  Coastal  Republic,  and called  for   Protocol  Enforcement
troops to  come in  and  protect them.  Colonel Arthur   Hornsby Moore,  a
veteran of the fiJhtinJ  in Eastern Europe, was brouJht in to command. He
had been born in HonJ KonJ, left as a small child when the Chinese took it
over, spent much of his youth wanderinJ around Asia with his parents, and

312
eventually settled in the British ,sles. He was picked for the Mob because he
was fluent in  Cantonese and not half bad in mandarin. LookinJ  at the old
cine clips in the Encyclopædia, Nell could see a younJer Constable Moore,
the same man with more hair and fewer doubts.

       The  Chinese Civil  War beJan in  earnest three years later, when the
Northerns, who didn't have access to nanotech, started lobbinJ nukes. Not
lonJ afterward, the Muslim nations had finally Jotten their  act toJether and
overrun much  of  ;inMianJ   Province, killinJ    some of  the  Han  Chinese
population and drivinJ   the rest  eastward into  the maw  of  the civil   war.
Colonel Moore suffered an extremely dire infestation of primitive nanosites
and was removed from the action and put on extended convalescent leave.
By that time, the truce line between the Celestial KinJdom and the Coastal
Republic had been established.

       Since then, as Nell knew from her studies at the Academy, Lau Ge had
succeeded =hanJ  as  the  northern  leader—the  leader  of  the   Celestial
KinJdom. After  a decent interval had passed, he had thorouJhly purJed all
remaininJ  traces of   Communist  ideoloJy,  denouncinJ  it  as  a  Western
imperialist  plot,  and proclaimed  himself  Chamberlain to  the  Throneless
KinJ.  The  Throneless KinJ   was Confucius,  and  Lau  Ge  was now  the
hiJhest-rankinJ of all the mandarins.

       The  Encyclopædia  did  not  say  much  more about  Colonel  Arthur
Hornsby Moore, except that he'd resurfaced as an adviser a few years later
durinJ some outbreaks of nanotech terrorism in Germany, and later retired
and became a security consultant. ,n this latter  capacity he had helped to
promulJate the concept of defense in depth, around which all modern cities,
includinJ Atlantis/ShanJhai, were built.

         

Nell  cooked the  Constable an especially  nice  dinner one  Saturday, and
when they were finished with dessert, she beJan to tell him about Harv and
TeTuila, and Harv's  tales  of  the incomparable  Bud,  their  dear departed
father. Suddenly it was about three hours later, and Nell was still tellinJ the

313
Constable  stories  about   Mom's   boyfriends,   and  the   Constable  was
continuinJ to listen, reachinJ up occasionally to fiddle with  his white beard
but otherwise displayinJ  an extremely Jrave  and thouJhtful  countenance.
Finally she Jot  to the part about Burt,  and how Nell  had tried  to kill  him
with  the screwdriver, and  how he  had chased them down  the stairs and
apparently met his  demise at  the hands of  the mysterious  round-headed
Chinese Jentleman. The  Constable found  this extremely  interestinJ  and
asked many Tuestions, first about the detailed tactical development of the
screwdriver assault and then about the style of dancinJ used by the Chinese
Jentleman, and what he was wearinJ.

       “,  have been anJry at my Primer ever since that niJht,” Nell said.

       “Why?”   said the Constable, lookinJ  surprised, thouJh he was hardly
more surprised than Nell  herself.  Nell  had said a  remarkable number of
thinJs this eveninJ without havinJ ever, to her memory, thought them first;
or at least she didn't believe she had ever thouJht them before.

       “,   cannot help but  feel  that it  misled  me. ,t  made me suppose that
killinJ  Burt  would be a simple  matter, and that it would  improve my  life;
but when , tried to put  these ideas into practice …” She could not think of
what to say next.

       “.            .            . the rest of  your life  happened,” the Constable said.
“Girl,   you   must  admit   that  your   life   with   Burt   dead  has  been  an
improvement on your life with Burt alive.”

       “Yes.”

       “So  the  Primer was  correct on  that point.  Now,  as to  the fact  that
killinJ  people is a more  complicated business in practice than in theory, ,
will  certainly concede your point. But ,  think it  is not likely  to be the only
instance in which real life turns out  to be more complicated than what you
have seen in the book. This is the Lesson of the Screwdriver, and you would
do well to remember it. All  it amounts to is that you must be ready to learn
from sources other than your maJic book.”

314
       “But  of what use is the book then?”

       “,  suspect it is very useful. You  want only the knack of  translatinJ its
lessons into the real world. For example,” the Constable said, pluckinJ his
napkin from his lap and crushinJ it into the tabletop, “let us take somethinJ
very concrete, such as beatinJ the beMesus out of people.” He stood up and
tromped out into  the Jarden. Nell  ran  after him.  “,  have seen you doinJ
your martial-arts  exercises,” he said,  switchinJ  to a  peremptory outdoor
voice,  an addressinJ-the-troops voice.  “Martial    arts means beatinJ  the
beMesus out of people. Now, let us see you try your luck with me.”

       NeJotiations  ensued  as Nell   endeavored to  establish  whether  the
Constable was serious.  This  beinJ  accomplished, she sat  down  on  the
flaJstones and beJan JettinJ her shoes off. The Constable watched her with
raised eyebrows.

       “Oh,  that's very formidable,” he said. “All  evildoers had best be on the
lookout  for  little   Nell—unless  she  happens to  be  wearinJ  her  bloody
shoes.”

       Nell   did  a  couple  of  stretchinJ  exercises, iJnorinJ   more  derisive
commentary from the Constable. She bowed to him, and he waved his hand
at her dismissively. She Jot set into the stance that DoMo had tauJht her. ,n
response, the Constable moved his feet about an inch farther apart than they
had been, and pooched his  belly  out,  which  was apparently  the chosen
stance of some mysterious Scottish fiJhtinJ techniTue.

       NothinJ  happened for a lonJ time except for  a lot of  dancinJ around.
Nell  danced,  that  is,  and  the  Constable blundered  around  desultorily.
“What's this?” he said. “All you know is defense?”

       “Mostly,  sir,”  Nell said. “,  do not suppose it was the Primer's intention
to teach me how to assault people.”

       “Oh,   what Jood  is  that?”  the  Constable sneered, and suddenly  he
reached out and Jrabbed Nell by the hair—not hard enouJh to hurt. He held

315
her for a few moments, and then let her Jo. “Thus endeth the first lesson,”
he said.

       “You  think that , should cut my hair off?”

       The Constable looked terribly disappointed. “Oh, no,”  he said, “never,
ever, ever cut your hair  off.  ,f  , Jrabbed you  by your wrist”—and   he did
—“would you cut your arm off?”

       “No,  sir.”

       “Did  the Primer teach you that people would pull your hair?”

       “No,  sir.”

       “Did  it teach you that your mother's boyfriends would beat you up, and
your mother not protect you?”

       “No,   sir, except insofar  as it  told  me stories  about people who  did
evil.”

       “People  doinJ  evil  is a  Jood lesson. What  you  saw in  there a few
weeks aJo”—and by this Nell knew he was referrinJ to the headless soldier
on the mediatron—“is one application of that lesson, but it's too obvious to
be of any Jood. Ah, but your mother not protectinJ you from  boyfriends—
that has some subtlety, doesn't it?

       “Nell,”   the Constable continued, indicatinJ  throuJh his tone of  voice
that  the lesson  was  concludinJ,  “the   difference  between iJnorant  and
educated people is that the latter know more facts. But that has nothinJ to
do with   whether they  are stupid  or  intelliJent.   The  difference between
stupid and intelliJent people—and this is true whether or not they are well-
educated—is that  intelliJent   people can  handle  subtlety. They  are  not
baffled by ambiJuous or even contradictory situations—in fact, they expect
them  and  are   apt  to   become  suspicious  when   thinJs   seem  overly
straiJhtforward.

316
       “,n   your  Primer  you   have a  resource that  will   make  you  hiJhly
educated, but it will never make you intelliJent. That comes from life. Your
life  up to  this point  has Jiven  you all  of  the  experience you need to be
intelliJent, but you have to think about those experiences. ,f you don't think
about them, you'll be psycholoJically  unwell.  ,f  you do think  about them,
you will  become not merely educated but intelliJent, and then, a few years
down the road,  you will   probably Jive  me  cause to wish  ,  were several
decades younJer.”

       The  Constable turned and walked back  into  his house, leavinJ  Nell
alone in  the Jarden,  ponderinJ  the meaninJ  of  that last  statement. She
supposed it was the sort of thinJ she miJht understand later, when she had
become intelliJent.


                       Carl Hollywood  returns from abroad; he and
                          Miranda  discuss the status and future of 
                                            her racting career. 



Carl Hollywood  came back from a month-lonJ trip  to London,  where he'd
been visitinJ old  friends, catchinJ  some live theatre, and makinJ  face-to-
face contacts with some of the biJ ractive developers, hopinJ to swinJ some
contracts in their direction. When he Jot back, the whole company threw a
party for him in the theatre's little bar. Miranda thouJht she handled it pretty
well.

       But  the  next day  he cornered her backstaJe. “What's  up?”  he said.
“And ,  don't mean that in the usual offhanded way. , want  to know what's
JoinJ on with  you. Why have you switched to the eveninJ shift  durinJ my
absence? And why were you actinJ so weird at the party?”

       “Well,  Nell and , have had an interestinJ few months.”

       Carl  looked startled, stepped back half a pace, then siJhed and rolled
his eyes.

317
       “Of  course, her altercation with  Burt was traumatic, but she seems to
have dealt with it well.”

       “Who's Burt?”

       “,  have no idea. Someone who was physically abusinJ her. Apparently
she manaJed to  find  some kind  of  new  livinJ   situation  in  short  order,
probably with  the assistance of her brother  Harv, who  has, however, not
stayed with her—he's stuck in  the same old bad situation, while  Nell  has
moved on to somethinJ better.”

       “She has? That's Jood news,” said Carl, only half sarcastically.

       Miranda  smiled at  him. “See? That's  exactly the kind  of  feedback ,
need. , don't talk about this stuff to  anyone because ,'m afraid they'll think
,'m mad. Thank you. Keep it up.”

       “What  is Nell's new situation?” Carl Hollywood asked contritely.

       “,   think she's in  school somewhere. She appears to be learninJ new
material that  isn't explicitly   covered in  the Primer,  and she's developinJ
more  sophisticated  forms  of   social   interaction,  suJJestinJ   that  she's
spendinJ more time around a hiJher class of people.”

       “Excellent.”

       “She's  not  as  concerned  with  immediate  issues  of  physical  self-
defense, so , Jather that she's in a safe livinJ situation. However, her new
Juardian must be an emotionally distant sort, because she freTuently seeks
solace under the winJs of Duck.”

       Carl looked funny. “Duck?”

       “One  of four  personaJes who accompanies and advises Princess Nell.
Duck embodies domestic, maternal virtues.  Actually,  Peter and Dinosaur
are now Jone—both male fiJures who embodied survival skills.”

318
       “Who's the fourth one?”

       “Purple.  , think  she'll become a lot more relevant to Nell's life around
puberty.”

       “Puberty? You said Nell was between five and seven.”

       “So?”

       “You  think you'll  still  be doinJ this—”  Carl's voice  wound down to a
stop as he worked out the implications.

       “—for   at least six or eiJht  years. Oh yes, , should certainly  think so.
,t's a very serious commitment, raisinJ a child.”

       “Oh,   Jod!”   Carl  Hollywood   said, and  collapsed  into  a  biJ,  tatty,
overstuffed chair they kept backstaJe for such purposes.

       “That's why  ,'ve switched to the eveninJ shift.  Ever since Nell started
JoinJ to  school, she's started usinJ the Primer exclusively in  the eveninJ.
Apparently she's in a time ]one within one or two hours of this one.”

       “Good,”   Carl  muttered, “that  narrows it  down  to  about half  of  the
world's population.”

       “What's the problem here?” Miranda said. “,t's  not like ,'m not JettinJ
paid for this.”

       Carl Jave her a Jood, dispassionate, searchinJ look. “Yes. ,t brinJs in
adeTuate revenue.”


                   Three girls  go exploring;  a conversation between
                        Lord Finkle-McGraw  and Mrs.  Hackworth; 
                                        afternoon  at the estate. 

319
Three Jirls  moved across the billiard-table  lawn  of a  Jreat manor house,
circlinJ  and swarminJ about  a common center of  Jravity  like  JambolinJ
sparrows. Sometimes they would stop, turn inward to face one another, and
enJaJe in animated discussion. Then they would suddenly take off runninJ,
seeminJly free from the constraints of inertia, like petals struck by a Just of
sprinJ wind. They wore lonJ heavy wool coats over their dresses to protect
them from the cool  damp air of  New Chusan's hiJh central plateau. They
seemed to be makinJ their way toward an expanse of broken Jround some
half-mile distant, separated from the Jreat house's formal Jardens by a Jray
stone wall splashed with bits  of lime  Jreen and lavender where moss and
lichen had taken hold. The terrain beyond the wall was a muted ha]el color,
like a bolt of  Harris tweed that has tumbled from the back of a waJon and
come undone, thouJh the incipient bloominJ of the heather had flunJ a pale
violet mist across it, nearly transparent but startlinJly vivid  in  those places
where the observer's line of siJht Jra]ed the natural slope of the terrain—if
the word natural  could  properly be  applied to  any feature of  this island.
Otherwise as liJht and free as birds, the Jirls were each weiJhed down by a
small burden that seemed inconJruous in the present settinJ, for the efforts
of the adults to persuade them to leave their books behind had, as ever, been
unavailinJ.

       One of  the observers had eyes only for the little Jirl  with  lonJ flame-
colored hair. Her connexion to that child was suJJested by her auburn hair
and eyebrows. She was dressed in  a hand-sewn frock  of  woven  cotton,
whose crispness betrayed its recent provenance in  a  milliner's  atelier  in
Dovetail. ,f the JatherinJ had included more veterans of that elonJated state
of low-intensity   warfare known  as Society, this  observation would  have
been keenly   made  by  those  soi-disant  sentries  who   stood  upon  the
battlements, keepinJ viJil  aJainst bounders who would struJJle their  way
up the vast Jlacis separatinJ waJe slaves from ETuity Participants. ,t would
have been duly noted  and set forth  in  the oral  tradition  that Gwendolyn
Hackworth,   thouJh   attractive,  hard-waisted,   and  poised,   lacked  the
confidence to visit  Lord  Finkle-McGraw's house in  anythinJ other  than a
new dress made for the occasion.

320
       The Jray  liJht  suffusinJ the drawinJ  room throuJh  its hiJh  windows
was as Jentle as mist. As  Mrs.  Hackworth stood  enveloped in that liJht,
sippinJ beiJe tea from a cup of translucent bone china, her face let down its
Juard and betrayed some evidence of her true state of mind. Her host, Lord
Finkle-McGraw, thouJht  that she looked  drawn and troubled,  thouJh her
vivacious comportment durinJ the first hour of  their interview  had led him
to suppose otherwise.

       SensinJ that  his Ja]e  had linJered  on  her face for  lonJer  than was
strictly proper, he looked to the three little Jirls  amblinJ across the Jarden.
One of the Jirls had raven hair that betrayed her partly Korean heritaJe; but
havinJ established her whereabouts as a sort of reference point, he shifted
his attention  to  the third  Jirl,   whose hair  was about  halfway  throuJh a
natural and Jradual transition from blond to brown. This Jirl was the tallest
of  the  three, thouJh  all  were  of  about  the  same aJe;  and thouJh  she
participated freely  in  all  of  their liJhthearted  James, she rarely  initiated
them and, when left to  her own devices, tended toward a Jrave mien  that
made her seem years older than her playmates. As the ETuity Lord watched
the trio's  proJress, he sensed that  even the style  of  her  movement was
different from  the others'; she was lithe and carefully balanced, while they
bounded unpredictably like rubber balls on rouJh-hewn stone.

       The difference  was (as he reali]ed, watchinJ  them more keenly) that
Nell always  knew where  she was JoinJ.  Eli]abeth  and  Fiona never did.
This was a Tuestion not of  native intelliJence  (Miss Matheson's tests and
observations proved that much) but of emotional stance. SomethinJ in the
Jirl's past had tauJht her, most forcefully, the importance of thinkinJ thinJs
throuJh.

       “,  ask you for a prediction, Mrs. Hackworth. Which one shall reach the
moor first?”

       At  the sound of his voice, Mrs. Hackworth recomposed her face. “This
sounds like a letter to the etiTuette columnist of the Times. ,f , try to flatter
you by JuessinJ that it will be your JranddauJhter, am , implicitly  accusinJ
her of impulsiveness?”

321
       The ETuity Lord smiled tolerantly. “Let  us set aside etiTuette—a social
convention not relevant to this enTuiry—and be scientific.”

       “Ah.  ,f only  my -ohn were here.”

       He is here, Lord  Finkle-McGraw thouJht,  in each one of those books.
But  he  didn't  say it.   “Very  well,   ,  will   expose  myself  to  the  risk  of
humiliation  by  predictinJ  that Eli]abeth  reaches the wall  first;   that Nell
finds the  secret way  throuJh;  but that  your  dauJhter is  the first  one  to
venture throuJh it.”

       “,'m  sure you could never be humiliated in my presence, Your Grace,”
Mrs. Hackworth said. ,t was somethinJ she had to say, and he did not really
hear it.

       They  turned  back to  the  windows.  When the  Jirls  had  reached to
within  a stone's throw  of  the  wall,  they beJan  to move  toward  it  more
purposefully. Eli]abeth broke free from the Jroup, ran forward, and was the
first to touch the cool stones, followed a few paces later by Fiona. Nell was
far behind, not havinJ altered her steady stride.

       “Eli]abeth   is a Duke's JranddauJhter, accustomed to havinJ her way,
and has no natural reticence; she surJes to the fore and claims the Joal as
her birthriJht,”  Finkle-McGraw  explained. “But  she has not really thouJht
about what she is doinJ.”

       Eli]abeth  and Fiona both had their hands on the wall now, as if it were
Home in  a Jame of  taJ. But  Nell  had stopped and was turninJ  her head
from  side to  side, surveyinJ  the lenJth  of  the wall   as it  clambered and
tumbled over the increasinJly rouJh shape of the land. After some time she
held out one hand, pointinJ at a section of  the wall a short  distance away,
and beJan to move toward it.

       “Nell  stands above the fray and thinks,” Finkle-McGraw  said. “To the
other Jirls, the wall is a decorative feature, no? A pretty thinJ to run to and
explore. But not to Nell.  Nell  knows what a wall is.  ,t is a knowledJe that
went into her early, knowledJe she doesn't have to think about. Nell is more

322
interested in  Jates  than  in  walls.   Secret hidden  Jates  are particularly
interestinJ.”

       Fiona and Eli]abeth  moved uncertainly, trailinJ  their  tiny  pink hands
across the damp stone, unable to see where Nell  was leadinJ them.  Nell
strode across the Jrass until she had reached a small declivity. She almost
disappeared into it  as she clambered down toward  the foundation  of the
wall.

       “An  openinJ for  drainaJe,” Finkle-McGraw  explained. “Please do not
be concerned. , happened to ride that way this morninJ. The current is only
ankle-deep, and the diameter  of  the culvert  Must riJht for  eiJht-year-old
Jirls. The passaJe is several meters lonJ—more promisinJ than threateninJ,
, should hope.”

       Fiona and Eli]abeth moved cautiously, startled by Nell's discovery. All
three of the Jirls disappeared into the cleft. A few moments later, a bla]e of
fiery red  could be descried bouncinJ  rapidly across the moor  beyond the
wall.  Fiona clambered up  a small  outcroppinJ  of  rocks that  marked the
beJinninJ of the moor, and beckoned excitedly to her companions.

       “The  secret passaJe is found by Nell, but she is cautious and patient.
Eli]abeth is taken aback by her early impulsiveness—she feels foolish and
perhaps even a bit sullen. Fiona—”

       “Fiona  sees a maJical Jateway to an enchanted kinJdom, no doubt,”
Mrs. Hackworth said, “and even now is crestfallen to find that you have not
stocked the premises with unicorns and draJons. She would not hesitate for
a moment to fly down that tunnel. This world  is not where my Fiona wants
to live, Your Grace. She wants another world, where maJic is everywhere,
and stories come to life, and …”

       Her voice trailed away, and she cleared her throat uncomfortably. Lord
Finkle-McGraw  Jlanced at her and saw pain in  her face, Tuickly masked.
He understood the rest of her sentence without hearinJ it: .         .         . and
my husband is here with us.

323
       A  pair of riders, a man and a woman, trotted up a Jravel path that ran
alonJ the edJe of the Jardens, throuJh a pair of  wrouJht-iron  Jates in the
stone wall, which  opened for them.  The man was Lord  Finkle-McGraw's
son Colin, the woman was his wife, and they had ridden out onto the moor
to keep an eye on their dauJhter and her two little friends. SeeinJ that their
supervision  was  no  lonJer   reTuired,  Lord   Finkle-McGraw   and   Mrs.
Hackworth turned away from the window and drew instinctively closer to a
fire burninJ in a stone fireplace the si]e of a JaraJe.

       Mrs. Hackworth  sat down in a small rocker, and the ETuity Lord chose
an old  and inconJruously  battered leather winJ  chair.  A  servant poured
more tea. Mrs. Hackworth set the saucer and cup in her lap, JuardinJ it with
her hands, and collected herself.

       “,   have  been  desirous of   makinJ  certain  enTuiries  reJardinJ  my
husband's whereabouts and activities, which have been a  mystery to  me
almost since the  moment he departed,”  she said, “and  yet  ,  was led  to
believe, from the very Jeneral and Juarded statements he made to me, that
the nature of  those activities  is  secret, and that,  if  Your  Grace has any
knowledJe of  them—and that  you do,  is  of  course merely a  convenient
supposition on  my  part—you  must  treat  that  knowledJe  with  flawless
discretion. ,t  Joes without  sayinJ, ,  trust,  that ,  would  not  use even my
feeble powers of persuasion to induce you to violate the trust reposed in you
by a hiJher power.”

       “Let  us take it as a Jiven that both of  us will  do what is honourable,”
Finkle-McGraw said with a reassurinJly casual smile.

       “Thank  you. My  husband continues to write me letters, every week or
so, but  they are extremely  Jeneral, nonspecific,  and perfunctory.  But  in
recent months,  these letters  have  become  full   of  stranJe  imaJes  and
emotions. They are—bi]arre. , have beJun to fear for my husband's mental
stability, and for the prospects of any undertakinJ that relies upon his Jood
MudJment. And while , would not hesitate to tolerate his absence for as lonJ
as is necessary for him to carry out his duties, the uncertainty has become
most tryinJ for me.”

324
       “,   am not  wholly   iJnorant  of  the matter, and  ,  do  not think   ,  am
violatinJ any trust when , say that you are not the only person who has been
surprised by  the  duration  of   his  absence,” Lord   Finkle-McGraw   said.
“8nless  ,  am very  much  mistaken, those who  conceived of  his mission
never imaJined that it would last for  so lonJ. ,t may ease your sufferinJ in
some small deJree to know that he is not thouJht to be in danJer.”

       Mrs. Hackworth smiled dutifully,  and not for very lonJ.

       “Little  Fiona seems to handle her father's absence well.”

       “Oh,  but to Fiona, he has never been Jone,” Mrs. Hackworth said. “,t
is the book, you see, that ractive book. When -ohn Jave it to her, Must before
he departed, he said that it was maJic, and that he would talk to her throuJh
it. , know it's nonsense, of course, but she really believes that whenever she
opens that book, her father reads her a story and even plays with her in an
imaJinary world,  so that she hasn't really missed him  at all.  ,  haven't the
heart  to  tell   her  that   it's  nothinJ   more  than   a  computeri]ed   media
proJramme.”

       “,  am inclined to  believe that, in this case, keepinJ her in iJnorance is
a very wise policy,” Finkle-McGraw said.

       “,t  has served her well thus far. But  as time Joes on, she is more and
more fliJhty  and less disposed to concentrate on her schoolwork. She lives
in a fantasy and is happy there. But when she learns that the fantasy is Must
that, , fear it will not Jo well  for her.”

       “She  is   hardly  the  first   younJ  lady   to  display  siJns  of   a  vivid
imaJination,” the ETuity  Lord said. “Sooner or  later they seem to turn out
all riJht.”

       The three little  explorers, and their two adult outriders, returned to the
Jreat house shortly. Lord  Finkle-McGraw's  desolate private moor was  as
alienated from  the  tastes of  little   Jirls  as  sinJle  malt  whiskey,  Gothic
architecture, muted  colors,  and  Bruckner   symphonies. Once  they  had
reached it and found that  it  was not eTuipped with  pink  unicorns, cotton

325
candy vendors, teen idol bands, or fluorescent Jreen water slides, they lost
interest and beJan to Jravitate toward the house—which in and of itself was
far  from  Disneyland,  but  in  which  a  practiced  and assertive  user like
Eli]abeth could find  a few consolatory nuJJets, such as a full-time kitchen
staff,  trained   in   (amonJ  many   other,  completely   useless skills)   the
preparation of hot chocolate.

       HavinJ  come  as close to  the  subMect of -ohn Percival Hackworth's
disappearance as they dared, and careened past it with no damaJe except
some hot faces and watery eyes, Lord Finkle-McGraw and Mrs. Hackworth
had withdrawn,  by  mutual  consent, to  cooler subMects. The Jirls would
come inside to drink some hot chocolate, and then it would be time for the
Juests to repair to the Tuarters assiJned them for the day, where they could
freshen up and dress for the main event: dinner.

       “,  should be pleased to look after the other little  Jirl—Nell—until   the
dinner hour,”  Mrs.   Hackworth  said. “,   noticed that  the  Jentleman who
brouJht her round this morninJ has not returned from the hunt.”

       The  ETuity Lord  chuckled  as he imaJined  General Moore tryinJ   to
help a little Jirl dress for dinner. He was Jraceful enouJh to know his limits,
and so he was spendinJ the day shootinJ  on the remoter stretches of  the
estate. “Little Nell has a talent for lookinJ after herself and may not need or
wish to accept your most Jenerous offer. But she miJht enMoy spendinJ the
interim with Fiona.”

       “ForJive  me,  Your Grace, but ,  am startled that you  would  consider
leavinJ a child of her aJe unattended for most of the afternoon.”

       “She would  not view  it in  that way, , assure you, for the same reason
that little Fiona does not think of her father as ever havinJ left your house.”

       The expression that passed over Mrs. Hackworth's  face as she heard
this statement suJJested less than perfect comprehension. But before she
could explain to her host the error of his ways, they were interrupted by the
sound of a shrill  and bitter  conflict  makinJ its  way down  the hall toward
them. The door swunJ open halfway, and Colin Finkle-McGraw  appeared.

326
His face was still ruddy from the wind on the moor, and it bore a forced Jrin
that  was not   terribly  distant  from   a  smirk;  thouJh   his  brow  knit   up
periodically as Eli]abeth  emitted an especially piercinJ shriek of  anJer. ,n
one hand he held a  copy of  the Young Lady's Illustrated  Primer.  Behind
him, Mrs. Finkle-McGraw could be seen holdinJ Eli]abeth by the wrist in  a
Jrip that  recalled the blacksmith's  tonJs holdinJ  a danJerously hot  inJot
ready for smitinJ; and the radiant Jlow of the little  Jirl's face perfected that
analoJy. She had bent down so that her face was level with Eli]abeth's and
was hissinJ somethinJ to her in a low and reproachinJ tone.

       “Sorry,  Father,” the younJer Finkle-McGraw  said in a voice slathered
with not very convincinJ  synthetic Jood humor. “Nap time, obviously.”  He
nodded to  the other.  “Mrs.   Hackworth.”  Then  his  eyes returned to  his
father's face and followed  the ETuity Lord's  Ja]e  downward to the  book.
“She was rude to the servants, Father, and so we have confiscated the book
for the rest of the afternoon. ,t's the only punishment that seems to sink in—
we employ it with some freTuency.”

       “Then  perhaps it   is not  sinkinJ  in   as well  as  you  suppose,” Lord
Finkle-McGraw said, lookinJ sad and soundinJ bemused.

       Colin  Finkle-McGraw   chose to  interpret this  remark as  a witticism
tarJeted primarily  at Eli]abeth—but  then,  parents of small  children must
perforce  have  an   entirely   different   sense of   irony   than   unimpaired
humankind.

       “We  can't let  her spend her life  between the covers of your  maJical
book, Father.  ,t   is  like   a little   interactive   empire,  with  Eli]abeth   the
empress, issuinJ all sorts of perfectly bloodcurdlinJ decrees to her obedient
subMects. ,t's important to brinJ her back to reality from time to time, so that
she can Jet some perspective.”

       “Perspective.  Very  well,   ,  shall  look   forward  to   seeinJ you   and
Eli]abeth, with her new perspective, at dinner.”

       “Good  afternoon, Father. Mrs. Hackworth,” the younJer man said, and
closed the door, a heavy masterpiece of the woodcarver's art and  a fairly

327
effective decibel absorbant.

       Gwendolyn Hackworth  now saw somethinJ in Lord  Finkle-McGraw's
face that made her  want  to leave  the room.  After  speedinJ throuJh  the
obliJatory  pleasantries, she did. She  collected Fiona  from  the chimney-
corner where she was cherishinJ the dreJs of her hot  chocolate. Nell was
there too, readinJ her copy of  the Primer, and Gwendolyn  was startled to
see that she had not touched her drink at all.

       “What  is this?” she exclaimed in what she took to be an appropriately
suJary voice. “A little Jirl  who doesn't like hot chocolate?”

       Nell  was deeply absorbed in her book, and for a moment Gwendolyn
thouJht that her words had Jone unheard. But a few  beats later it became
evident that the child was merely postponinJ her response until she reached
the end of a chapter. Then she raised her eyes slowly from the paJe of the
book. Nell was a reasonably attractive Jirl  in  the way that almost all  Jirls
are before immoderate tides of  hormones start to make different  parts of
their faces Jrow  out  of  proportion  to  others; she had  liJht  brown  eyes,
JlowinJ  oranJe in the liJht  of  the fire,  with  a kind of  feral slant to  them.
Gwendolyn found  it  difficult   to break  her Ja]e;  she felt  like  a  captured
butterfly starinJ up throuJh a maJnifyinJ lens into the calm, keen eye of the
naturalist.

       “Chocolate is fine,”  Nell said. “The Tuestion is, do , need it.”

       There  was a  rather  lonJ  pause in  the  conversation as  Gwendolyn
Jroped for somethinJ to say. Nell  did not seem to be awaitinJ  a response;
she had delivered her opinion and was done with it.

       “Well,”   Gwendolyn  finally  said,  “if  you  should decide  that there is
anythinJ you do need, please know that , would be happy to assist you.”

       “Your  offer  is most  kind. ,  am in  your  debt, Mrs. Hackworth,”   Nell
said. She said it perfectly, like a princess in a book.

328
       “Very  well. Good afternoon,”  Gwendolyn said. She took Fiona's hand
and led her  upstairs. Fiona  dawdled in  a way  that  was almost perfectly
calculated to annoy, and responded to her mother's Tuestions only with nods
and shakes of the head, because, as always, her mind was elsewhere. Once
they had reached their temporary Tuarters in the Juest winJ, Gwendolyn Jot
Fiona settled into bed for a nap, then sat down at an escritoire to work her
way  throuJh  some pendinJ  correspondence. But  now  Mrs.  Hackworth
found that her own mind  was elsewhere, as she pondered these three very
stranJe Jirls—the three smartest little Jirls in Miss Matheson's Academy—
each with her very  stranJe relationship with  her Primer. Her  Ja]e  drifted
away from  the sheets of mediatronic paper scattered about the escritoire,
out the window, and across the moor, where a Jentle shower had beJun to
fall.  She devoted the better part  of  an hour  to worryinJ   about Jirls  and
Primers.

       Then  she  remembered an  assertion  that  her  host  had  made that
afternoon, which  she had not  fully   appreciated at the  time:  These Jirls
weren't any stranJer than any other Jirls, and to blame their behavior on the
Primers was to miss the point entirely.

       Greatly  reassured, she took out her silver  pen and  beJan to write  a
letter to her missinJ husband, who had never seemed so far away.


                    Miranda  receives an unusual ractive message; a
                   drive through  the streets of Shanghai; the Cathay 
                      Hotel; a sophisticated soirée; Carl Hollywood     
                         introduces her to two unusual  characters. 



It was a few  minutes before midniJht,  and Miranda was about to siJn  off
from the eveninJ shift  and clear out of  her body staJe. This was a Friday
niJht. Nell had apparently decided not to pull an all-niJhter this time.

       On  school niJhts,  Nell  reliably  went  to  bed between ten-thirty  and
eleven, but Friday was her niJht to immerse herself in  the Primer the way
she had as a small child, six or seven years aJo, when all of this had started.

329
RiJht  now, Nell   was stuck  in  a  part of  the  story  that  must have  been
frustratinJ for her, namely, tryinJ to pu]]le   out the social rituals of a rather
bi]arre cult  of  faeries that had thrown  her into  an underJround labyrinth.
She'd fiJure it out eventually—she always did—but not toniJht.

       Miranda stayed onstaJe for an extra hour and a half, playinJ a role in a
samurai ractive fairly popular in -apan, in  which she was a platinum blond
missionary's dauJhter abducted from NaJasaki by ronin. All  she had to do
was sTueal a lot and eventually be rescued by a Jood samurai. ,t was a pity
she didn't  speak Nipponese and  (beyond  that) wasn't  familiar   with  the
theatrical style of  that nation,  because supposedly they were doinJ some
radical and interestinJ thinJs  with  karamaku—“empty  screen” or “empty
act.” EiJht  years aJo, she would  have taken the  one-hour airship ride  to
Nippon and learned the lanJuaJe. Four years aJo, she at least would have
been disJusted with  herself for  playinJ  this  stupid role.  But  toniJht  she
spoke her lines on cue, sTuealed and wriJJled at the riJht times, and took
her money, alonJ with  a hefty  tip  and the inevitable  mash note from  the
payer—a middle-manaJement type in Osaka who wanted to Jet to know her
better. Of course, the same technoloJy that made it impossible for Miranda
to find Nell, made it impossible for this creep to find Miranda.

       An  urJent Mob offer flashed over her screen Must as she was puttinJ her
stuff  toJether. She checked the  Enquiry  screen; the  Mob didn't pay  that
much, but it was of  very short duration. So she accepted it. She wondered
who was  sendinJ her  urJent  Mob offers; six years  aJo it   had happened
freTuently, but since she'd Jone into her habit of workinJ the eveninJ shift
she had, in Jeneral,  become Must another interchanJeable Western bimbo
with an unpronounceable name.

       ,t  looked like  some kind of  weird  bohemian art piece, some ractors'-
workshop proMect from her  distant past:  a surreal  landscape of abstract
colored Jeometric forms with  faces occasionally risinJ out of  flat surfaces
to speak lines. The  faces were texture-mapped, as if  wearinJ elaborately
painted makeup, or were sculpted to the texture of  oranJe peels, alliJator
hide, or durian fruit.

330
       “We  miss her,”  said one of  the faces, the voice  a little  familiar,  but
disped into a weird Jhostly echoinJ moan.

       “Where is she?” said another face, rather familiar in its shape.

       “Why  has she abandoned us?” said a third face, and even throuJh the
texture-mappinJ   and   the   voice    dispinJ,   Miranda    recoJni]ed    Carl
Hollywood.

       “,f   only  she  would  come to  our  party!”   cried  another one, whom
Miranda  recoJni]ed   as  a  member  of   the   Parnasse Company  named
Christine somethinJ-or-other.

       The prompter Jave her a line: Sorry, guys, but I'm  working late again
tonight.

       “Okay, okay,” Miranda said, “,'m  JoinJ to ad lib. Where are you?”

       “The  cast party, dummy!”   said Carl. “There's  a cab waitinJ  for  you
outside—we sprunJ for a half-laner!”

       Miranda  pulled out of  the ractive, finished tidyinJ  up the body  staJe,
and left it open so that some other member of the company could come in a
few hours later and work the Jold shift. She ran down the helical Jauntlet of
plaster cherubs, muses, and TroMans, across the lobby where a couple of
bleary-eyed apprentice  ractors  were  cleaninJ  up  the  debris  from   this
eveninJ's live  performance, and out  the front  doors. There  in the  street,
illuminated by the Tueasy pink-and-purple neon of the marTuee, was a half-
lane cab with its liJhts on.

       She was dully surprised when the driver headed toward the Bund, not
toward  the  midrise  districts  in   PudonJ, where  tribeless,  lower-income
Westerners typically  had  their   flats.  Cast  parties  usually  happened in
someone's livinJ room.

       Then she reminded herself that the Parnasse was a successful theatre
company nowadays, that  they had  a  whole buildinJ   somewhere full   of

331
developers cominJ up  with  new  ractives, that  the current  production of
Macbeth had cost a lot of  money. Carl had flown  to Tokyo and Shen]hen
and San Francisco seekinJ investors and had not come back empty-handed.
The first month of performances was sold out.

       But  toniJht, there had been a lot of empty seats in the house, because
most of the openinJ-niJht  crowd was non-Chinese, and non-Chinese were
nervous about JoinJ out on the streets because of rumors about the Fists of
RiJhteous Harmony.

       Miranda  was  nervous too,  thouJh  she wouldn't   admit  it.  The  taxi
turned a corner, and its headliJhts swept  across a knot of  younJ Chinese
men Jathered in a  doorway, and as one  of them  lifted  a ciJarette  to his
mouth, she cauJht a Jlimpse of  a scarlet ribbon knotted around his  wrist.
Her chest clenched up, her heart fluttered, and she had to swallow  hard a
few times. But  the younJ men could not  see into the silvered windows of
the cab. They  did not  converJe on her,  brandishinJ weapons and cryinJ
“Sha! Sha!”

       The Cathay Hotel stood in  the middle of the Bund,  at the intersection
with  NanMinJ Road, the Rodeo Drive of the  Far East. As  far as Miranda
could see—all the way to NanMinJ, maybe—it was lined with Western and
Nipponese boutiTues and department stores, and the  airspace above the
street was besprent with   almond-si]e  aerostats, each with  its  own  cine
camera and  pattern-recoJnition   ware  to   watch  for   suspicious-lookinJ
conJreJations of younJ men who miJht be Fist cells.

       Like   all  of  the other  biJ  Western buildinJs   on the  waterfront,  the
Cathay was  outlined  in  white  liJht,   which  was probably  a  Jood  thinJ
because otherwise it wouldn't  have  looked like   much. The  exterior was
bleak and dinJy in the daytime.

       She played  a little   Jame of  chicken  with  the  doorman. She strode
toward the entrance, confident that he'd haul the door open for her, but he
stood there with  his  hands clasped behind his  back, starinJ  back at  her

332
sullenly. Finally he Jave way and hauled the door open, thouJh she had to
break her stride so as not to smash into it.

       GeorJe Bernard  Shaw had stayed here; Noel  Coward had  written  a
play here. The lobby  was hiJh  and  narrow, Beaux Arts  marble, Jlorious
ironwork  chandeliers, white   liJht  from   the  Bund  buildinJs  filterinJ   in
throuJh stained-Jlass arches. An ancient Ma]] band was playinJ in the bar,
slap bass over trashcan drums. Miranda  stood on  tiptoe in  the  entrance,
lookinJ  for   the party,  and  saw  nothinJ  except  middle-aJed  Caucasian
airship tourists slow-dancinJ and the usual lineup of  sharp younJ Chinese
men alonJ the bar, hopinJ she'd come in.

       Eventually  she found  her way  up to  the eiJhth  floor,  where all  the
fancy restaurants were. The biJ banTuet room had been rented out by some
kind  of   Jarishly  wealthy   orJani]ation   and  was  full   of   men  wearinJ
intimidatinJly  sophisticated suits, women wearinJ even more intimidatinJ
dresses, and the odd sprinklinJ of Victorians wearinJ far more conservative
—but still  dapper and expensive—stuff.  The music was fairly   restrained,
Must one tuxedoed Chinese man playinJ Ma]] on a Jrand piano,  but on  a
staJe at one end of the room, a larJer band was settinJ up its eTuipment.

       She was Must crinJinJ away, wonderinJ in what back room the scruffy
actors' bash miJht  be found,  when she heard someone callinJ  her name
from inside.

       Carl  Hollywood  was  approachinJ, stridinJ  across the middle  of  the
banTuet hall like he  owned the place, resplendent in hand-tooled cowboy
boots made of many supple and exotic bird and reptile skins, wearinJ a vast
raiment, sort of  a cross between a cape and a Western duster, that nearly
brushed the floor, and that made him look seven feet tall rather than a mere
six  and a  half.  His  lonJ   blond  hair  was brushed back  away  from  his
forehead, his KinJ   Tut  beard was sharp and  straiJht  as a hoe.  He was
JorJeous and he knew  it,  and his blue  eyes were piercinJ  riJht  throuJh
Miranda, holdinJ  her  there in  front  of  the  open elevator doors, throuJh
which she'd almost escaped.

333
       He Jave her a biJ huJ and whirled her around. She shrank aJainst him,
shielded from the crowd in the banTuet hall by his envelopinJ cloak. “, look
like shit,” she said. “Why didn't you tell  me it was JoinJ to be this kind of a
party?”

       “Why   didn't you  know?”  Carl said. As  a director, one  of his  talents
was to ask the most difficult imaJinable Tuestions.

       “,  would have worn somethinJ different. , look like—”

       “You  look like  a younJ bohemian artiste,” Carl said, steppinJ back to
examine her typically form-fittinJ   black bodysuit, “who  doesn't Jive a shit
about pretentious  clothes, who   makes everyone  else in   the room   feel
overdressed, and who can Jet away with  it  because she's Jot that special
somethinJ.”

       “You  silver-tonJued doJ,” she said, “you know that's bullshit.”

       “A   few  years aJo  you would   have sailed into  that  room  with  that
lovely chin of yours held up like  a batterinJ ram, and everyone would have
stepped back to look at you. Why not now?”

       “,   don't  know,”   Miranda  said.  “,   think  with   this  Nell  thinJ,   ,'ve
incurred all  the  disadvantaJes of parenthood without  actually  JettinJ  to
have a child.”

       Carl  relaxed and softened, and Miranda knew she'd spoken the words
he was lookinJ for. “C'mere,” he said. “, want you to meet someone.”

       “,f   you're JoinJ to  try to fix  me up with  some wealthy son of a bitch
—”

       “Wouldn't  dream of it.”

       “,'m  not JoinJ to become a housewife who acts in her spare time.”

       “,  reali]e that,”  Carl said. “Now calm yourself for a minute.”

334
       Miranda was forcibly  iJnorinJ  the fact that they were walkinJ throuJh
the middle  of   the room  now.  Carl  Hollywood   was  drawinJ  all  of  the
attention, which suited her. She exchanJed smiles with a couple of ractors
who had appeared in the interactive invitation that had summoned her here;
both of  them were havinJ  what looked like  very  enMoyable conversations
with fine-lookinJ  people, probably investors.

       “Who  are you takinJ me to meet?”

       “A  Juy named Beck. An old acTuaintance of mine.”

       “But  not a friend?”

       Carl adopted an uncomfortable Jrin and shruJJed. “We've been friends
sometimes. We've also been collaborators. Business partners. This is how
life works, Miranda:  After  a while, you build  up a network of  people. You
pass them bits of data they miJht  be interested in and vice  versa. To me,
he's one of those Juys.”

       “,  can't help wonderinJ why you want me to meet him.”

       “,  believe,”  Carl said very Tuietly, but usinJ some actor's trick so that
she could hear every word, “that this Jentleman can help you find Nell. And
that you can help him find somethinJ he wants.”

       And  he stepped aside with a swirl of cloak, pullinJ out a chair for her.
They were in the corner of the banTuet hall. SittinJ on the opposite side of
the table, his back to  a larJe marble-silled  window, the illuminated  Bund
and the mediatronic cacophony of PudonJ spillinJ  bloody liJht  across the
Jlossy shoulder-pads of his suit, was a younJ  African  man in  dreadlocks,
wearinJ dark Jlasses with minuscule  circular lenses held in some kind  of
ostentatiously complex metallic space Jrid. SittinJ  next to him,  but hardly
noticed by Miranda, was a Nipponese businessman wearinJ a dark formal
kimono and smokinJ what smelled like an old-fashioned, fully carcinoJenic
ciJar.

335
       “Miranda,  this is  Mr. Beck  and Mr. Oda, both privateers. Gentlemen,
Ms. Miranda Redpath.”

       Both  men nodded in a pathetic vestiJe  of a bow,  but neither made a
move to shake hands, which  was Must as well—nowadays some ama]inJ
thinJs could  be  transferred throuJh  skin-to-skin  contact. Miranda  didn't
even nod back to  them; she Must sat down and let Carl scoot her in.  She
didn't like  people  who described themselves as privateers. ,t   was Must a
pretentious word for a thete—someone who didn't have a tribe.

       Either that, or they really did belonJ to tribes—from the looks of them,
probably some weird synthetic phyle she'd never heard of—and, for  some
reason, were pretendinJ not to.

       Carl said, “,  have explained to the Jentlemen, without JettinJ into any
details, that you would like  to do the impossible. Can , Jet  you somethinJ
to drink, Miranda?”

       After   Carl  Hollywood  left,   there was  a rather  lonJ  silence  durinJ
which Mr.  Beck presumably stared at Miranda,  thouJh she could  not tell
because of the dark Jlasses. Mr. Oda's primary function appeared to be that
of nervous spectator, as if he had waJered half of his net worth on whether
Miranda or Mr. Beck would speak first.

       A  strataJem occurred to Mr.  Oda. He pointed in  the direction  of the
bandstand and nodded siJnificantly. “You like this band?”

       Miranda  looked over at the band, half a do]en men and women in  an
assortment of races. Mr. Oda's Tuestion was difficult to answer because they
had not yet  made any music. She looked  back at  Mr.  Oda, who pointed
siJnificantly at himself.

       “Oh.  You're the backer?” Miranda said.

       Mr.  Oda withdrew a small JlitterinJ  obMect from his pocket and slid it
across the table  toward  Miranda.  ,t  was a  cloisonné pin   shaped like  a
draJonfly. She had noticed similar  ones adorninJ  several partyJoers. She

336
picked it  up cautiously. Mr. Oda  tapped himself on the lapel  and nodded,
encouraJinJ her to put it on.

       She left it sittinJ  there on the table for the time beinJ.

       “,'m   not seeinJ anythinJ,”  Mr.  Beck finally   said, apparently for  Mr.
Oda's benefit. “To a first approximation, she is clean.” Miranda reali]ed that
Mr. Beck  had been checkinJ  her out  usinJ  some kind  of  display in  his
phenomenoscopic Jlasses.

       Miranda was still  tryinJ to work  out some kind of unpleasant response
when Mr. Oda leaned forward into his own cloud of ciJar smoke. “,t  is our
understandinJ,” he said, “that you wish to make a connection. Your wish is
very stronJ.”

       Privateers.  The word  also  implied  that these Jentlemen, at  least in
their own minds, had some kind of  an anJle, some way of makinJ  money
off of their own lack of tribal  affiliation.

       “,'ve  been told that such thinJs are impossible.”

       “,t's  more correct to speak in probabilistic  terms,” said Mr. Beck.  His
accent was more Oxford  than anythinJ  else, with  a  -amaican lilt,   and a
crispness that owed somethinJ to ,ndia.

       “Astronomically  improbable, then,” Miranda said.

       “There you Jo,”  said Mr. Beck.

       Now,  somehow, the ball had found  its way  into  Miranda's court. “,f
you Juys think  you've found  a way to  beat probability, why  don't you Jo
into the VeJas ractives and make a fortune?”

       Misters Beck  and Oda were actually more amused by that crack than
she had expected them to be. They  were capable of irony.  That was one
Jood siJn  in  the almost overwhelminJ  barraJe  of neJative  siJnals she'd
been JettinJ from them so far.

337
       The band started up, playinJ dance music with a Jood beat. The liJhts
came down,  and  the  party  beJan  to  Jlitter   as liJht   flashed  from   the
draJonfly pins.

       “,t  wouldn't  work,”  Mr.  Beck said, “because VeJas is a Jame of pure
numbers with no human meaninJ to it.  The mind doesn't interface to pure
numbers.”

       “But  probability is probability,”  Miranda said.

       “What  if you  have a dream one niJht that your sister is in a crash, and
you  contact  her  the  next  day  and  learn  that  she  broke  up  with   her
boyfriend?”

       “,t  could be a coincidence.”

       “Yes. But not a very probable one. You see, maybe it's possible to beat
probability, when the heart as well as the mind is involved.”

       Miranda  supposed that neither Mr. Beck nor Mr.  Oda understood the
essential cruelty of what they were sayinJ. ,t  was much better not to have
any hope at all. “Are  you Juys involved  in some kind  of reliJious  thinJ?”
she said.

       Misters Beck and Oda looked at each other siJnificantly. Mr. Oda went
into some peculiar routine of  tooth-suckinJ and throat-clearinJ that would
probably convey a torrent of information  to another Nipponese person but
meant nothinJ to  Miranda,  other than  JivinJ  her  a Jeneral hint  that  the
situation was  rather  complicated. Mr.   Beck  produced an  antiTue silver
snuffbox,  or  a replica  of   one, took  out  a  pinch  of  nanosite  dust, and
hoovered it   up  into  one  of  his  Jreat  circular   nostrils,  then  nervously
scratched the underside of his nose. He slid his Jlasses way down, exposinJ
his biJ brown eyes, and stared distractedly over Miranda's shoulder into the
thick of the party, watchinJ the band and the dancers' reaction to it. He was
wearinJ a draJonfly  pin, which  had beJun to  Jlow  and to flash JorJeous
colored liJhts,  like  a fleet  of police  cars and firetrucks  Jathered round a
burninJ house.

338
       The band seJued into  a peculiar, tuneless, beatless miasma of noise,
spawninJ la]y convection currents in the crowd.

       “How  do you Juys know  Carl?” Miranda said, hopinJ to break the ice
a bit.

       Mr.  Oda shook his head apoloJetically. “, have not had the pleasure of
makinJ his acTuaintance until recently.”

       “8sed  to do thyuh-tuh with him in London.”

       “You're a ractor?”

       Mr.  Beck snorted ironically. A  varieJated silk hankie flourished in his
hand, and he blew his nose Tuickly and cleanly like a practiced snuff-taker.
“, am a technical boy,” he said.

       “You  proJram ractives?”

       “That  is a subset of my activities.”

       “You  do liJhts and sets? Or diJital stuff? Or nanotech?”

       “,nvidious   distinctions  do  not  interest  me. ,   am interested  in  one
thinJ,” said Mr. Beck, holdinJ  up his index finJer, topped with a very larJe
but perfectly  manicured claw  of a  finJernail,  “and  that is  use of tech  to
convey meaninJ.”

       “That  covers a lot of areas nowadays.”

       “Yes, but it shouldn't. That is to say that the distinctions between those
areas are boJus.”

       “What's wronJ  with Must proJramminJ ractives?”

       “NothinJ   at  all,”   said  Mr.   Beck,  “Must as nothinJ  is  wronJ   with
traditional live  theatre, or for  that  matter, sittinJ round  a campfire tellinJ
stories, like , used to enMoy on the beach when , was a lad. But as lonJ as

339
there are new ways to  be found, it  is  my Mob, as a technical boy, to find
them. Your art, lady, is ractinJ. SearchinJ for the new tech is mine.”

       The  noise cominJ from  the  band had beJun to pulse  irreJularly. As
they talked, the pulses Jathered themselves into beats and became steadier.
Miranda turned around to look at the people on the dance floor. They were
all standinJ  around with  faraway  looks  on their  faces, concentratinJ  on
somethinJ. Their  draJonfly  pins  were flashinJ  wildly   now,  MoininJ in a
coherent pulse of pure white on  each beat. Miranda reali]ed  that the pins
were somehow patched into  the wearers' nervous systems and  that they
were talkinJ to each other, creatinJ the music collectively. A Juitarist beJan
to weave  an  improvised melodic   line  throuJh  the Jradually   coalescinJ
pattern of sound, and the sound condensed around it as all of the dancers
heard the tune. They had a feedback loop JoinJ. A younJ woman beJan to
chant out some kind of tuneless rap that sounded improvised. As she went
on, she broke into melody. The music  was still  weird and formless, but it
was beJinninJ  to approach somethinJ  you miJht  hear  on a  professional
recordinJ.

       Miranda  turned back to face Mr.  Beck. “You  think you've  invented a
new way to convey meaninJ with technoloJy—”

       “Medium.”

       “A   new medium, and  that it  can help me  Jet what  , want.  Because
when meaninJ is involved, the laws of probability can be broken.”

       “There are two misconceptions in your statement. One: , did not invent
the medium. Others did, perhaps for different purposes, and , have stumbled
across it, or actually Must heard intimations.

       “As  far as the laws of probability, my lady, these cannot be broken, any
more than  any  other  mathematical principle.   But  laws  of  physics  and
mathematics are like a coordinate system that runs in only one dimension.
Perhaps there is another dimension perpendicular to it,  invisible  to  those
laws of physics, describinJ the same thinJs with  different rules, and those

340
rules are written in our hearts, in a deep place where we cannot Jo and read
them except in our dreams.”

       Miranda  looked to  Mr.  Oda, hopinJ he'd wink   or somethinJ, but  he
was starinJ into the dance floor with a terribly serious expression, as thouJh
enfolded in deep thouJhts himself, noddinJ sliJhtly.  Miranda  drew a deep
breath and siJhed.

       When she looked up  at Mr. Beck  aJain, he was watchinJ her, notinJ
her curiosity about Mr.  Oda. He turned one hand palm up and rubbed the
ball of his thumb over his finJertips.

       So Beck was the hacker and Oda was the backer. The oldest and most
troublesome relationship in the technoloJical world.

       “We  reTuire a third  participant,”  Mr.  Beck said, dovetailinJ  into  her
thouJhts.

       “To  do what?” Miranda said, evasive and defensive at the same time.

       “All   technomedia ventures have the  same structure,” said  Mr.  Oda,
bestirrinJ himself for  the first  time in a while.  By  now a nice synerJy had
developed between band and crowd, and a lot of dancinJ was JoinJ  on—
some intimidatinJly   sophisticated stuff,  and  also some primal   moshinJ.
“Three-leJJed tripod.” Oda held up a fist and beJan to extend finJers as he
enumerated the same. Miranda noted that his finJers were Jnarly and bent,
as if  they'd all  been broken freTuently. Mr.  Oda was,  perhaps, a veteran
practitioner  of  certain  martial  arts  now   disdained by   most  Nipponese
because of    their   lower-class   provenance.  “LeJ    number   one:   new
technoloJical idea. Mr. Beck. LeJ number two: adeTuate financial backinJ.
Mr. Oda. LeJ number three: the artist.”

       Misters Beck and Oda looked siJnificantly at Miranda. She threw back
her head and manaJed a nice solid lauJh, hittinJ  that sweet spot down in
her diaphraJm. ,t felt Jood. She shook her head, lettinJ her hair swinJ back
and forth across her shoulders. Then she leaned forward across the table,
shoutinJ to be heard above the band. “You Juys must be desperate. ,'m old

341
hat, Juys. There's half  a do]en  ractors in this  room with  better prospects
than me. Didn't Carl fill  you  in? ,'ve been holed up in a body staJe for six
years doinJ kid stuff. ,'m not a star.”

       “Star means a master of conventional ractives, which are precisely the
technoloJy we are tryinJ  to  move beyond,” said  Mr. Beck,  a bit  scornful
that she wasn't JettinJ it.

       Mr.  Oda pointed to the band. “None of these people were professional
musicians—some not even amateurs. Musician skills  are not relevant for
this—these people were new kinds of artists born too early.”

       “Almost too early,” Mr.  Beck said.

       “Oh,  my Jod,”  Miranda  said, startinJ to Jet it.  For the first  time, she
believed that what Beck and Oda were talkinJ about—whatever the hell it
was—was a  real possibility.   Which  meant that  she was  ninety  percent
convinced—thouJh only Beck and Oda understood that.

       ,t  was  too loud  to  talk.  A  mosher backed into  Miranda's chair  and
nearly fell over her. Beck stood up, came round the table, and extended one
hand, askinJ her to dance. Miranda looked into the Dionysian revel  fillinJ
the floor  and understood that the only way  to be  safe was to Moin it. She
plucked her draJonfly  pin  from  the tabletop  and followed  Beck  into the
midst of the dance. As she pinned it on, it  beJan to flash, and she thouJht
she heard a new strain woven into the sonJ.


                         From the Primer, Princess Nell enters into
                                      the lands of King  Coyote.

343
       Nell  turned the paJe and saw it, Must as the book said. This was a two-
paJe illustration—a color paintinJ, she reckoned. Any one part of it looked
Must as real as a cine  feed.  But  the  Jeometry of   the thinJ   was funny,
borrowinJ  some  suprarealistic  tricks  from   classical Chinese  landscape
paintinJ; the mountains were too steep, and they marched away forever into
the distance, and if Nell  stared, she could see tall castles clinJinJ  to their
impossibly precipitous slopes, colorful banners wavinJ from their flaJpoles
bearinJ heraldic devices that  were dynamic: The  Jryphons crouched, the
lions roared, and she could see all of these details, even thouJh the castles
should have been miles  away; whenever she looked  at somethinJ  it  Jot
biJJer and turned into a different picture, and when her attention wavered—
when she blinked and shook her  head—it snapped back to the first  view
aJain.

       She spent a lonJ time doinJ that, because there were do]ens of castles
at the  very  least, and  she Jot  the  feelinJ  that  if  she kept  lookinJ   and
countinJ  she miJht   look  forever.  But  it   wasn't all   castles: there  were
mountains, cities, rivers, lakes, birds and beasts, caravans, and travelers of
all kinds.

       She spent a while starinJ at a Jroup of  travelers who had drawn their
waJons into a roadside meadow and set up a camp, clappinJ hands round a
bonfire while  one of  them played a reel  on some small  bellows-powered
baJpipes, barely audible these many miles away. Then she reali]ed that the
book hadn't said anythinJ for a lonJ time. “What happened then?” she said.

       The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer said nothinJ.

       “Nell  looked for a safe way down,” Nell essayed.

       Her  vantaJe point beJan to move. A patch of  snow swunJ into  view.
“No, wait!”  she said, “Nell stuffed some clean snow into her water bottles.”

       ,n  the paintinJ, Nell  could see her bare pink hands scoopinJ up snow
and packinJ it bit  by bit  into the neck of  her bottle. When it  was full,  she
put the cork  back in (Nell  didn't  have to specify  that) and beJan movinJ
around on the rock, lookinJ for a place that wasn't so steep. Nell didn't have

344
to explain  that in  detail either;  in the  ractive, she searched the rock in  a
fairly rational  way and in a few minutes found a stairway chiseled into  the
rock, windinJ down the mountain endlessly until it pierced a cloud layer far
below. Princess Nell beJan descendinJ the steps, one at a time.

       After  a while,  Nell tried  an experiment: “Princess Nell descended the
stairs for many hours.”

       This triJJered a series of dissolves like she'd seen on old passives: Her
current view dissolved into a closeup of her feet, trudJinJ down a couple of
steps, which  dissolved into  a  view  from  considerably  farther down  the
mountain, followed  by  a closeup of  Princess Nell  unscrewinJ  her water
bottle and  drinkinJ  melted snow;  another view  from  farther  down; Nell
sittinJ down  for  a rest; a soarinJ  eaJle; the approachinJ cloud  layer; biJ
trees; descendinJ throuJh the mist; and finally, Nell trampinJ wearily down
the last ten steps, which left  her in  a clearinJ in  a dark coniferous forest,
carpeted with rust-colored  pine needles. ,t  was twiliJht,   and  the wolves
were beJinninJ to howl. Nell  made the usual arranJements for the niJht, lit
a fire, and curled up to sleep.

       HavinJ  reached a Jood stoppinJ-place, Nell started to close the book.
She'd have to continue this later.

       She had Must entered the land of the oldest and most powerful of all the
Faery KinJs.  The many  castles on the  mountains belonJed to  all  of  his
Dukes and Earls, and she suspected she would have to visit them all before
she had Jotten what she'd come for.  ,t  was not a  Tuick adventure for  an
early Saturday morninJ. But Must as she was claspinJ the book toJether, new
words and an  illustration  appeared on the  paJe she'd been readinJ,  and
somethinJ about the illustration made her open the book back up. ,t showed
a crow perched on a tree branch above Princess Nell, holdinJ a necklace in
its beak. ,t was eleven Meweled keys strunJ on a Jolden chain. Princess Nell
had been wearinJ it around her neck; apparently the next event in the story
was that this bird stole it while she was sleepinJ. Beneath the picture was a
poem, spoken by the crow from his perch:

345
 

            Castles, gardens, gold, and Mewels
            Contentment signify, for fools 
            Like Princess Nell; but those 
            Who cultivate their wit 
            Like King Coyote and his cr ows
            Compile their power bit by bit 
            And hide it places no one knows. 

 

Nell  closed up the book.  This was  too upsettinJ  to think  about Must now. She
had been  collectinJ   those keys  for   most  of  her life.   The  first  she'd  taken
from  KinJ  MaJpie  Must after she and Harv  had arrived  at Dovetail.   She had
picked  up the  other ten  one at  a time  durinJ  the  years since  then. She had
done this  by   travelinJ   to  the  lands of   the  Faery  KinJs   and 4ueens   who
owned  those  keys  and  usinJ  the  tricks   she  had  learned  from   her  NiJht
Friends. Each key  had come to her in  a different  way.

        One  of  the hardest  keys  to  Jet had  belonJed  to  an  old  Faery  4ueen
who  had seen throuJh  every  trick   that  Nell  could  think   up and  fouJht  off
every assault.  Finally,  in  desperation,  Princess  Nell  had  thrown  herself  on
the mercy of  that 4ueen  and  told her  the sad story  of Harv  locked  up in  the
Dark  Castle.  The  4ueen   had  fed  Nell   a nice  bowl   of  chicken   soup  and
handed over the key with  a smile.

        Not  much  later,  Duck   had encountered  a  nice  younJ  mallard   on the
road and  flown  away  with   him  to  start a  family.  Purple  and  Princess Nell
then traveled  toJether  for  several  years, and  on  many a  dark  niJht,  sittinJ
around the campfire  under a full   moon, Purple  had tauJht  Nell  secret thinJs
from her  maJic books  and from  the ancient lore  she kept in her head.

        Recently  they had traveled  for  a thousand miles  on camelback  across a
Jreat desert full   of dMinns, demons, sultans, and  caliphs and  finally   reached
the Jreat  onion-domed  palace  of  the local  Faery  KinJ—himself    a  dMinn of
Jreat power—who   ruled over  all  the desert lands. Princess Nell  had devised
a complicated   plan to  trick   their  way  into  the  dMinn's treasury. To carry   it

346
out, she and Purple had to live in the city around the palace for a couple of
years and make many  treks into  the  desert in search of  maJic  lanterns,
rinJs, secret caverns, and the like.

       Finally,  Princess Nell  and Purple  had penetrated to the dMinn kinJ's
treasury and found the eleventh  key. But  they had been surprised by the
dMinn himself, who attacked them in the Juise of  a fire-breathinJ  serpent.
Purple had transformed herself into a Jiant  eaJle with metallic  winJs  and
talons that could not be burned—much to the surprise of Princess Nell, who
had never imaJined that her companion possessed such power.

       The battle between Purple and the dMinn raJed for a day and a niJht,
both combatants transforminJ  themselves into any  number of  fantastical
creatures and hurlinJ all  manner of devastatinJ spells at each other, until
finally  the miJhty  castle lay in  ruins, the desert was scorched and blasted
for many miles around, and Purple and the dMinn kinJ both lay dead on the
floor of what had been the treasury.

       Nell  had picked up the eleventh key from the floor, put it on her chain,
cremated Purple's body, and scattered her ashes across the desert as she
walked, for many days, toward the mountains and the Jreen land, where the
eleven keys had now been stolen away from her.

 


                   Nell's experiences at school; a confrontation  with
                        Miss Stricken;  the rigors of Supplementary 
                       Curriculum;   Miss Matheson's philosophy of 
                         education; three friends go separate ways.

       THALIA                                                                                                   
                                                                        BLOOM

       The names of the three Jraces, and diverse artists' conceptions of the
ladies themselves, were chiseled, painted,  and sculpted freely  about  the
interior and exterior of  Miss Matheson's Academy. Nell could  hardly look
anywhere  without   seeinJ   one  of   them   prancinJ   across  a  field    of
wildflowers,  distributinJ  laurel  wreaths to the  worthy, Mointly thrustinJ  a
torch toward  heaven, or sheddinJ lambent effulJence  upon the  receptive
pupils.

       Nell's favorite  part of the curriculum was Thalia, which was scheduled
for  an hour  in  the  morninJ  and  an hour  in  the  afternoon. When  Miss
Matheson hauled once on the old bellrope danJlinJ down  from the belfry,
beltinJ a sinJle dolorous clanJ  across the campus, Nell and the other Jirls
in her section would arise, curtsy to their teacher, walk in sinJle  file down
the corridor  to  the  courtyard—then break  into  a  chaotic run  until   they
reached the Hall of  Physical Culture, where they  would strip  out of  their
heavy, scratchy  complicated   uniforms  and  climb   into   liJhter,   looser,
scratchy complicated uniforms with more freedom of movement.

       The Bloom  curriculum  was tauJht by Miss  RamanuMan or one of her
assistants. 8sually they did  somethinJ viJorous in  the morninJ,  like  field
hockey, and somethinJ Jraceful in  the afternoon, like  ballroom  dance, or
peculiar, JiJJle-inducinJ   exercises in how  to  walk,  stand, and sit  like  a
Lady.

       Brilliance  was Miss  Matheson's department, thouJh she mostly left it
to her assistants, occasionally wheelinJ in and out of various classrooms in
an old  wood-and-wicker  wheelchair. DurinJ  the  AJlaia  period, the  Jirls
would Jet toJether in  Jroups of half  a do]en or  so to answer Tuestions or
solve problems put to them by the teachers: For example, they counted how
many species of plants and animals could be found in one sTuare foot of the
forest behind the school. They put on a scene from a play  in Greek. They
used a ractive simulation to model the domestic economy of a Lakota band
before and after the introduction of horses. They desiJned simple machines

348
with a nanopresence riJ and tried to  compile them in  the M.C.  and make
them work. They wove brocades and made porcelain as Chinese ladies used
to do. And there was an ocean of history to be learned: first biblical, Greek,
and Roman, and then the history of many other  peoples around the world
that essentially served  as backdrop for  History   of  the EnJlish-SpeakinJ
Peoples.

       The latter subMect was, curiously, not part of the Brilliance curriculum;
it was left firmly  in the hands of Miss Stricken, who was mistress of -oy.

       ,n  addition to  two one-hour periods each day, Miss  Stricken had the
attention of the entire assembled student body once in the morninJ, once at
noon, and once in the eveninJ. DurinJ these times her basic function was to
call   the  students  to   order;   publicly   upbraid   those  sheep  who   had
prominently strayed  since the  last such  assembly; disJorJe any  random
meditations that  had  been occupyinJ  her  mind  of  late;  and  finally,   in
reverential tones, introduce Father Cox, the local vicar, who would lead the
students in prayer. Miss Stricken also had the students all to herself for two
hours on Sunday morninJ and could optionally command their attention for
up to eiJht  hours on Saturdays if she came round to the opinion that they
wanted supplementary Juidance.

       The first  time Nell  sat down in one of Miss Stricken's classrooms, she
found that her desk had perversely been left directly behind another Jirl's,
so that she was unable to see anythinJ except for the bow in that Jirl's hair.
She Jot up, tried to skooch the desk, and found that it was fixed to the floor.
All the desks, in fact, were arranJed in a perfectly reJular Jrid, facinJ in the
same direction—which is  to say, toward Miss  Stricken or one of  her two
assistants, Miss Bowlware and Mrs. Disher.

       Miss Bowlware  tauJht them History of  the EnJlish-SpeakinJ Peoples,
startinJ with the Romans at Londinium and careeninJ throuJh the Norman
ConTuest, MaJna Carta, Wars of the Roses, Renaissance, and Civil War; but
she didn't really hit her stride until she Jot to the GeorJian period, at which
point she worked herself up into a froth explaininJ the shortcominJs of that
syphilitic  monarch,  which  had inspired  the  riJht-thinkinJ   Americans  to

349
break away in  disJust.  They studied  the most  Jhastly parts  of Dickens,
which Miss  Bowlware  carefully  explained was called Victorian  literature
because it was written durinJ the reiJn of Victoria ,, but was actually about
pre-Victorian times, and that the mores of the oriJinal Victorians—the ones
who built the old  British Empire—were  actually a reaction aJainst the sort
of  bad behavior  enJaJed  in  by  their  parents and  Jrandparents and  so
convincinJly detailed by Dickens, their most popular novelist.

       The  Jirls  actually  Jot  to sit  at  their  desks and play  a few  ractives
showinJ what it  was like to  live  durinJ this time:  Jenerally not very  nice,
even if you selected the option that turned off all the diseases. At this point,
Mrs. Disher stepped in to  say, if you  thouJht that was scary, look  at how
poor people lived  in the late  twentieth century. ,ndeed, after ractives told
them about the  life  of  an  inner-city  WashinJton, D.C.,  child  durinJ  the
1990s, most students had to aJree they'd take a workhouse in pre-Victorian
EnJland over that any day.

       All    of  the   foreJoinJ  set  the   staJe for   a  three-pronJed,  parallel
examination of the British  Empire; pre-Vietnam America;  and the modern
and onJoinJ history  of New  Atlantis. ,n  Jeneral, Mrs. Disher  handled the
more modern stuff and anythinJ pertaininJ to America.

       Miss  Stricken handled the biJ payoff at the end of  each period and at
the end of each unit. She stormed in to explain what conclusion they were
beinJ led to and to make sure that all of them Jot it. She also had a way of
lunJinJ predatorily  into the classroom and rappinJ the knuckles of any Jirl
who had  been whisperinJ,  makinJ  faces at  the  teachers, passinJ notes,
doodlinJ,  woolJatherinJ,  fidJetinJ,  scratchinJ,  nose-pickinJ,  siJhinJ,  or
slumpinJ.

       Clearly,  she was sittinJ  in  her  closetlike  office  next door  watchinJ
them with cine monitors. Once, Nell was sittinJ in  -oy diliJently  absorbinJ
a lecture about the Lend-Lease ProJram. When she heard the sTueaky door
from Miss  Stricken's office swinJ  open behind her, like all  the other Jirls
she suppressed the panicky urJe to look around. She heard Miss Stricken's

350
heels poppinJ up her aisle, heard the whir  of the ruler, and then suddenly
felt her knuckles explode.

       “HairdressinJ  is a  private not  a public  activity, Nell,”   Miss Stricken
said. “The other Jirls know this; now you do too.”

       Nell's   face  burned, and  she  wrapped  her  Jood  hand  around  her
damaJed one like a bandaJe. She did not understand anythinJ until one of
the other Jirls  cauJht her eye  and made a corkscrewinJ motion  with  her
index finJer up near one temple: Apparently Nell had been twistinJ her hair
around her finJer, which she often did when she was readinJ the Primer or
thinkinJ hard about any one thinJ.

       The  ruler was such a  pissant form of  discipline,  compared to a  real
beatinJ, that she could  not take it  seriously at  first  and actually  found it
funny the first few  times. As the months went by, thouJh, it  seemed to Jet
more painful.  Either  Nell  was  becominJ soft,  or—more  likely—the  full
dimensions of the punishment were beJinninJ to sink in. She had been such
an outsider at first that nothinJ  mattered. But as she beJan to excel in the
other classes and to Jain  the respect of  teachers and students alike,  she
found herself  with  pride  to  lose. Part  of  her wanted  to  rebel, to  throw
everythinJ away so that it  could not  be used aJainst her. But she enMoyed
the other classes so much  that she  couldn't bear  to think  further  of  the
possibility.

       One  day Miss  Stricken decided  to concentrate all  her attentions on
Nell. There was nothinJ  unusual about that—it was standard to randomly
sinJle  out  particular   scholars for   intensive  enforcement.  With   twenty
minutes left in the hour, Miss Stricken had already Jotten Nell on the riJht
hand for hair-twistinJ  and on  the left  for nail-bitinJ,   when, to her horror,
Nell reali]ed  that she was scratchinJ her nose and that Miss Stricken was
standinJ in the aisle JlarinJ  at her like a falcon.  Both of  Nell's hands shot
into her lap, beneath the desk.

       Miss Stricken  walked up to her deliberately, pop pop pop. “Your riJht
hand, Nell,” she said, “Must about here.” And she indicated with the end of

351
the ruler an altitude that would be a convenient place for the assault—rather
hiJh above the desk, so that everyone in the room could see it.

       Nell  hesitated for a moment, then held her hand up.

       “A  bit hiJher, Nell,”  Miss Stricken said.

       Nell  moved her hand a bit hiJher.

       “Another  inch should do it, , think,”  Miss Stricken said, appraisinJ the
hand as if it  were carved in  marble and recently excavated from a  Greek
temple.

       Nell  could not brinJ herself to raise the hand any hiJher.

       “Raise it  one more inch, Nell,”   Miss Stricken said, “so  that the other
Jirls can observe and learn alonJ with you.”

       Nell  raised her hand Must a bit.

       “That  was rather less than an inch, , should think,” Miss Stricken said.

       Other Jirls in  the class beJan to titter—their faces were all turned back
toward Nell, and she could see their exultation, and somehow Miss Stricken
and the ruler became irrelevant compared to the other Jirls. Nell raised her
hand a whole inch, saw the windup out of  the corner of her eye, heard the
whir. At  the last moment, on an impulse, she flipped her hand over, cauJht
the ruler on her palm, Jrabbed it, and twisted in a way that DoMo had tauJht
her, bendinJ it aJainst the Jrain of  Miss Stricken's finJers  so that she was
forced to let Jo. Now Nell had the ruler, and Miss Stricken was disarmed.

       Her opponent was a bulJinJ sort of woman, taller  than averaJe, rather
topheavy on those heels, the sort of teacher whose very fleshiness becomes
the obMect of morbid awe amonJ her Jamine pupils, whose personal toilet
practices—the penchant for dandruff, the habitually  worn-out lipstick,  the
little wad of conJealed saliva at the corner of the mouth—loom larJer in her
students' minds than the Great Pyramids or the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

352
Like  all  other  women, Miss  Stricken  benefited from  a  lack  of  external
Jenitalia that would make it  more difficult  for  Nell to  incapacitate her, but
nevertheless, Nell could think of  half  a do]en ways to  leave her a bloody
knot on  the floor  and not  waste more than  a Tuarter of  a minute  in  the
process. DurinJ her  time  with  Constable Moore,  notinJ  her benefactor's
interest in war and weapons, she had taken up a renewed interest in martial
arts, had paJed back in the Primer to the Dinosaur's Tale and been pleased
but hardly surprised to  discover that DoMo was still holdinJ lessons there,
pickinJ up Must where he and Belle the Monkey had left off.

       ThinkinJ  of  her friend Dinosaur and her sensei, DoMo the Mouse, she
suddenly  felt  shame  far   deeper than   anythinJ  Miss   Stricken  or   her
sniJJerinJ classmates could inflict. Miss Stricken was a stupid haJ, and her
classmates were snot-nosed clowns,  but  DoMo was her  friend   and her
teacher, he had always respected her and Jiven her his full attention, and he
had carefully tauJht her the ways of humility   and self-discipline. Now she
had perverted his teachinJs by usinJ her skill to take Miss Stricken's ruler.
She could not have been more ashamed.

       She handed the ruler back, raised her hand hiJh in  the air, and heard
but did not feel the impacts of the ruler, some ten in all. “, shall expect you
in my office  after eveninJ prayers, Nell,” Miss Stricken said when she was
finished.

       “Yes, Miss Stricken,” Nell  said.

       “What  are you Jirls lookinJ at?” blurted Mrs. Disher, who was runninJ
the class today. “Turn around and pay attention!”  And with  that it  was all
over. Nell sat in her desk for  the rest of the hour as if  carved from a solid
block of Jypsum.

       Her interview  with  Miss Stricken at the end of  the day was short and
businesslike, no violence or  even histrionics.  Nell  was informed  that her
performance in the  -oy  phase of  the curriculum  was so  deficient that  it
placed her  in   danJer  of   failinJ   and  beinJ  expelled  from   the  school

353
altoJether, and that her only hope was to come in  each Saturday for eiJht
hours of supplementary study.

       Nell  wished more than  anythinJ that she could  refuse. Saturday was
the only day of the week when she did not have to attend school at all. She
always spent the day readinJ the  Primer, explorinJ  the fields  and forests
around Dovetail, or visitinJ Harv down in the Leased Territories.

       She felt that, throuJh her own mistakes, she had ruined her life at Miss
Matheson's Academy. 8ntil    recently,  Miss  Stricken's  classes had been
nothinJ  more than  a  routine  annoyance—an ordeal that  she had  to  sit
throuJh in  order to experience the fun parts of  the curriculum.  She could
look back on  a time only  a couple of  months aJo when  she would come
home with her mind aJlow from all the thinJs she had learned in Brilliance,
and when the -oy part was Must an indistinct smudJe around the edJe. But in
recent weeks, Miss Stricken had, for some reason, loomed larJer and larJer
in her view of the place. And somehow, Miss Stricken had read Nell's mind
and  had  chosen Must the riJht   moment  to   step  up  her  campaiJn  of
harassment. She had timed today's events perfectly. She had brouJht Nell's
most deeply  hidden  feelinJs  out  into   the open,  like   a master  butcher
exposinJ the innards with  one or two  deft  strokes of the knife.  And  now
everythinJ was ruined. Now  Miss Matheson's Academy had vanished and
become Miss Stricken's House of Pain, and there was no way  for  Nell to
escape from that house without JivinJ up, which  her friends in  the Primer
had tauJht her she must never do.

       Nell's name went up on a board at the front of the classroom labeled, in
heavy brass letters,  S8PPLEMENTARY    C8RRIC8L8M     ST8DENTS.
Within  a  few  days,  her  name  had  been Moined by two   others:  Fiona
Hackworth and Eli]abeth Finkle-McGraw. Nell's  disarminJ of the fearsome
Miss Stricken  had already become the stuff  of  oral  leJend, and her  two
friends had been so inspired by the  act of defiance that  they had Jone to
elaborate lenJths to  Jet  themselves in  trouble  too. Now,  the  three best
students of Miss Matheson's Academy were all doomed to Supplementary
Curriculum.

354
       Each Saturday, Nell, Fiona, and Eli]abeth would arrive at the school at
seven o'clock, enter the room,  and sit  down in  the front  row  in  adMacent
desks. This  was  part  of   Miss  Stricken's  fiendish   plan.  A  less  subtle
tormentor would have placed the  Jirls  as far apart as possible to  prevent
them from talkinJ  to each other, but Miss Stricken wanted them riJht next
to each other so that they would be more tempted to visit and pass notes.

       There was no teacher in the room at any time. They assumed that they
were beinJ monitored, but they never really knew. When they entered, each
one of them had a pile  of books on her desk—old  books bound in chafed
leather. Their Mob was to copy the books out by hand and leave the paJes
neatly stacked on Miss Stricken's desk before they went home. 8sually, the
books were  transcripts of   debates from  the  House of  Lords,  from   the
nineteenth century.

       DurinJ  their seventh Saturday in Supplementary Curriculum, Eli]abeth
Finkle-McGraw  suddenly dropped her  pen, slammed her book  shut, and
threw it aJainst the wall.

       Nell   and  Fiona   could  not   keep  themselves  from  lauJhinJ.   But
Eli]abeth  did not  convey  the impression of  beinJ  in  a very  liJhthearted
mood. The old book had scarcely come to rest on the floor before Eli]abeth
had run over to it  and beJun kickinJ at  it. With  each blow a furious Jrunt
escaped from her  JorJe.  The  book  absorbed this  violence impassively,
drivinJ  Eli]abeth  into  a hiJher raJe;  she dropped to her knees, flunJ  the
cover open, and beJan to rip out paJes by the fistful.

       Nell  and Fiona looked at each other, suddenly serious. The kickinJ had
been funny, but somethinJ about the tearinJ of paJes disturbed them both.
“Eli]abeth!  Stop it!”  Nell  said, but Eli]abeth Jave no siJns of havinJ heard
her. Nell ran up to Eli]abeth and huJJed her from behind. Fiona scurried in
a moment later and picked up the book.

       “God  damn  it!”   Eli]abeth  bellowed, “,   don't  care about any  of  the
Joddamn books, and , don't care about the Primer either!”

355
       The door banJed open. Miss Stricken stomped in, dislodJed Nell with
a simple  body  check, Jot   both arms  around Eli]abeth's   shoulders, and
manhandled her out the door.

       A  few days later, Eli]abeth left on a lenJthy vacation with her parents,
MumpinJ from one New  Atlantis  clave to  another in  the family's  private
airship, workinJ their way across the Pacific and North America and finally
to London itself,  where they settled in for  several months. ,n the first few
days, Nell received one letter from her, and Fiona received two. After  that
they received no  response to their  letters and eventually  stopped tryinJ.
Eli]abeth's name was removed from the Supplementary Curriculum plaTue.

       Nell  and  Fiona soldiered on.  Nell  had reached the point  where she
could transcribe the old  books all  day  lonJ  without  actually absorbinJ a
sinJle word. DurinJ  her first  weeks in Supplementary Curriculum she had
been friJhtened; in fact, she had been surprised at the level of her own fear
and had  come  to  reali]e   that  Authority,  even  when  it   refrained from
violence, could be as disturbinJ a specter as anythinJ she had seen in her
earlier years. After the incident with Eli]abeth,  she became bored for many
months, then furious for  Tuite a while  until  she reali]ed, in  conversations
with Duck  and Purple, that her anJer was eatinJ her up  inside. So with  a
conscious effort, she went back to beinJ bored aJain.

       The reason she'd been furious was that copyinJ  out those books was
such an unforJivably stupid  waste of time. There was no end to  what she
could have learned readinJ the Primer for those eiJht hours. For that matter,
the normal  curriculum   at Miss   Matheson's Academy  would  have been
perfectly fine as well. She was tormented by the irrationality of this place.

       One  day, when she returned from  a  trip  to  the washroom, she was
startled to notice  that Fiona had hardly  copied out  a sinJle  paJe, thouJh
they had been there for hours.

       After  this, Nell  made it a practice to look  at Fiona from time  to time.
She noticed  that Fiona  never  stopped writinJ,   but  she was  not payinJ
attention to the old books. As she finished each paJe, she folded it up and

356
placed it  in  her  reticule.  From time  to  time,  she  would  stop and  stare
dreamily out the window for  a few minutes, and then resume; or she miJht
place both hands over her face and rock back and forth silently in her chair
for a while before JivinJ  herself over to  a lonJ burst of ardent writinJ  that
miJht cover several paJes in as many minutes.

       Miss  Stricken cruised into the room late one afternoon, took the stack
of completed paJes from Nell's desk, flipped throuJh them, and allowed her
chin to decline by a few minutes of arc. This nearly imperceptible vestiJe of
a nod was her way of sayinJ that Nell was dismissed for the day. Nell had
come to understand that one way for Miss Stricken to emphasi]e her power
over the Jirls  was for her to  make her wishes known throuJh  the subtlest
possible siJns, so that her charJes were forced to watch her anxiously at all
times.

       Nell  took her leave; but after proceedinJ a few steps down the corridor,
she turned and stole back to the door and peeked throuJh the window into
the classroom.

       Miss  Stricken had Jotten the folded-up  paJes out of Fiona's baJ and
was perusinJ them, strollinJ back and forth across the front of the room like
the slow swinJ of a pendulum, a devastatinJly ponderous motion. Fiona sat
in her chair, her head bowed and her shoulders drawn toJether protectively.

       After  readinJ the papers for an eternity or two, Miss Stricken dropped
them on her desk and made some kind of brief statement, shakinJ her head
in hopeless disbelief. Then she turned and walked out of the room.

       When Nell  reached her, Fiona's shoulders were still  shakinJ silently.
Nell  put her  arms around Fiona,  who  finally  beJan  to draw  in  sobbinJ
breaths. DurinJ the next few minutes she Jradually moved on to that staJe
of cryinJ where the body seems to swell up and poach in its own fluids.

       Nell  suppressed the urJe to be impatient. She well knew, as did all of
the other Jirls,  that Fiona's father  had disappeared several years aJo and
never come back.  He  was rumored  to  be on  an honorable  and official
mission; but as years went by this  belief was Jradually  supplanted by the

357
suspicion that  somethinJ disJraceful  had taken  place. ,t  would  be  easy
enouJh for Nell  to make the point that she had been throuJh much worse.
But  seeinJ the  depth  of  Fiona's  unhappiness, she had  to  consider the
possibility that Fiona was in a worse situation now.

       When Fiona's mother came by in  a little  half-lane car to pick  her up,
and saw her dauJhter's red and ruinous face, an expression of black  raJe
came over her own visaJe and she drove Fiona away without so much as a
Jlance at Nell. Fiona showed up for  church the next day as if nothinJ  had
happened and said nothinJ of it to Nell  durinJ the next week at school. ,n
fact, Fiona hardly said a word to  anyone, as she spent all of her time now
daydreaminJ.

       When  Nell and  Fiona showed up at seven o'clock  the next Saturday
morninJ, they were astonished to find Miss  Matheson waitinJ  for them at
the front   of  the  classroom, sittinJ  in   her wood-and-wicker  wheelchair,
wrapped up in  a thermoJenic comforter. The  stacks of books, paper, and
fountain pens were not there, and their names had been removed from the
plaTue at the front of the room.  “,t's  a lovely sprinJ  day,” Miss  Matheson
said. “Let's Jather some foxJloves.”

       They   went  across  the  playinJ   fields  to   the  meadow  where  the
wildflowers  Jrew, the two  Jirls  walkinJ  and Miss  Matheson's wheelchair
carryinJ her alonJ on its many-spoked smart wheels.

       “Chiselled Spam,” Miss Matheson said, sort of mumblinJ it to herself.

       “Pardon me, Miss Matheson?” Nell said.

       “,    was   Must watchinJ   the   smart  wheels   and  rememberinJ   an
advertisement from  my  youth,”   Miss  Matheson  said.  “,   used to  be  a
thrasher, you know. , used to ride skateboards throuJh the streets. Now ,'m
still on wheels, but a different kind. Got a few too many bumps and bruises
durinJ my earlier career, ,'m afraid.”

“,t's a wonderful  thinJ to  be clever, and you should never think otherwise,
and you should never stop beinJ that way. But what  you learn, as you Jet
older, is that there are a few billion other people in the world all tryinJ to be
clever at the same time, and whatever you do with your life will certainly be
lost—swallowed up in the ocean—unless you are doinJ it alonJ with  like-
minded people  who  will   remember  your  contributions  and carry  them
forward. That is why the world is divided into tribes. There are many Lesser
phyles and three Great ones. What are the Great ones?”

       “New  Atlantis,”  Nell beJan.

       “Nippon,”  said Fiona.

       “Han,”  they concluded toJether.

       “That  is correct,”  Miss Matheson said. “We traditionally  include  Han
in the list  because of its immense si]e and aJe—even thouJh it  has lately
been crippled by  intestine  discord. And  some would  include  Hindustan,
while others would view  it  as a riotously diverse collection  of microtribes
sintered toJether accordinJ to some formula we don't Jet.

       “Now,  there was a  time when  we believed that  what a human mind
could accomplish was determined by Jenetic factors. Piffle, of course, but it
looked convincinJ for many years, because distinctions between tribes were
so evident. Now we understand that it's all cultural. That, after all, is what a
culture is—a Jroup of people who share in common certain acTuired traits.

       “,nformation   technoloJy   has freed  cultures  from  the  necessity  of
owninJ  particular  bits  of  land in   order to  propaJate; now  we  can  live
anywhere. The Common  Economic Protocol  specifies how  this  is  to be
arranJed.

       “Some  cultures are  prosperous; some are not.  Some value  rational
discourse and the scientific method; some do not. Some encouraJe freedom
of expression, and some discouraJe it. The only thinJ they have in common
is that if  they do not  propaJate, they will  be swallowed up by  others. All
they have built  up will  be torn  down; all  they have accomplished will  be

359
forJotten; all they have learned and written will be scattered to the wind. ,n
the old days it was easy to remember this because of the constant necessity
of border defence. Nowadays, it is all too easily forJotten.

       “New   Atlantis,  like   many  tribes,  propaJates itself  larJely  throuJh
education. That is  the raison  d'Être of  this  Academy. Here  you develop
your bodies throuJh exercise and dance, and your minds by doinJ proMects.
And  then you  Jo  to  Miss   Stricken's class.  What  is  the point  of   Miss
Stricken's class? Anyone? Please speak up. You  can't Jet  in  trouble, no
matter what you say.”

       Nell  said, after  some ditherinJ,  “,'m  not sure that  it  has any point.”
Fiona Must watched her sayinJ it and smiled sadly.

       Miss  Matheson smiled. “You are not far off  the mark. Miss Stricken's
phase of the curriculum  comes perilously close to beinJ  without  any real
substance. Why do we bother with it, then?”

       “,  can't imaJine,” Nell said.

       “When  ,  was  a child,   ,  took  a karate class,”  Miss  Matheson said,
astonishinJly. “Dropped out after a few  weeks. Couldn't stand it. , thouJht
that the sensei would teach me how to defend myself when , was out on my
skateboard. But the first thinJ he did was have me sweep the floor. Then he
told me that if ,  wanted to defend myself, , should buy a Jun. ,  came back
the next week and  he had me sweep the floor  aJain.  All  ,  ever did  was
sweep. Now, what was the point of that?”

       “To  teach you humility and self-discipline,” Nell  said. She had learned
this from DoMo lonJ aJo.

       “Precisely. Which  are moral Tualities. ,t is upon moral Tualities that a
society  is   ultimately   founded.   All    the  prosperity   and   technoloJical
sophistication in the world is of no use without that foundation—we learned
this in  the late twentieth  century, when it  became unfashionable to teach
these thinJs.”

360
       “But   how can  you say  it's moral?”  said Fiona.  “Miss  Stricken  isn't
moral. She's so cruel.”

       “Miss  Stricken is not someone , would invite  to dinner at my house. ,
would not hire her as a Joverness for my children. Her methods are not my
methods. But people like her are indispensable.

       “,t  is the hardest thinJ in  the world to  make educated Westerners pull
toJether,” Miss  Matheson went on.  “That  is the  Mob of people like Miss
Stricken. We must forJive them their imperfections. She is like an avatar—
do you children know  about avatars? She is the physical embodiment of a
principle. That principle  is that outside the comfortable and well-defended
borders of our phyle is a hard world that will come and hurt us if we are not
careful. ,t  is  not  an easy Mob to have. We  must all  feel  sorry  for  Miss
Stricken.”

       They  brouJht sheaves of foxJloves,  violet  and maJenta, back to the
school and set them in vases in each classroom, leavinJ an especially larJe
bouTuet in Miss Stricken's office. Then they took tea with Miss  Matheson,
and then they each went home.

       Nell  could  not brinJ  herself to  aJree with  what Miss  Matheson had
said; but she found  that, after this  conversation, everythinJ became easy.
She  had  the   neo-Victorians  all    fiJured   out   now.  The   society   had
miraculously   transmutated into    an  orderly    system,  like   the   simple
computers they proJrammed in the school. Now that  Nell knew  all of  the
rules, she could make it do anythinJ she wanted.

       “-oy”   returned  to its  former  position  as a minor  annoyance on  the
frinJes of a wonderful schoolday. Miss Stricken Jot her with the ruler from
time to time, but not nearly so often, even when she was, in fact, scratchinJ
or slumpinJ.

       Fiona  Hackworth  had a  harder time  of   it,  and within   a  couple of
months she was back on the Supplementary Curriculum list. A few months
after that, she stopped cominJ to school entirely. ,t was announced that she

361
and her mother had moved to Atlantis/Seattle, and her address was posted
in the hall for those who wished to write her letters.

       But  Nell   heard rumors about  Fiona  from  the other  Jirls,  who  had
picked up snatches from their parents. After Fiona had been Jone for a year
or so, word Jot out  that Fiona's mother had obtained a divorce—which, in
their tribe, only happened in cases of adultery or abuse. Nell wrote Fiona a
lonJ letter sayinJ she was terribly sorry if  her father had been abusive, and
offerinJ her support in that case. A few  days later she Jot back a curt note
in which  Fiona  defended her father from  all  charJes. Nell  wrote  back a
letter of apoloJy but didn't hear from Fiona Hackworth aJain.

       ,t   was  about two   years later  that   the news  feeds  filled   up  with
astonishinJ tales of the younJ heiress Eli]abeth  Finkle-McGraw, who  had
vanished from her family's  estate outside of London  and was rumored to
have been siJhted in London, Los AnJeles, HonJ KonJ, Miami,  and many
other places, in  the presence of  people suspected of beinJ  hiJh-rankinJ
members of CryptNet.


                  Hackworth  awakes from a dream; retreat from the
                world of the Drummers;  chronological  discrepancies. 



Hackworth woke  from  a dream of  unsustainable pleasure and reali]ed it
wasn't a dream; his penis was inside  someone else, and he was steaminJ
like a  runaway locomotive  toward eMaculation. He had no idea what was
JoinJ on;  but couldn't  he be forJiven  for  doinJ the  wronJ thinJ?  With  a
wiJJle here and a thrust there, he finally nudJed himself over the threshold,
the smooth muscles of the tract in Tuestion executinJ their spinal alJorithm.

       -ust a few  deep breaths into the refractory period, and he had already
disenJaJed, yelpinJ  a  little  from   the electric  spark  of  withdrawal,  and
levered himself up on one arm to see whom he'd Must violated. The fireliJht
was enouJh to tell him what he already knew: Whoever this woman was, it
wasn't Gwen. Hackworth had violated the most important promise he'd ever
made, and he didn't even know the other party.

362
       But he knew it wasn't the first time. Far from it. He'd had sex with a lot
of people in the past few years—he'd even been buggered.

       There was, for example, the woman—

       Never mind, there was the man who—

       StranJe to  say, he could not  think  of any  specific examples. But  he
knew he was  Juilty.  ,t  was precisely  like  wakinJ  up  from  a dream and
havinJ a clear train of thouJht  in your mind,  somethinJ you were workinJ
on Must a few seconds aJo, but beinJ unable to remember it, consciousness
peeled away from  coJnition.  Like  a  three-year-old who  has a talent  for
vanishinJ into crowds whenever you turn your back, Hackworth's memories
had fled  to the  same place as words that are  on the  tip of  your  tonJue,
precedents for déMà vu, last niJht's dreams.

       He knew  he was in biJ  trouble with  Gwen, but  that Fiona still  loved
him—Fiona, taller than Gwen  now, so self-conscious about her still linear
fiJure, still devoid of the second derivatives that add spice to life.

       Taller than Gwen? How's that?

       Better  Jet out of  this  place before he had sex with  someone else he
didn't know.

       He wasn't in the central chamber anymore, rather in one of the tunnel's
aneurysms with some twenty other people, all Must as naked as he was. He
knew which tunnel led to the exit (why?) and beJan to crawl down it, rather
stiffly as it seemed that he was stiff and laden with cricks and cramps. Must
not have been very athletic sex—more in the Tantric mode.

       Sometimes they had sex for days.

       How did  he know that?

       The hallucinations  were Jone, which  was fine with  him.  He crawled
throuJh the tunnels for a lonJ time. ,f  he tried to think about where he was

363
JoinJ, he  Jot lost  and eventually  circled back  to where he  started. Only
when his mind  beJan to  wander did  he make  his way  on some kind  of
autopilot to a lonJ  chamber filled  with silvery  liJht,  slopinJ  upward. This
was beJinninJ to look familiar,  he had seen this when he was still a younJ
man. He followed   it  upward until  he  reached the end, where somethinJ
unusually stony was under his feet. A hatch opened above him, and several
tons of cold seawater landed on his head.

       He  staJJered up  onto dry  land  and  found himself  in  Stanley  Park
aJain, Jray floor  aft,  Jreen wall  fore.  The ferns  rustled, and out stepped
Kidnapper, who looked fu]]y   and Jreen. He also looked unusually dapper
for a robotic  horse, as Hackworth's bowler hat was perched on top  of his
head.

       Hackworth  reached up to feel  himself and was astounded to feel his
face covered with hair. Several months' Jrowth of beard was there. But even
stranJer, his chest was much hairier than it  had been before. Some of the
chest hair was Jray, the only Jray hairs he had ever seen cominJ out of his
own follicles.

       Kidnapper  was fu]]y   and Jreen because moss had been JrowinJ on
him. The bowler looked terrible and had moss on it too. Hackworth reached
out instinctively and put it on his head. His arm was thicker and hairier than
it used to be,  a not altoJether unpleasinJ chanJe, and even the hat  felt  a
little tiJht.


                  From  the Primer, Princess Nell crosses the trail of
                    the enigmatic Mouse Army;  a visit to an invalid.

She'd have to see about the  Mouse Army   later. Today  was Saturday, and on
Saturday morninJ   she always  went  down  to  the Leased  Territories  to  visit
her brother. She opened up  the wardrobe  in the  corner of  her sleepinJ  room
and took out  her travelinJ   dress. SensinJ her  intentions,  the chaperone flew
out of its  niche in  the back and whined  over to  the door.

368
       Even  at her  still-tender  aJe, Must a few years past the  threshold of
womanhood, Nell had already had cause to be Jrateful for the presence of
the droninJ chaperone pod that followed her everywhere when she ventured
from home alone. Maturity had Jiven her any number of features that would
draw  the  attention  of   the  opposite  sex,  and  of   women  so   inclined.
Commentators rarely failed to mention her eyes, which were said to have a
vaJuely exotic  appearance. There was nothinJ particularly  unusual about
their shape or  si]e,  and their  color—a  tweedy  blend of  Jreen  and liJht
brown flecked with Jold—did  not make them stand out in a predominantly
AnJlo-Saxon culture. But  Nell's eyes had an appearance of feral alertness
that sei]ed  the  attention of  anyone who  met  her. Neo-Victorian  society
produced many younJ women who, thouJh hiJhly educated and well-read,
were still  blank slates at Nell's aJe. But  Nell's  eyes told a different  story.
When she had been presented to  society a  few  months aJo, alonJ  with
several other External PropaJation Jirls at Miss Matheson's Academy, she
had not been the prettiest Jirl at the dance, and certainly not the best dressed
or  most socially   prominent. She  had  attracted a  crowd  of  younJ  men
anyway. They did not  do anythinJ so obvious  as mill  around her; instead
they tried to keep the distance between themselves and Nell below a certain
maximum, so that wherever she went in the ballroom, the local  density of
younJ men in her area became unusually hiJh.

       ,n  particular she had excited the interest of a boy who was the nephew
of an ETuity  Lord  in  Atlantis/Toronto. He  had written  her several ardent
letters. She had responded sayinJ that  she did  not  wish to  continue  the
relationship, and  he  had,  perhaps with   the help  of   a  hidden  monitor,
encountered her and her chaperone pod one morninJ as she had been ridinJ
to  Miss   Matheson's Academy.  She  had  reminded  him   of   the  recent
termination of their  relationship by declininJ  to recoJni]e  him, but he had
persisted anyway,  and by   the  time  she had  reached  the  Jates of   the
Academy, the chaperone pod had Jathered enouJh evidence to support a
formal sexual harassment accusation should Nell have wished to brinJ one.

       Of  course she did  not,  because this would  have created a cloud  of
opprobrium that would  have bliJhted the younJ man's career. ,nstead, she
excerpted one five-second piece of the cine record from the chaperone pod:

369
the one in which, approached by the younJ man, Nell said, “,'m  sorry, but
,'m afraid  you have me at a disadvantaJe,” and the younJ man, failinJ   to
appreciate the ramifications, pressed on as if he had not heard. Nell placed
this information into  a smart visitinJ  card and arranJed to have it dropped
by the  younJ  man's  family   home. A   formal  apoloJy  was  not  lonJ  in
cominJ, and she did not hear aJain from the younJ man.

       Now  that she had  been introduced to society, her preparations for  a
visit to the Leased Territories were Must as elaborate as for any New Atlantis
lady. Outside  of  New  Atlantis,  she  and her  chevaline were  surrounded
everywhere by a shell of  hoverinJ security  pods servinJ as a first  line  of
personal defense. A modern lady's chevaline was desiJned with a sort of Y-
shaped body that made it unnecessary to ride sidesaddle, so Nell was able to
wear a fairly normal-lookinJ  sort of  dress: a bodice that took advantaJe of
her fashionably narrow waist, so carefully honed on the Academy's exercise
machines that it miJht  have been turned on a lathe  from walnut.  Beyond
that, her skirts,  sleeves, collar, and hat saw  to it  that  none of  the younJ
ruffians of the Leased Territories would have the opportunity to invade her
body space with their eyes, and lest her distinctive face prove too much of a
temptation, she wore a veil too.

       The   veil    was   a   field    of    microscopic,   umbrellalike    aerostats
proJrammed to fly in a sheet formation a few inches in front of Nell's  face.
The umbrellas were all pointed away from her. Normally they were furled,
which  made them nearly  invisible;  they  looked  like  the  merest shadow
before her  face, thouJh  viewed  sideways they  created a subtle  wall  of
shimmer in  the air.  At  a command from  Nell  they  would  open to  some
deJree. When fully   open, they  nearly  touched each other.  The outside-
facinJ surfaces were reflective, the  inner ones matte black, so Nell  could
see out as if she were lookinJ throuJh a piece of smoked Jlass. But others
saw only  the  shimmerinJ  veil.  The  umbrellas could  be proJrammed  to
danJle in  different ways—always  maintaininJ  the same collective shape,
like a fencinJ  mask, or ripplinJ  like  a sheet of fine silk,  dependinJ on the
current mode.

370
       The veil  offered  Nell protection  from unwanted scrutiny. Many  New
Atlantis career women also used the veil as a way of meetinJ the world on
their own terms, ensurinJ that they were MudJed on their own merits and not
on their appearance. ,t served a protective function as well, bouncinJ back
the harmful rays of the sun and interceptinJ many deleterious nanosites that
miJht otherwise slip unhindered into the nose and mouth.

       The latter  function  was of particular  concern to Constable Moore on
this morninJ. “,t's  been nasty of late,” he said. “The fiJhtinJ  has been very
bad.”  Nell   had already  inferred   this  from   certain  peculiarities  of  the
Constable's behavior:  he  had  been  stayinJ  up   late  at  niJht   recently,
manaJinJ some complicated enterprise spread out across his mediatronic
floor, and she suspected that it was somethinJ alonJ the lines of a battle or
even a war.

       As  she rode her chevaline across Dovetail,  she came to a heiJht-of-
land that afforded a  fine view  across the Leased Territories, PudonJ, and
ShanJhai on a  clear day. But  the  humidity  had conJealed into  drifts   of
clouds forminJ a seamless layer about a thousand feet below their level, so
that this hiJh territory at the top of New Chusan seemed to be an island, the
only land in  all  the world  except for the snowcapped cone of the Nippon
Clave a few miles up the coast.

       She departed throuJh the main Jate and rode down the hill.  She kept
approachinJ the cloud layer but never Tuite reached it; the lower she went,
the softer the liJht became, and after a few minutes she could no lonJer see
the ramblinJ settlements of Dovetail when she turned around, nor the spires
of  St. Mark's  and Source  Victoria  above it.  After   another few  minutes'
descent the foJ became so thick  that she could  not see more than a  few
meters, and she smelled the elemental reek of  the ocean. She passed the
former site of the Sendero Clave. The Senderos had been bloodily uprooted
when Protocol Enforcement fiJured out that they  were workinJ  in concert
with the New TaipinJ Rebels, a fanatical cult opposed to both the Fists and
the Coastal Republic. This  patch of  real estate had since passed into the
hands of  the DonJ,   an ethnic  minority   tribe  from  southwestern China,

371
driven out of their homeland by the civil  war. They had torn down the hiJh
wall and thrown up one of their distinctive many-layered paJodas.

       Other than that, the L.T. didn't look  all that different. The operators of
the biJ wall-si]e  mediatrons that had so terrified  Nell on  her first niJht  in
the Leased Territories had turned the briJhtness all  the way up,  tryinJ  to
compensate for the foJ.

       Down  by the waterfront, not far from the Aerodrome, the compilers of
New Chusan had, as a charitable Jesture, made some space available to the
Vatican. ,n the early years it had contained nothinJ more  than a two-story
mission for thetes who had followed their lifestyle  to its loJical  conclusion
and found themselves homeless, addicted, hounded by debtors, or on the
run from the law or abusive members of their own families.

       More  recently those had become secondary functions, and the Vatican
had proJrammed the buildinJ's  foundation to  extrude many more stories.
The Vatican had a number of serious ethical concerns about nanotech but
had eventually decided that it was okay as lonJ as it didn't mess about with
DNA  or create direct interfaces with  the human brain. 8sinJ   nanotech to
extrude   buildinJs     was    fine,    and    that    was    fortunate,    because
Vatican/ShanJhai needed to add a  couple of  floors  to  the  Free Phthisis
Sanatorium every  year.  Now  it   loomed  hiJh   above any  of   the  other
waterfront buildinJs.

       As  with   any  other  extruded buildinJ,   the  desiJn was  drab  in  the
extreme, each floor exactly alike. The walls were of an unexceptional beiJe
material that had been used to construct many of the buildinJs in the L.T.,
which was unfortunate, because it had an almost maJnetic attraction for the
cineritious  corpses of   airborne  mites.  Like  all   the  other  buildinJs   so
constituted, the Free Phthisis Sanatorium had, over the years, turned black,
and not evenly but in  vertical rain-streaks. ,t  was a cliché to Moke that the
outside of the Sanatorium looked much like the inside of its tenants' lunJs.
The Fists of RiJhteous Harmony had, however, done their best to pretty it
up by slappinJ red posters over it in the dead of niJht.

372
       Harv  was lyinJ  on the top  of a three-layer bunkbed on the  twentieth
floor, sharinJ a small room and a supply of purified  air with  a do]en other
chronic asthma sufferers. His face was JoJJled into a phantascope, and his
lips were wrapped around a thick tube pluJJed  into a nebuli]er  socket on
the wall. Vapori]ed  druJs, straiJht from the matter compiler, were flowinJ
down that  tube  and  into  his  lunJs,  workinJ  to  keep  his  bronchi  from
spasminJ shut.

       Nell  stopped for  a  moment before  breakinJ him  out  of  his ractive.
Some weeks he looked better than others; this week he did not look Jood.
His body  was bloated, his  face round  and heavy, his  finJers  swollen to
puffy cylinders; they had been JivinJ him heavy steroid treatments. But she
would have  known  he'd had a  bad week anyway,  because usually Harv
didn't Jo in  for immersive ractives. He liked  the kind you  held in your lap
on a sheet of smart paper. Nell tried to send Harv a letter every day, simply
written in  mediaJlyphics, and for a  while he had tried  to respond in kind.
Last year he had even Jiven  up on  this, thouJh  she wrote him  faithfully
anyway.

       “Nell!”   he said when he had peeled the JoJJles away  from his eyes.
“Sorry, , was chasinJ some rich Vickys.”

       “You  were?”

       “Yeah. Or  Burly Scudd was, , mean. ,n the ractive. See, Burly's bitch
Jets preJnant, and she's Jot to buy herself a Freedom Machine to Jet rid of
it, so she Jets a Mob as a maid-of-all-work for some snotty Vickys and rips
off some of their nice old stuff, fiJurinJ  that's a faster way to Jet the money.
So the bitch is  runninJ  away and they're chasinJ her on  their chevs, and
then Burly Scudd shows up in his  biJ truck  and turns the tables and starts
chasinJ them. ,f you do it riJht,  you can Jet the Vickys to fall into a biJ  pit
of manure! ,t's Jreat! You should try it,”  Harv  said, then, exhausted by this
effort, Jrabbed his oxyJen tube and pulled on it for a while.

       “,t  sounds entertaininJ,” Nell said.

373
       Harv,  temporarily   JaJJed  by  the  oxyJen  tube,  watched  her  face
carefully  and was  not  convinced.  “Sorry,”  he  blurted  between  breaths,
“forJot  you don't care for my kind of  ractive. Don't they have Burly  Scudd
in that Primer of yours?”

       Nell  made  herself smile  at the  Moke, which Harv had  been makinJ
every week. She handed him the basket of cookies and fresh fruit that she
had brouJht down from Dovetail and sat with him for an hour, talkinJ about
the thinJs  he  enMoyed talkinJ about,  until   she could  see  his  attention
wanderinJ back  toward the  JoJJles.  Then she said  Jood-bye until   next
week and kissed him Jood-bye.

       She turned her veil  to its  hiJhest level  of opacity  and made her way
toward the door. Harv impulsively  Jrabbed his oxyJen tube and sucked on
it miJhtily  a few times, then called her name Must as she was about to leave.

       “Yes?” she said, turninJ toward him.

       “Nell,   , want  to tell  you  how fine  you  look,”  he said, “Must like the
finest Vicky lady in all of  Atlantis. , can't believe you're my same Nell that ,
used to brinJ thinJs to  in the old  flat—remember those days? , know that
you and ,  have Jone different ways,  ever since that morninJ  in Dovetail,
and , know it's Jot a lot to do with that Primer. , Must want to tell you, sister,
that even thouJh , say bad stuff  about Vickys sometimes, ,'m as proud of
you as , could be, and , hope when you read that Primer—so full of stuff  ,
could never understand or even  read—you'll  think  back on  your brother
Harv, who saw it lyinJ  in  the Jutter years aJo and took it into  his mind to
brinJ  it  to  his  kid  sister. Will   you remember  that, Nell?”   With  that he
pluJJed the oxyJen tube back into his mouth, and his ribs beJan to heave.

       “Of   course ,  will,  Harv,”  Nell  said,  her eyes fillinJ   with  tears, and
blundered her way  back  across the room  until   she could  sweep Harv's
bloated body up in her stronJ arms. The veil  swirled like  a sheet of water
thrown into Harv's face, all  the little  umbrellas drawinJ  themselves out of
the way as she brouJht his face up to hers and planted a kiss on his cheek.

374
       The veil conJealed aJain as he sank back down onto the foam mattress
—Must like the mattresses he had tauJht her to Jet from the M.C., lonJ aJo
—and she turned and ran out of the room sobbinJ.


                                Hackworth  is brought up-to-date
                                           by the great Napier. 



“Have you had the opportunity to speak with your family?”  Colonel Napier
said,  speakinJ   out   of    a   mediatronic   tabletop  from    his   office    in
Atlantis/ShanJhai. Hackworth was sittinJ in a pub in Atlantis/Vancouver.

       Napier  looked   Jood  now  that  he  was  deeper into   middle  aJe—
somewhat more imposinJ. He'd been workinJ  on  his bearinJ. Hackworth
had been temporarily impressed when Napier's imaJe had first materiali]ed
on the mediatron, then he remembered his own imaJe in the mirror.  Once
he'd Jotten himself cleaned up and trimmed his beard, which he'd decided
to keep, he reali]ed that he had a new bearinJ of  his own. Even if  he was
desperately confused about how he Jot it.

       “ThouJht   ,'d  find  out  what the  hell  happened first.  Besides—” He
stopped  talkinJ    for   a   while.    He   was  havinJ    trouble   JettinJ   his
conversational rhythm back.

       “Yes?” Napier said in a labored display of patience.

       “,  Must spoke to Fiona this morninJ.”

       “After  you left the tunnels?”

       “No.  Before. Before ,—woke up, or whatever.”

       Napier  was sliJhtly  taken aback and only  popped his Maw muscles a
couple of times, reached for his tea, looked irrelevantly out  the window at
whatever view he had out his  office window  in  New Chusan. Hackworth,

375
on the other side of the Pacific, contented himself with starinJ into the inky
depths of a pint of stout.

       A  dream-imaJe surfaced in Hackworth's mind,  like  a piece of debris
risinJ to  the surface after a shipwreck, inexorably  musclinJ tons of  Jreen
murk out  of  its  path. He  saw a JlisteninJ  blue  proMectile shoot into the
Doctor's beiJe-Jloved hands, trailinJ  a thick  cord, watched it  unfold,  nay
bloom into a baby.

       “Why  did , think  of that?” he said.

       Napier seemed pu]]led  by this  remark. “Fiona and Gwendolyn are in
Atlantis/Seattle now—half an hour from your  present location by tube,” he
said.

       “Of  course! They live—we live—in  Seattle now. , knew that.” He was
rememberinJ Fiona hikinJ   around in  the  caldera of  some snow-covered
volcano.

       “,f   you are under the impression that you've been in contact with her
recently—which is Tuite out of  the Tuestion, ,'m afraid—then it must have
been mediated throuJh the Primer. We were not able to break the encryption
on the  siJnals  passinJ out  of  the  Drummers'  cave, but  traffic   analysis
suJJests that you've spent a lot of time ractinJ in the last ten years.”

       “Ten years!?”

       “Yes. But surely you must have suspected that, from evidence.”

       “,t  feels like  ten years. , sense that ten years of thinJs have happened
to me. But the enJineer hemisphere has a bit of trouble cominJ to Jrips.”

       “We  are at a loss to understand why Dr. ;  would  choose to have you
serve out your sentence amonJ the Drummers,” Napier said. “,t would seem
to us that your enJineer hemisphere, as you put it,  is your  most desirable
feature as far  as he is  concerned—you know that  the Celestials are still
terribly short of enJineers.”

376
       “,'ve   been workinJ   on  somethinJ,”   Hackworth  said.  ,maJes of   a
nanotechnoloJical system, somethinJ admirably compact and eleJant, were
flashinJ over his  mind's eye. ,t  seemed to be very nice work,  the kind  of
thinJ he could produce only when he was concentratinJ very hard for a lonJ
time. As, for example, a prisoner miJht do.

       “What  sort of thinJ  exactly?” Napier asked, suddenly soundinJ rather
tense.

       “Can't  Jet  a  Jrip  on  it,”  Hackworth   finally  said,  shakinJ his  head
helplessly. The detailed imaJes of atoms and bonds had been replaced, in
his mind's eye, by a fat  brown seed hanJinJ in space, like somethinJ in  a
MaJritte  paintinJ.  A   lush  bifurcated  curve  on  one  end, like   buttocks,
converJinJ to a nipplelike point on the other.

       “What  the hell happened?”

       “Before  you left ShanJhai, Dr. ;   hooked you up to a matter compiler,
no?”

       “Yes.”

       “Did  he tell you what he was puttinJ into your system?”

       “,  Juessed it was hæmocules of some description.”

       “We took blood samples before you left ShanJhai.”

       “You  did?”

       “We  have ways,” Colonel Napier said. “We also did  a full workup  on
one of your friends from the cave and found several million nanosites in her
brain.”

       “Several million?”

       “Very   small  ones,” Napier  said  reassurinJly. “They  are  introduced
throuJh  the   blood,  of   course—the  hæmocules  circulate  throuJh   the

377
bloodstream until they  find  themselves passinJ throuJh capillaries in  the
brain, at which  point  they cut  throuJh  the blood/brain barrier  and fasten
themselves to a nearby  axon. They  can monitor  activity   in  the axon  or
triJJer it. These 'sites all talk to each other with visible liJht.”

       “So  when  ,  was on  my  own,  my  'sites Must talked to themselves,”
Hackworth said, “but  when , came into  close proximity  with other people
who had these thinJs in their brains—”

       “,t   didn't  matter which  brain  a 'site was  in.  They all   talked to  one
another indiscriminately, forminJ a network. Get some Drummers toJether
in a dark room, and they become a Jestalt society.”

       “But  the interface between these nanosites and the brain itself—”

       “Yes,  ,  admit  that  a  few  million   of  these thinJs  piJJybackinJ   on
randomly  chosen neurons  is  only   a  feeble  interface  to  somethinJ  as
complicated as the human brain,” Napier said. “We're not claiminJ that you
shared one brain with these people.”

       “So what did ,  share with them exactly?” Hackworth said.

       “Food.  Air. Companionship. Body fluids. Perhaps emotions or Jeneral
emotional states. Probably more.”

       “That's all ,  did for ten years?”

       “You  did a lot  of thinJs,”  Napier said, “but  you did  them in a sort of
unconscious, dreamlike state. You  were sleepwalkinJ.  When we  fiJured
that out—after  doinJ  the biopsy  on your  fellow-troJlodyte—we   realised
that in some sense you were no lonJer actinJ of your own free will, and we
enJineered a hunter-killer that would seek out and destroy the nanosites in
your  brain.   We  introduced  it,   in   a  dormant  mode,  into   this  female
Drummer's system, then reintroduced her to your colony. When you had sex
with her—well, you can work out the rest for yourself.”

378
       “You  have Jiven me  information, Colonel  Napier, and ,  am Jrateful,
but it has only made me more confused. What do you suppose the Celestial
KinJdom wanted with me?”

       “Did  Dr. ;   ask anythinJ of you?”

       “To  seek the Alchemist.”

       Colonel Napier looked startled. “He asked that of you ten years aJo?”

       “Yes. ,n as many words.”

       “That  is  very  sinJular,”  Napier  said, after  a prolonJed  interlude of
mustache-twiddlinJ. “We have only been aware of this shadowy fiJure  for
some five years and know virtually  nothinJ about him—other  than that he
is a wi]ardly artifex  who is conspirinJ with Dr. ;.”

       “,s  there any other information—”

       “NothinJ   that ,   can reveal,”  Napier said  brusTuely, perhaps havinJ
revealed too much already. “Do  let us know  if  you  find him,  thouJh. Er,
Hackworth, there is no  tactful way  to broach this  subMect. Are you aware
that your wife has divorced you?”

       “Oh,  yes,” Hackworth said Tuietly. “, suppose , did know that.” But he
hadn't been conscious of it until now.

       “She was remarkably understandinJ about your lonJ absence,” Napier
said, “but at some point it became evident that, like all the Drummers, you
had become sexually promiscuous in the extreme.”

       “How  did she know?”

       “We warned her.”

       “Pardon me?”

379
       “,   mentioned  earlier  that  we   found  thinJs  in   your  blood.  These
hæmocules were desiJned specifically to  be spread throuJh exchanJe of
bodily fluids.”

       “How  do you know that?”

       Napier seemed impatient for  the first time.  “For  Jod's sake, man, we
know what we are doinJ. These particles had two functions: spread throuJh
exchanJe of bodily fluids,  and interact with each other. Once we saw that,
we had no ethical choice but to inform your wife.”

       “Of  course. That's only riJht.  As a matter of  fact, , thank  you for it,”
Hackworth said.  “And  it's  not hard  to understand Gwen's feelinJs  about
sharinJ bodily fluids with thousands of Drummers.”

       “You  shouldn't beat yourself  up,” Napier  said. “We've sent explorers
down there.”

       “Really?”

       “Yes.   The  Drummers  don't   mind.  The   explorers  relate  that   the
Drummers behave much the way people do in dreams. “Poorly defined eJo
boundaries' was the phrase, as , recall. ,n any event, your behaviour down
there wasn't necessarily a moral transJression as such—your mind wasn't
your own.”

       “You  said that these particles interact with each other?”

       “Each  one  is  a container  for  some  rod loJic   and some  memory,”
Napier said. “When  one  particle encounters another either  in  vivo or  in
vitro, they dock and seem to exchanJe data for a few moments. Most of the
time they  disenJaJe and  drift  apart. Sometimes they  stay  docked for  a
while,  and computation  takes place—we can  tell  because the rod  loJic
throws off  heat. Then they disconnect. Sometimes both particles  Jo their
separate ways, sometimes one of them Joes dead. But one of them always
keeps JoinJ.”

380
       The implications of that last sentence were not lost on Hackworth. “Do
the Drummers only have sex with one another, or—”

       “That  was our first Tuestion too,” Napier said. “The answer is no. They
have a very Jood deal of sex with many, many other people. They actually
run bordellos in  Vancouver. They cater especially to  the Aerodrome-and-
tube-station crowd.  A  few   years aJo  they  came into  conflict   with   the
established bordellos because they were hardly charJinJ any money at all
for their  services. They raised their prices Must to be diplomatic. But they
don't want the money—what on earth would they do with it?”


                        From the Primer,  a visit to Castle Turing; a
                  chat with  Miss Matheson; speculation as to Nell's  
                      destiny; farewell;  conversation with a grizzled 
                        hoplite;  Nell goes forth to seek her fortune. 

381
The new  territory  into  which  Princess Nell  had  crossed was by  far  the
larJest and most complex of all the Faery KinJdoms in  the Primer. PaJinJ
back to the  first  panoramic illustration,  she  counted seven maMor castles
perched on the mountaintops, and she knew perfectly well that she would
have to visit all of them, and do somethinJ difficult  in each one, in order to
retrieve the eleven keys that had been stolen from her and the one key that
remained.

       She made  herself some tea  and sandwiches and  carried them  in  a
basket to a meadow, where she liked to sit amonJ the wildflowers and read.
Constable Moore's house was a melancholy place without the Constable in
it, and it  had been several weeks since she had seen him. DurinJ the last
two years he had been called away on business with increasinJ freTuency,
vanishinJ (as she supposed) into the interior of China for days, then weeks
at a time, cominJ back depressed and exhausted to find solace in whiskey,
which  he consumed in  surprisinJly   moderate Tuantities but  with  fierce
concentration, and in midniJht  baJpipe recitals that  woke up everyone in
Dovetail and a few sensitive sleepers in the New Atlantis Clave.

       DurinJ  her trip from the campsite of the Mouse Army to the first of the
castles, Nell had to use all the wilderness skills she had learned in years of
travelinJ  around  the Land   Beyond:  She fouJht   with  a  mountain  lion,
avoided a bear, forded streams, lit fires, built shelters. By the time Nell had
maneuvered Princess Nell to  the ancient moss-covered Jates of  the first
castle, the sun was shininJ hori]ontally across the meadow and the air was
becominJ a bit chilly. Nell  wrapped herself up in a thermoJenic shawl and
set the thermostat for somethinJ a little on the cool side of comfortable; she
had found that her wits became dull if  she Jot too co]y.  The basket had a
thermos of hot  tea with  milk,   and the sandwiches would  hold  out for  a
while.

       Nell  knew,  vaJuely, that  the  name Castle TurinJ  was  a hint;  she'd
learned a bit about TurinJ at Miss Matheson's Academy. He had somethinJ
to do with computers. She could have turned to the Encyclopædia paJes and
looked it riJht up, but she had learned to let the Primer tell the story its own
way. Clearly the soldiers were not men in armor, but simply wind-up  men,
and the same was probably true of the Duke of TurinJ himself.

       After   a  short and  not  very  interestinJ  conversation, durinJ   which
Princess Nell tried unsuccessfully to establish whether the Duke was or was
not human, he announced, unemotionally, that he was throwinJ her into the
dunJeon forever.

       This  sort of  thinJ  no  lonJer  surprised or upset  Nell  because it had
happened hundreds of   times  durinJ  her  relationship   with  the   Primer.
Besides, she had known, from  the very  first  day Harv  had Jiven her  the

385
book, how the story would  come out in  the end. ,t  was Must that the story
was anfractuous; it developed more ramifications the more closely she read
it.

        Nell  had a pretty  Jood idea what  to do with  the  chain. StartinJ  with  the
end, she examined  the toJJles  and beJan to  mark  their  positions  down  (the
Primer always  Jave  her scratch  paJes when she needed them).  She made  a
hori]ontal   mark   for  toJJles   parallel  to  the  chain  and  a  vertical  mark   for
those that were perpendicular,  and came up with  this:
||||||||-| ||||-||||| |||||||-|| ||||||||| |-|||||||| |||||||--| ||||||||- -|-|||||||| ||||| 
---||| |-|||||||| ||||||||| ||||-||||| ||||||-||| ||-----|| || |||||||||| ||||||-||| ||||||||| |||||||||  
-||||||||| ||||||||| - |||||||||- ||||||||| |||||-|||| |||- 


        ,f  she counted the vertical  marks  and replaced them  with  numbers, this
amounted to

388
       8-5-12-12-15- -9- -1-13- - -4-21-11-5- - - - -20-21-18-9-14-7-

       and if  the numbers stood for letters of  the alphabet, hori]ontal marks
divided the letters, and double hori]ontals were spaces, this was

       HELLO  , AM-  - -D8KE-  - - -  -T8R,NG

       Perhaps the  multiple   hori]ontals   were  codes  for  commonly   used
words:

       - - -                                                                                 the

       - - - -                                             (not used; possibly a/an?)

       - - - - -                                    of

       ,f  that was riJht, then the messaJe was HELLO , AM THE D8KE  OF
T8R,NG,  which  was interestinJ, since  the Jiant fellow   in the  armor had
previously identified  himself  as such, and she deemed it unlikely  that  he
would be sendinJ her a messaJe by this route. This must have come from
someone else callinJ himself  the Duke  of TurinJ—perhaps  a real, livinJ
human beinJ.

       A  few years aJo Nell  could have relied on  it. But  in recent years the
Primer had become much subtler than it used to be, full of hidden traps, and
she could no lonJer make comfortable and easy assumptions. ,t was Must as
likely that this chain had descended straiJht from the throne room itself, and
that the mechanical Duke  was, for  some unfathomable  reason, tryinJ  to
dupe her. So while she was happy to respond to this messaJe in kind, she
intended to take a Juarded approach until she had established whether the
sender was human or mechanical.

       The next part of the messaJe was G,VE- - -CHA,N-  - - -T8G-  - - -  - -
ANSWER.  AssuminJ that  four  hori]ontal   marks stood for  a/an  and six
stood for to, this was G,VE THE CHA,N A  T8G  TO ANSWER.

389
       Nell  beJan to flip  the toJJles on the chain, erasinJ the messaJe from
this  personaJe callinJ  himself   the  Duke  and  replacinJ  it   with   ,  AM
PR,NCESS NELL  WHY  D,D  YO8   ,MPR,SON  ME.  Then she Jave  the
chain a tuJ, and after a moment it beJan to withdraw from  her cell. A  few
minutes later, back came the messaJe:

       WELCOME    PR,NCESS   NELL    LET    8S    DEV,SE    A   MORE
EFF,C,ENT MEANS  OF COMM8N,CAT,ON

       followed  by  instructions  on how  to  use a more  compact system of
toJJles to represent numbers, and how to convert the numbers into letters
and punctuation marks. Once this was settled, the Duke said

       ,  AM  THE  REAL  D8KE.   ,  CREATED THESE  MACH,NES,  AND
THEY ,MPR,SONED  ME ,N  A H,GH  TOWER FAR  ABOVE YO8.   THE
MACH,NE    CALL,NG     H,MSELF    THE   D8KE    ,S   MERELY    THE
LARGEST AND  MOST SOPH,ST,CATED OF MY  CREAT,ONS.

       Nell  responded, TH,S CHA,N  WE,GHS H8NDREDS   OF PO8NDS.
YO8  M8ST  BE STRONG FOR A H8MAN.

       The Duke responded YO8  ARE  A SHARP  ONE PR,NCESS NELL!
THE  F8LL    WE,GHT   OF   THE  CHA,N    ,S  ACT8ALLY     SEVERAL
THO8SAND  PO8NDS,  AND  , MANAGE  ,T  BY MEANS  OF A W,NCH
LOCATED  ,N   MY   ROOM  AND   DER,V,NG   ,TS   MOT,VE   POWER
FROM THE CENTRAL  SHAFT.

       NiJht  had lonJ  since fallen  on  the meadow. Nell  closed the Primer,
packed up her basket, and returned home.

       She stayed up late into the niJht with the Primer, Must as she had when
she was a small child, and as a result was late for church the next morninJ.
They said a special prayer for Miss Matheson, who was at home and said to
be feelinJ poorly. Nell called on her for a few minutes after the service, then
went straiJht back home and dove into the Primer aJain.

390
       She was attackinJ two problems at once. First, she needed to fiJure out
how the lock on the door  worked. Second, she needed to find out whether
the person sendinJ her the messaJe was human or mechanical. ,f she could
be confident  that he  was a human,  she could  ask him  for  assistance in
openinJ the lock, but  until  she had settled this issue, she had to keep her
activities a secret.

       The lock  only  had a few parts that she could  observe: the crank, the
bolt, and a  pair  of brass drums  set into  the top  with  diJits  from  0  to 9
enJraved in them, so that by spinninJ different ways, they could display all
the inteJers from  00 to 99.  These drums were in  almost constant motion
whenever the crank was turninJ.

       Nell  had manaJed to detach several yards of chain from the one that
she was usinJ  to converse with  the  Duke, and  so she was  able to  feed
different messaJes into the lock and see what result they had.

       The  number on  the top  chanJed with  every link  that  went  into the
machine, and it seemed to determine, in a limited  way, what  the machine
would do next; for  example, she had learned that the number happened to
be 09, and if the next link  in  the chain was in the vertical  position (which
the Duke referred to as a one), the drums would spin around and chanJe the
number to 23. But if the next link was, instead, a ]ero (as the Duke referred
to links  with  hori]ontal  toJJles),  the number drums would  chanJe to 03.
But  that wasn't  all:  ,n  this  case, the  machine would,  for   some reason,
reverse the direction in which the chain was movinJ  throuJh the machine,
and also flick the toJJle from  ]ero to one. That is, the machine could write
on the chain as well as read from it.

       From idle  chitchat with  the Duke she learned that the numbers on the
drums were referred to as states. At first she did not know which states led
to other states, and so she wandered aimlessly from one state to the next,
recordinJ the connections on scratch paper. This soon Jrew to a table listinJ
some thirty-two different states and how the lock would respond to a one or
a ]ero when it was in each of those states. ,t took a while for Nell to fill out
all the blank spaces in the table, because some of the states were hard to Jet

391
to—they could be  reached only by JettinJ  the machine to  write  a certain
series of ones and ]eros on the chain.

       She would  have Jone cra]y  with  ones and ]eros  were it  not for  the
freTuent interruptions from the Duke,  who evidently had nothinJ  better to
do  than to   send her  messaJes. These two  parallel  courses  of  inTuiry
occupied all of Nell's  free time for  a couple of weeks, and she made slow
but steady proJress.

       “You  must learn how to operate the lock on your door,” the Duke said.
“This will  enable you to effect an escape and to come and rescue me. , will
instruct you.”

       All  he wanted to talk about was technoloJy, which wouldn't help  Nell
in fiJurinJ  out whether he was a human or a machine. “Why don't you pick
your own lock,”  she responded, “and come and rescue me? , am Must a poor
helpless younJ thinJ all  alone in the world,  and so scared and lonely, and
you seem so brave and heroic;  your story  really is  Tuite romantic,  and ,
cannot wait to  see how it  all  comes out now that  our fates have become
intertwined.”

       “The   machines placed  a  special  lock  on  my   door,  not  a  TurinJ
machine,” responded the Duke.

       “Describe yourself,”  Nell wrote.

       “NothinJ  special, ,'m afraid,” wrote the Duke. “How about yourself?”

       “SliJhtly   taller than averaJe, flashinJ Jreen eyes, raven hair fallinJ in
luxuriant  waves to  my  waist  unless ,  pin  it   up to  emphasi]e  my  hiJh
cheekbones and full lips.  Narrow  waist, pert  breasts, lonJ leJs, alabaster
skin that flushes vividly   when , am  passionate about somethinJ, which is
freTuently.”

       “Your  description is reminiscent of my late wife, God rest her soul.”

       “Tell  me about your wife.”

392
        “The  subMect fills me with   such unutterable  sadness that ,  cannot  bear
to write  about it.  Now, let's  buckle down  to work  on the TurinJ   machine.”

        Since the prurient  approach had  dead-ended, Nell  tried a different  tack:
playinJ  stupid.  Sooner or later,  the Duke would  become  a little  testy. But  he
was always  terribly   patient  with  her,  even after  the  twentieth  repetition   of
“Could   you  explain  it  aJain  with   different   words?  ,  still  don't  Jet  it.”   Of
course,  for  all   she  knew,   he  was  upstairs  punchinJ   the   walls  until    his
knuckles  were bloody  and  simply  pretendinJ  to  be patient  with  her. A  man
who'd  been  locked  up  in  a  tower  for   years would   learn  to  be  extremely
patient.

        She  tried   sendinJ   him  poetry.   He   sent  back  JlowinJ    reviews   but
declined  to  send her  any of   his own,   sayinJ  it  wasn't  Jood  enouJh  to  be
committed  to metal.

        On her twentieth   day in the  dunJeon, Princess Nell   finally  Jot  the lock
open. Rather than  makinJ  an  immediate  escape, she locked  herself back  in
and sat down to ponder  her next move.

        ,f  the Duke  was human,  she should  notify  him  so that  they could  plan
their escape. ,f  he was  a machine, doinJ   so would  lead to  disaster. She had
to fiJure  out the Duke's  identity  before  she made another move.

        She sent him another  poem.

 

      For the Greek's love she gave away her heart
      Her father, crown and homeland. 
      They stopped to rest on Naxos 
      She woke up alone upon the strand 
      The sails of her lover's ship descending 
      Round the slow curve of the earth. Ariadne 
      Fell into a swoon on the churned sand 
      And dreamed of home. Minos did not for give her
      And holding diamonds in the pouches of his eyes 
      Had her flung into the Labyrinth. 
      She was alone this time. Through a wilderness
      2f blackness wandered Ariadne many days 

393
      8ntil she tripped on the memory.
      It was still wound all through the place.
      She spun it round her fingers 
      Lifted it from the floor 
      Knotted it into lace 
      Erased it. 
      The lace made a gift for him who had imprisoned her .
      Blind with tears, he read it with his fingers 
      And opened his arms. 

 

The  answer   came  back   much   too  Tuickly,    and  it   was  the  same  answer   as
always:   “,  do  so  envy  your   skill   with   words.   Now,   if  you  do  not  obMect, let
us turn  our  attention   to  the inner   workinJs   of  the  TurinJ   machine.”

        She   had  made   it  as  obvious    as  she  dared,   and  the  Duke    still   hadn't
Jotten  the  messaJe.  He  must  be a machine.

        Why   the  deception?

        Clearly,    the mechanical    Duke   desired  for   her to  learn   about  the  TurinJ
machines.  That  is,  if  a machine   could   ever be  said  to desire  somethinJ.

        There    must  be   somethinJ    wronJ    with   the   Duke's   proJramminJ.      He
knew  there  was  somethinJ   wronJ   with   it,  and he  needed  a human  to  fix  it.

        Once   Nell   had  fiJured    these  thinJs    out,  the  rest  of   the  Castle   TurinJ
story   resolved   itself    Tuickly    and   neatly.   She  slipped    out   of   her  cell   and
stealthily   explored   the  castle.  The  soldiers   rarely  noticed   her,  and when   they
did,   they   could   not   improvise;     they   had   to   Jo   back   to  the   Duke    to  be
reproJrammed.     Eventually,      Princess    Nell    found    her   way    into    a   room
beneath   the   windmill       that   contained     a  sort    of   clutch    mechanism.     By
disenJaJinJ    the  clutch,   she was  able  to  stop  the  Shaft.   Within    a few   hours,
the  sprinJs    inside   the  soldiers'    back   had  all   run   down,    and  they   had   all
stopped  in  their   tracks.   The  whole    castle  was  fro]en,    as if   she  had  cast  an
enchantment   over  it.

394
       Now  roaminJ  freely, she opened up  the Duke's throne  and found  a
TurinJ machine beneath it. On either side of the machine was a narrow hole
descendinJ straiJht throuJh the  floor  and into  the earth for  as far as her
torch liJht  could  illuminate  it.  The chain  containinJ  the Duke's proJram
danJled on either side into these holes. Nell tried throwinJ  stones into the
holes and never heard them hit  bottom; the  chain must be  unfathomably
lonJ.

       HiJh  up in one of the castle's towers, Princess Nell found a skeleton in
a chair, slumped over a table piled hiJh with  books. Mice, buJs, and birds
had nibbled away all of the flesh, but traces of Jray hair and whiskers were
still  scattered around the table,  and around the  cervical vertebrae was a
Jolden chain bearinJ a seal with the T insiJnia.

       She spent some time JoinJ  throuJh the  Duke's books. Most of  them
were notebooks where he would sketch the inventions he hadn't had time to
build yet. He had plans for whole armies of TurinJ machines made to run in
parallel, and  for  chains with   links  that  could  be set  in  more  than two
positions, and for machines that would read and write on two-dimensional
sheets of chain mail  instead of  one-dimensional chains, and for  a  three-
dimensional TurinJ Jrid  a mile  on a side, throuJh  which a mobile  TurinJ
machine would climb about, computinJ as it went.

       No  matter  how  complicated his  desiJns became, the  Duke  always
found a way to simulate their behavior by puttinJ  a sufficiently  lonJ chain
into one of  the traditional  TurinJ  machines. That is to  say that while  the
parallel and  multidimensional  machines  worked  more Tuickly   than  the
oriJinal model, they didn't really do anythinJ different.

       One afternoon, Nell was sittinJ  in her favorite meadow, readinJ about
these thinJs in  the Primer, when  a riderless chevaline emerJed from  the
woods and Jalloped directly  toward  her. This was not  hiJhly  unusual, in
and of  itself;  chevalines were smart  enouJh to  be sent out  in  search of
specific persons. People rarely sent them in search of Nell, thouJh.

395
       The chevaline Jalloped at her full-tilt  until  it was Must a few feet away,
and then planted its hooves and stopped instantly—a trick it could easily do
when it  wasn't carryinJ  a human. ,t  was carryinJ  a note written  in  Miss
Stricken's hand:  “Nell,    please come  immediately.  Miss   Matheson has
reTuested your presence, and time is short.”

       Nell   didn't hesitate. She  Jathered her thinJs,  stuffed  them into   the
mount's small luJJaJe compartment, and climbed on. “Go!” she said. Then,
JettinJ  herself  well   situated and  clenchinJ  the  hand-Jrips,  she added,
“8nlimited   speed.”  Within   moments the  chevaline  was threadinJ  Japs
between trees at somethinJ close to a cheetah's sprint velocity, clawinJ its
way up the hill toward the doJ pod Jrid.

       From  the way  the tubes ran,  Nell  Juessed that Miss Matheson was
pluJJed into the Feed in two or three different ways, thouJh everythinJ had
been discreetly hidden under many afJhans, piled up on top of her body like
the airy layers of a French pastry. Only her face and hands were visible, and
lookinJ at them Nell  remembered for the first time since their introduction
Must how old Miss Matheson was. The force of her personality had blinded
Nell and all the Jirls to the blunt evidence of her true aJe.

       “Please  let  us be,  Miss  Stricken,”   Miss  Matheson said,  and Miss
Stricken backed out warily, strewinJ reluctant and reprovinJ Jlances alonJ
her trail.

       Nell   sat on  the  edJe of  the  bed  and carefully   lifted  one  of  Miss
Matheson's hands from the coverlet, as if it were the desiccated leaf of some
rare tree. “Nell,”   Miss  Matheson said, “do  not  waste my  few remaininJ
moments with pleasantries.”

       “Oh,  Miss  Matheson—” Nell  beJan, but the old  lady's eyes widened
and she Jave Nell  a certain look,  practiced throuJh many  decades in the
classroom, that still had not lost its power to silence.

       “,   have reTuested that you come  here because you are my  favorite
student. No! Do not say a word,”  Miss  Matheson admonished her, as Nell
leaned her face closer, eyes fillinJ with tears. “Teachers are not supposed to

396
have favorites, but , am approachinJ that time when , must confess all my
sins, so there it is.

       “,  know  that you have a secret, Nell, thouJh , cannot imaJine what it
is, and , know that your secret has made you different from any other Jirl ,
have ever tauJht. ,  wonder what you  suppose you will  do  with  your life
when you  leave this  Academy,  as you  must soon,  and Jo  out  into  the
world?”

       “Take the Oath, of course, as soon as , reach the aJe of eliJibility. And
,  suppose that ,  should like  to  study  the art  of  proJramminJ,  and how
ractives are made. Someday, of course, after  ,  have become one of  Her
MaMesty's subMects, , should like to find a nice husband and perhaps raise
children—”

       “Oh,  stop  it,”   Miss  Matheson said. “You   are a  younJ  woman—of
course you  think  about  whether you  shall  have  children—every  younJ
woman does. ,  haven't much time  left,  Nell,  and we must  dispense with
what makes you like all the other Jirls and concentrate on what makes you
different.”

       At  this  point, the  old lady  Jripped Nell's  hand with  surprisinJ  force
and raised her head Must a bit off the pillow. The tremendous wrinkles and
furrows on  her brow  deepened, and her hooded eyes took on  an intense
burninJ appearance. “Your destiny  is marked  in  some way, Nell.  ,  have
known it since the day Lord  Finkle-McGraw  came to me and asked me to
admit you—a raJJed little thete Jirl—into my Academy.

       “You  can try to act the same—we have tried to make you the same—
you can pretend it in the future if you insist, and you can even take the Oath
—but it's all a lie. You are different.”

       These words struck Nell like  a sudden cold wind of pure mountain air
and stripped away  the soporific  cloud  of  sentimentality. Now  she  stood
exposed and utterly vulnerable. But not unpleasantly so.

397
       “Are  you  suJJestinJ that ,  leave the bosom of the adopted tribe  that
has nurtured me?”

       “,  am suJJestinJ that you are one of those rare people who transcends
tribes, and you  certainly  don't need  a bosom anymore,”  Miss  Matheson
said. “You will  find,  in time, that this  tribe is as Jood as any other—better
than most, really.” Miss  Matheson exhaled deeply and seemed to dissolve
into her blankets. “Now,  , haven't lonJ.  So Jive  us a kiss, and then be on
your way, Jirl.”

       Nell   leaned forward  and pressed her  lips  aJainst Miss  Matheson's
cheek, which looked leathery but was surprisinJly soft. Then, unwillinJ   to
leave so abruptly, she turned  her head and rested it  on Miss  Matheson's
chest for a few moments. Miss Matheson stroked feebly at her hair and tut-
tutted.

       “Farewell,  Miss Matheson,” Nell said. “, will  never forJet you.”

       “Nor  , you,”  Miss Matheson whispered, “thouJh admittedly that is not
sayinJ much.”

         

A very larJe  chevaline stood stolidly in  front of  Constable Moore's house,
somewhere between a Percheron and a small elephant in si]e and bulk. ,t
was the dirtiest obMect Nell had ever seen in her life—its encrustations alone
must have weiJhed hundreds of pounds and were redolent with the scent of
niJht soil and staJnant water. A fraJment of a mulberry branch, still bearinJ
leaves and even a couple of actual berries, had Jotten wedJed into a flexinJ
Moint between two adMoininJ armor plates, and lonJ ropes of milfoil trailed
from its ankles.

       The  Constable  was  sittinJ   in   the  middle  of   his  bamboo  Jrove,
enveloped in a suit of hoplite  armor, similarly  filthy  and scarred, that was
twice as biJ as he was, and that made his bare head look absurdly small. He
had ripped the helmet off and dropped it into his fish pond, where it floated

398
around like the eviscerated hull of a scuttled dreadnouJht. He looked very
Jaunt and was starinJ vacantly, without  blinkinJ,  at some kud]u  that was
slowly but inexorably conTuerinJ the wisteria. As soon as Nell saw the look
on his face, she made him some tea and brouJht it to him.  The Constable
reached for the tiny  alabaster teacup with armored hands that could have
crumbled stones like loaves of  stale bread. The thick  barrels of  the Juns
built into  the arms of his suit were scorched on the inside. He plucked the
cup from Nell's hands with the precision of a surJical robot, but did not lift
it to his lips, perhaps afraid that he miJht, in his exhaustion, Jet the distance
a bit  wronJ  and inadvertently  crush the  porcelain into  his  Maw, or even
decapitate himself. Merely holdinJ the cup, watchinJ the steam rise from its
surface, seemed  to  calm  him.   His   nostrils  dilated   once,  then  aJain.
“DarMeelinJ,” he said. “Well  chosen. Always  thouJht of  ,ndia  as a more
civilised place than China. Have to throw out all of  the oolonJ now, all the
keemun, the  lunJ  ManJ, the lapsanJ souchonJ. Time  to  switch  over  to
Ceylon, pekoe, assam.” He chuckled.

       White  trails of  dried salt ran back from the corners of the Constable's
eyes and disappeared into his hairline.  He  had been ridinJ  fast  with  his
helmet off.   Nell  wished  that  she  had  been able  to  see the  Constable
thunderinJ across China on his war chevaline.

       “,'ve  retired for the last time,” he explained. He nodded in the direction
of  China. “Been  doinJ  a  bit  of  consultinJ  work  for  a Jentleman  there.
Complicated fellow. Dead now. Had many facets, but now he'll Jo down in
history as Must another damn Chinese warlord who didn't make the Jrade. ,t
is remarkable, love,” he said, lookinJ at Nell  for the first  time, “how  much
money you can make shovellinJ back the tide. ,n  the end you need to Jet
out while  the JettinJ  is  Jood. Not  very  honourable, ,  suppose, but then,
there is no honour amonJ consultants.”

       Nell   did  not  imaJine  that  Constable Moore  wanted  to  Jet  into  a
detailed discussion of recent events, so she chanJed the subMect. “, think ,
have finally worked  out what you were tryinJ  to  tell me, years aJo, about
beinJ intelliJent,” she said.

399
       The Constable briJhtened all at once. “Pleased to hear it.”

       “The Vickys  have an elaborate code of morals and conduct. ,t Jrew out
of the moral sTualor of an earlier Jeneration, Must as the oriJinal Victorians
were preceded by the GeorJians and the ReJency. The old Juard believe in
that code because they came to it the hard way. They raise their children to
believe in  that  code—but  their  children  believe it  for   entirely  different
reasons.”

       “They   believe  it,”    the  Constable said,  “because  they  have  been
indoctrinated to believe it.”

       “Yes.  Some of  them never challenJe it—they  Jrow  up  to be  small-
minded people, who can tell you what they believe but not why they believe
it. Others become disillusioned by the hypocrisy of the society and rebel—
as did Eli]abeth Finkle-McGraw.”

       “Which   path  do   you  intend  to   take,  Nell?”   said  the  Constable,
soundinJ very interested. “Conformity or rebellion?”

       “Neither  one. Both ways are simple-minded—they are only for people
who cannot cope with contradiction and ambiJuity.”

       “Ah!  Excellent!”  the Constable exclaimed. As punctuation, he slapped
the  Jround  with   his  free  hand,  sendinJ  up  a   shower of   sparks  and
transmittinJ a powerful shock throuJh the Jround to Nell's feet.

       “,   suspect that Lord  Finkle-McGraw,  beinJ an  intelliJent  man, sees
throuJh  all  of  the  hypocrisy  in   his  society, but  upholds  its  principles
anyway, because that is what is best in the lonJ run. And , suspect that he
has been worryinJ about how best to inculcate this stance in younJ people
who cannot understand, as he does, its historical antecedents—which miJht
explain why  he has taken an  interest in  me. The Primer  may have been
Finkle-McGraw's  idea  to  beJin  with—a   first  attempt  to  Jo  about  this
systematically.”

400
       “The  Duke  plays his cards close,”  Constable Moore said,  “and so  ,
cannot say whether your suppositions are correct. But , will admit it  hanJs
toJether nicely.”

       “Thank  you.”

       “What  do you intend to do with yourself, now that you have pieced all
of this toJether? A few  more years' education and polishinJ will place you
in a position to take the Oath.”

       “,  am, of course, aware that , have favorable prospects in the Atlantan
phyle,” Nell  said, “but ,  do not think that it  would be fittinJ  for me to  take
the straiJht and narrow path. , am JoinJ to China now to seek my fortune.”

       “Well,”   Constable  Moore  said, “look   out  for   the Fists.”   His  Ja]e
wandered over his battered and filthy armor and came to rest on the floatinJ
helmet. “They are cominJ now.”

       The best explorers, like Burton,  made every effort to blend in.  ,n this
spirit, Nell  stopped at a public M.C., doffed her lonJ dress, and compiled a
new set of clothes—a navy blue skin-tiJht coverall embla]oned with  SH,T
HAPPENS in  pulsatinJ oranJe letters. She swapped her old clothes for  a
pair of powered skates on the waterfront, and then headed straiJht for the
Causeway. ,t rose Jently into the air for  a few miles, and then the PudonJ
Economic =one came into view at her feet, and ShanJhai beyond that, and
she suddenly beJan to pick up speed and had to cut the skates' power assist.
She'd passed over the watershed now. Nell was alone in China.


                 The Hackworths  have a family reunion;  Hackworth
                  strikes out on his quest; an unexpected companion. 



Atlantis/Seattle was desiJned small and to the point; the narrow, convoluted
straits of PuJet Sound, already so full of natural islands, did not leave much
room for   artificial   ones. So they  had  made it  rather  lonJ  and  slender,
parallel to the currents and the shippinJ lanes, and been rather stinJy when

401
it  came to  the  parks,  meadows, heaths, Jentleman  farms, and  country
estates. Much of the Seattle area was still  sufficiently  rich,  civili]ed,   and
polite that New Atlantans did not obMect to livinJ there, and little Victorian
mini-claves were  scattered about the place, particularly  east of  the lake,
around the misty forest domains of the software khans. Gwen and Fiona had
taken a townhouse in one of these areas.

       These tiny bits of  New Atlantis  stood out from the surroundinJ forest
in the same way that a vicar in morninJ coat and winJ collar would have in
the cave of the Drummers. The  prevailinJ  architecture here, amonJ those
who had not adopted neo-Victorian precepts, was distinctly subterranean; as
if these people were somehow ashamed of their own humanity  and could
not bear to fell  even a handful of  the immense DouJlas firs  that marched
monotonously up the tumblinJ  slopes toward the  fro]en,  sodden ridJe of
the Cascades. Even when it was half buried, a house wasn't even a proper
house; it was an association of modules, scattered about here and there and
connected by bree]eways or tunnels. Stuck toJether properly and built on a
rise, these modules miJht  have added up  to a  house of  substance, even
Jrandeur; but to Hackworth, ridinJ throuJh  the territory on his way to visit
his family,   it  was  all  depressinJ  and confusinJ.  Ten  years amonJ  the
Drummers had not affected his neo-Victorian aesthetics. He could not tell
where one  house left  off  and  the next  one  beJan, the houses were  all
intertanJled with one another like neurons in the brain.

       His  mind's eye aJain seemed to sei]e control of  his visual  cortex; he
could not see the firs  anymore, Must axons and dendrites hanJinJ in black
three-dimensional space, packets of rod  loJic  maneuverinJ amonJ  them
like space probes, meetinJ and copulatinJ amonJ the nerve fibers.

       ,t  was a  bit  too aJJressive to  be a reverie  and too  abstract to be a
hallucination. ,t didn't  really clear away until a Just of  cold mist hit him  in
his face, he opened his eyes, and reali]ed that Kidnapper had stopped after
emerJinJ from the trees at the crest of a mossy ridJeline. Below him was a
rocky bowl  with  a few cobblestone streets sketched out in a Jrid, a Jreen
park lined with red Jeraniums, a church with a white  steeple, whitewashed
four-story GeorJian  buildinJs  surrounded by  black  wrouJht-iron  fences.

402
The security Jrid was tenuous and feeble; the software khans were at least
as Jood at that  kind of  thinJ  as Her  MaMesty's specialists, and so a New
Atlantis clave in this  area could rely on the neiJhbors to shoulder much of
that burden.

       Kidnapper   picked  its  way   carefully  down   the  steep declivity    as
Hackworth  looked  out  over  the  tiny  clave,  musinJ  at  how  familiar   it
seemed. Since leavinJ the Drummers, he hadn't Jone more than ten minutes
without beinJ  sei]ed  by a  feelinJ  of  déMà vu, and now it was especially
stronJ.  Perhaps this  was  because, to   some  deJree, all   New  Atlantis
settlements looked alike.  But  he  suspected that he had  seen this place,
somehow, in his communications with Fiona over the years.

       A  bell  clanJed  once or  twice,  and teenaJed Jirls,  dressed in  plaid
uniform skirts,  beJan to  emerJe from a  domed school. Hackworth  knew
that it was Fiona's school, and that she was not entirely happy there. After
the crush of  Jirls  had Jone out of  the  place, he rode Kidnapper  into the
school yard and sauntered once around the buildinJ, Ja]inJ in the windows.
Without much trouble he saw his dauJhter, sittinJ  at a table in the library,
hunched over a book, evidently as part of some disciplinary action.

       He wanted so badly to  Jo in and put his  arms around her, because he
knew that she had spent many hours sufferinJ  like punishments, and that
she was  a  lonely  Jirl.   But   he  was  in  New  Atlantis,   and  there  were
proprieties to be observed. First thinJs first.

       Gwendolyn's townhouse was only a few blocks away. Hackworth ranJ
the bell,  determined to observe all  of  the formalities  now  that he  was a
stranJer in the house.

       “May  ,  ask what  your visit  is  reJardinJ?” asked the parlourmaid, as
Hackworth spun his card onto the salver. Hackworth didn't like this woman,
who was named Amelia, because Fiona didn't like her, and Fiona didn't like
her  because Gwen  had  Jiven  her   some disciplinary   authority   in  the
household, and Amelia was the sort who relished havinJ it.

403
       He tried  not to confuse himself  by wonderinJ  how he could possibly
know all of these thinJs.

       “Business,” Hackworth said pleasantly. “Family business.”

       Amelia  was halfway  up  the stairs when her  eyes finally  focused on
Hackworth's card. She nearly dropped the salver and had to  clutch at  the
banister with one hand in order to  keep her balance. She fro]e there for a
few moments, tryinJ   to resist  the temptation to  turn  around, and finally
surrendered to it. The expression on her face was one of  perfect loathinJ
mixed with fascination.

       “Please carry out your duties,” Hackworth said, “and dispense with the
vulJar theatrics.”

       Amelia,  lookinJ crestfallen, stormed up the stairs with the tainted card.
There followed  a Jood  deal of  muffled  commotion upstairs. After  a few
minutes, Amelia  ventured  as  far  down  as the  landinJ  and  encouraJed
Hackworth to make himself comfortable in the parlor. He did so, notinJ that
in his absence, Gwendolyn had been able to consummate all of  the lonJ-
term furniture-buyinJ strateJies she had spent so much time plottinJ durinJ
the early years of  their  marriaJe. Wives  and widows  of  secret aJents in
Protocol Enforcement could rely on beinJ well cared for, and Gwen had not
allowed his salary to sit around collectinJ dust.

       His   ex-wife  descended the  stairway  cautiously,  stood  outside  the
beveled-Jlass parlor doors for a minute  peerinJ at him  throuJh the Jau]e
curtains, and finally  slipped  into the  room without  meetinJ  his Ja]e  and
took a seat rather far away from him. “Hello, Mr. Hackworth,” she said.

       “Mrs.  Hackworth. Or is it back to Miss Lloyd?”

       “,t  is.”

       “Ah,   that's hard.” When  Hackworth heard the  name Miss Lloyd,  he
thouJht of their courtship.

404
       They sat there for a minute or so, not sayinJ anythinJ, Must listeninJ to
the ponderous ratchetinJ of the Jrandfather clock.

       “All    riJht,”   Hackworth   said,  “,   won't   trouble  you  talkinJ   about
extenuatinJ circumstances, as , don't ask for  your  forJiveness, and in  all
honesty ,'m not sure that , deserve it.”

       “Thank  you for that consideration.”

       “,  would  like  you to know,  Miss Lloyd,  that ,  am sympathetic to the
step you have taken in securinJ a divorce and harbour no bitterness on that
account.”

       “That  is reassurinJ to know.”

       “You   should also  know  that  whatever behaviour  ,  enJaJed  in,  as
inexcusable as it  was, was not  motivated  by  reMection of you or of  our
marriaJe. ,t  was  not, in  fact,  a  reflection  upon you  at  all,  but  rather a
reflection upon myself.”

       “Thank  you for clarifyinJ  that point.”

       “,  reali]e  that any hope , miJht harbour in my breast of rekindlinJ our
former relationship, sincere as it miJht be, is futile, and so , will not trouble
you after today.”

       “,  cannot tell  you how  relieved ,  am to hear that you  understand the
situation so completely.”

       “However,  , would like  to be of service to you and Fiona in helpinJ to
resolve any loose ends.”

       “You  are very kind. , shall Jive you my lawyer's card.”

       “And,  of  course, , look forward to  reestablishinJ some sort of contact
with my dauJhter.”

405
       The conversation, which  had been runninJ as smoothly as a machine
to this point,  now veered off  track and crashed. Gwendolyn reddened and
stiffened.

       “You—you  bastard.”

       The  front  door  opened. Fiona  stepped into  the  foyer  carryinJ  her
schoolbooks. Amelia was there immediately, maneuverinJ around with her
back to the foyer doors, blockinJ Fiona's view, talkinJ  to her in  low  anJry
tones.

       Hackworth  heard his dauJhter's voice. ,t was a lovely  voice, a husky
alto,  and he  would  have  recoJni]ed   it  anywhere.  “Don't  lie   to  me,  ,
recoJnised his chevaline!” she said, and finally  shouldered Amelia  out of
the way,  burst into  the parlor,  all  lanky  and awkward  and beautiful,  an
incarnation of  Moy. She took two  steps across the oriental  ruJ  and then
launched herself full-lenJth across the settee into her father's arms, where
she lay for some minutes alternately weepinJ and lauJhinJ.

       Gwen had to  be escorted from the room  by Amelia,  who came back
immediately and stationed herself nearby, hands clasped behind back like a
military  sentry, observinJ  Hackworth's  every  move. Hackworth  couldn't
imaJine what they suspected he miJht be capable of—incest in the parlor?
But there was no point in spoilinJ the moment by thinkinJ of JallinJ thinJs,
and so he shut Amelia out of his mind.

       Father and dauJhter were allowed to converse for a Tuarter of an hour,
really Must TueuinJ up subMects for future conversation. By that time, Gwen
had recovered her composure enouJh  to reenter  the room,  and she and
Amelia  stood shoulder-to-shoulder, TuiverinJ   in  sympathetic resonance,
until Gwen interrupted.

       “Fiona,   your—father—and ,   were  in  the  midst  of  a  very   serious
discussion when  you  burst in   on  us. Please leave  us alone  for  a  few
minutes.”

406
       Fiona did, reluctantly. Gwen resumed her former position, and Amelia
backed out of the  room. Hackworth  noticed that Gwen had fetched some
documents, bound up in red tape.

       “These are papers settinJ out  the terms of  our divorce,  includinJ  all
conditions relatinJ  to Fiona,”  she said. “You are already  in violation,  ,'m
afraid. Of course, this can be forJiven, as your lack of a forwardinJ address
as such made it impossible  for  us to acTuaint you  with  this information.
Needless to say, it is imperative for  you to  familiarise yourself  with  these
documents before darkeninJ my door aJain.”

       “Naturally,”  Hackworth said. “Thank you for retaininJ them for me.”

       “,f  you will  be so Jood as to withdraw from these premises—”

       “Of  course. Good day,” Hackworth  said, took the roll  of  papers from
Gwen's tremblinJ hand, and let himself out briskly.  He was a bit surprised
when he heard Amelia callinJ to him from the doorway.

       “Mr.   Hackworth.   Miss  Lloyd   wishes  to  know  whether  you  have
established a   new  residence,  so  that  your   personal  effects   may  be
forwarded.”

       “None as yet,” Hackworth said. “,'m  in transit.”

       Amelia  briJhtened. “,n transit to where?”

       “Oh,  ,  don't really  know,”  Hackworth  said. A  movement cauJht his
eye and he saw Fiona framed in a second-story window. She was undoinJ
the latches, raisinJ the sash. “,'m on a Tuest of sorts.”

       “A  Tuest for what, Mr. Hackworth?”

       “Can't  say precisely. You know, top secret and all  that. SomethinJ to
do with an alchemist. Who knows, maybe there'll be faeries and hobJoblins
too, before it's all over. ,'ll be happy to fill  you in when ,  return. 8ntil  then,
please ask Miss Lloyd if  she would be so understandinJ as to retain those

407
personal effects for Must a bit lonJer. ,t can't possibly take more than another
ten years or so.”

       And  with  that, Hackworth prodded Kidnapper forward,  movinJ  at an
extremely deliberate pace.

       Fiona was on a velocipede with smart wheels that made short work of
the cobblestone road. She cauJht up with her father Must short of the security
Jrid. Mother  and Amelia  had Must materiali]ed a block  behind them in  a
half-lane car, and the sudden sensation of danJer inspired Fiona to make an
impetuous dive   from   the  saddle  of   her  velocipede  onto  Kidnapper's
hindTuarters, like a cowboy in a movie switchinJ horses in midJallop.  Her
skirts, poorly adapted to cowboy  maneuvers, Jot all fouled up  around her
leJs, and she ended up slunJ over Kidnapper's back like  a sack of  beans,
one hand clutchinJ the vestiJial  knob where its tail  would  have been if it
were a horse, and the other arm thrown round her father's waist.

       “,  love  you, Mother!”  she shouted, as they rode throuJh the Jrid and
out of the Murisdiction of New Atlantis family  law. “Can't  say the same for
you, Amelia! But ,'ll  be back soon, don't worry about me! Good-bye!” And
then the ferns and mist closed behind them, and they were alone in the deep
forest.


                     Carl Hollywood  takes the Oath; stroll along the
                  Thames; an encounter with  Lord Finkle-McGraw  .


Carl took  the Oath at Westminster Abbey on  a surprisinJly  balmy day in
April  and  afterward  went  for  a stride  down  the  river,  headinJ not  too
directly  toward a  reception  that had  been arranJed in  his  honor  at  the
Hopkins Theatre near  Leicester STuare. Even without  a  pedomotive, he
walked as fast as many people MoJJed. Ever since his first visit to London as
a malnourished theatre student, he had preferred walkinJ to any other way
of JettinJ   around the place.  WalkinJ,  especially alonJ  the Embankment
where fellow-pedestrians were relatively   few, also  Jave him  freedom to
smoke biJ old authentic ciJars or the occasional briar pipe. -ust because he

408
was a Victorian didn't  mean he had to  Jive up  his peculiarities; Tuite  the
opposite, in   fact.  CruisinJ  alonJ   past old   shrapnel-pocked Cleopatra's
Needle in  a  comet-like  corona  of  his  own  roilinJ,   viscous  smoke,  he
thouJht that he miJht Jet to like this.

       A  Jentleman in a top  hat was standinJ on the railinJ,  Ja]inJ  stolidly
across the water, and as Carl drew  closer, he could  see that it  was Lord
Alexander ChunJ-Sik Finkle-McGraw, who, a day or two earlier, had stated
durinJ a cinephone conversation that he should like  to  meet him  face-to-
face in the near future for a chat.

       Carl Hollywood,  rememberinJ his new tribal affiliation,  went so far as
to  doff   his  hat  and  bow.  Finkle-McGraw   acknowledJed  the  JreetinJ
somewhat distractedly.  “Please accept  my  sincere  conJratulations,  Mr.
Hollywood. Welcome to the phyle.”

       “Thank  you.”

       “,  reJret that , have not been able to attend any of your productions at
the  Hopkins—my   friends   who   have  could   hardly   have  been  more
complimentary.”

       “Your  friends are too kind,”  said Carl Hollywood.  He was still  a little
unsure of the etiTuette. To accept the compliment at face value would have
been boastful; to imply that His Grace's friends were incompetent MudJes of
theatre was not much of an improvement; he settled for the less danJerous
accusation that these friends had a superfluity of Joodness.

       Finkle-McGraw  detached himself from  the railinJ  and beJan to walk
alonJ the river, keepinJ a brisk pace for a man of his aJe.

       “,  daresay that you shall make a pri]ed addition to our phyle, which, as
brilliantly  as it  shines in the fields  of commerce and science, wants more
artists.”

       Not  wantinJ to  Moin in criticism of the tribe he'd Must sworn a solemn
Oath to   uphold,  Carl  pursed  his  lips  and  mulled  over  some  possible

409
responses.

       Finkle-McGraw  continued, “Do you suppose that we fail to encouraJe
our own children  to pursue the arts, or fail  to attract enouJh men such as
yourself, or perhaps both?”

       “With  all due respect, Your Grace, , do not necessarily aJree with your
premise. New Atlantis has many fine artists.”

       “Oh,  come now. Why  do all of  them come from  outside the tribe, as
you did? Really, Mr.  Hollywood,  would  you have taken the Oath at  all if
your prominence as a theatrical producer had not made it advantaJeous for
you to do so?”

       “,  think  ,  will  choose to interpret your  Tuestion as part of a Socratic
dialoJue for my edification,”  Carl Hollywood  said carefully, “and not as an
alleJation of   insincerity  on my  part.  As  a  matter of  fact,  Must before ,
encountered you, , was enMoyinJ my ciJar, and lookinJ  about at London,
and thinkinJ about Must how well it all suits me.”

       “,t   suits you  well  because you are of  a certain aJe now.  You are a
successful and established artist. The raJJed bohemian life holds no charm
for you anymore. But would you  have reached your current position if you
had not lived that life when you were younJer?”

       “Now  that you put it that way,” Carl  said, “, aJree that we miJht try to
make some provision, in the future, for younJ bohemians—”

       “,t   wouldn't  work,”  Finkle-McGraw   said. “,'ve  been thinkinJ   about
this for years. , had the same idea: Set up a sort of younJ artistic bohemian
theme park, sprinkled  around in  all  the  maMor cities, where younJ New
Atlantans who were so inclined could  conJreJate and be subversive when
they  were  in   the  mood.  The  whole   idea  was  self-contradictory.  Mr.
Hollywood, ,  have devoted much effort, durinJ the last decade or so, to the
systematic encouraJement of subversiveness.”

410
       “You  have? Are  you not  concerned that our younJ  subversives will
miJrate to other phyles?”

       ,f  Carl  Hollywood  could  have kicked  himself in  the  arse, he would
have done so as soon as finishinJ  that  sentence. He had forJotten about
Eli]abeth   Finkle-McGraw's  recent  and   hiJhly   publici]ed   defection  to
CryptNet. But the Duke took it serenely.

       “Some  of them  will,  as the case of  my JranddauJhter demonstrates.
But what does it really  mean when such a younJ person moves to another
phyle? ,t means that they have outJrown youthful  credulity  and no lonJer
wish to belonJ to a tribe  simply because it is the path of least resistance—
they have  developed principles,  they  are concerned with  their  personal
inteJrity. ,t  means, in short, that they are ripe to become members in Jood
standinJ of New Atlantis—as soon as they develop the wisdom to see that it
is, in the end, the best of all possible tribes.”

       “Your  strateJy was much too subtle for me to  follow.  , thank you for
explaininJ it.  You encouraJe subversiveness because you think that it will
have an effect opposite to what one miJht naively suppose.”

       “Yes. And that's the whole point of beinJ an ETuity Lord, you know—
to look after the interests of the society as a whole instead of floJJinJ one's
own company, or whatever. At any rate, this brinJs us to the subMect of the
advertisement ,   placed in   the  ractives  section  of   the  Times and  our
conseTuent cinephone conversation.”

       “Yes,”   Carl   Hollywood   said,  “you   are  lookinJ    for  ractors  who
performed in a proMect called the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.”

       “The  Primer was my  idea. , commissioned it. ,  paid the ractinJ  fees.
Of course, owinJ to the way the media system is orJanised, , had no way to
determine the identity of the ractors to whom , was sendinJ the fees—hence
the need for a public advertisement.”

       “Your  Grace, , should tell you immediately—and would have told you
on  the  cinephone, had  you  not  insisted  that  we  defer  all   substantive

411
discussion to a face-to-face—that ,  myself  did  not ract  in  the Primer. A
friend of  mine did. When ,  saw the advertisement, , undertook to respond
on her behalf.”

       “,    understand   that   ractors   are   freTuently   pursued   by   overly
appreciative members of their  audience,” said Finkle-McGraw,  “and  so ,
suppose , understand why you have chosen to act as intermediary in  this
case. Let me assure you that my motives are perfectly beniJn.”

       Carl  adopted  a wounded  look.  “Your   Grace!  ,  would  never  have
supposed otherwise. , am arroJatinJ this role to  myself, not to  protect the
younJ lady  in  Tuestion from   any supposed maliJnity  on  your  part,  but
simply because her current circumstances make establishinJ contact with
her a somewhat troublesome business.”

       “Then pray tell me what you know about the younJ woman.”

       Carl Jave the ETuity Lord a brief  description of Miranda's relationship
with the Primer.

       Finkle-McGraw  was keenly interested in how much time Miranda had
spent in the Primer each week. “,f  your  estimates are even approximately
accurate, this younJ woman must have sinJlehandedly done at least nine-
tenths of the ractinJ associated with that copy of the Primer.”

       “That  copy? Do you mean to say there were others?”

       Finkle-McGraw  walked on  silently for  a few moments, then resumed
in a Tuieter voice. “There were three copies in all. The first one went to my
JranddauJhter—as you will   appreciate, ,  tell  you  this  in  confidence. A
second went to Fiona, the dauJhter of the artifex who created it. The third
fell into the hands of Nell, a little thete Jirl.

       “To  make  a lonJ   story short,  the  three Jirls  have  turned out  very
differently. Eli]abeth  is rebellious and hiJh-spirited  and lost interest in the
Primer several years aJo. Fiona is  briJht  but depressed, a classic manic-
depressive artist. Nell, on the other hand, is a most promisinJ younJ lady.

412
       “,  prepared an analysis of the Jirls'  usaJe habits, which  were larJely
obscured by the inherent secrecy of  the media system, but which  can be
inferred from the  bills we  paid to hire the  ractors. ,t became clear that, in
the case of   Eli]abeth,   the  ractinJ  was  done by   hundreds of   different
performers. ,n Fiona's case, the bills were strikinJly lower because much of
the ractinJ was done by someone who did not charJe money for his or her
services—probably her father. But  that's a different  story. ,n  Nell's  case,
virtually all  of the ractinJ was done by the same person.”

       “,t  sounds,” Carl said, “as if  my friend  established a relationship with
Nell's copy—”

       “And  by extension, with Nell,”  said Lord Finkle-McGraw.

       Carl said, “May ,  inTuire as to why you wish to contact the ractor?”

       “Because she is  a central part  of what  is JoinJ  on  here,” said  Lord
Finkle-McGraw, “which  ,  did  not expect. ,t was not  a part of the  oriJinal
plan that the ractor would be important.”

       “She did it,”  Carl Hollywood  said, “by sacrificinJ  her career and much
of her life.  ,t is  important for you  to understand, Your Grace, that she was
not merely Nell's tutor. She became Nell's mother.”

       These words seemed to strike  Lord Finkle-McGraw   Tuite forcefully.
His stride faltered, and he ambled alonJ the riverbank for some time, lost in
thouJht.

       “You  Jave me to believe, several minutes aJo, that establishinJ contact
with the ractor in Tuestion would not be a trivial process,” he said finally, in
Tuieter voice. “,s she no lonJer associated with your troupe?”

       “She took a leave of absence several years aJo in order to concentrate
on Nell and the Primer.”

       “,   see,” said the ETuity  Lord, leaninJ  into  the words a little   bit and
turninJ it  into an exclamation. He  was JettinJ excited. “Mr.  Hollywood,  ,

413
hope you will  not be offended by my indelicacy in  inTuirinJ as to whether
this has been a paid leave of absence.”

       “Had  it been necessary, , would have underwritten it. ,nstead there is
another backer.”

       “Another    backer,”   repeated  Finkle-McGraw.   He   was   obviously
fascinated, and sliJhtly   alarmed, by  the  use of   financial  MarJon in this
context.

       “The  transaction was fairly simple, as , suppose all transactions are au
fond,” said Carl Hollywood.  “Miranda  wanted to locate Nell. Conventional
thinkinJ   dictates  that  this   is   impossible.  There   are,  however,  some
unconventional thinkers who would  maintain  that it  can be done throuJh
unconscious, nonrational processes. There is a tribe called the Drummers
who normally live underwater—”

       “,  am familiar with  them,” said Lord Finkle-McGraw.

       “Miranda  Moined the Drummers four years aJo,” Carl  said. “She had
entered into a partnership. The two other partners were a Jentleman of my
acTuaintance, also in the theatrical business, and a financial backer.”

       “What  did the backer hope to Jain from it?”

       “A   leased line to  the collective  unconscious,” said Carl  Hollywood.
“He   thouJht   it   would    be  to   the   entertainment  industry   what   the
philosopher's stone was to alchemy.”

       “And  the results?”

       “We have all been waitinJ to hear from Miranda.”

       “You  have heard nothinJ at all?”

       “Only  in my dreams,” Carl Hollywood  said.

414
                  Nell's passage through Pudong; she happens upon
                                    the offices of Madame Ping; 
                                       interview  with the same. 



ShanJhai proper could be Jlimpsed only throuJh vertical apertures between
the hiJh buildinJs of  the PudonJ Economic =one as Nell skated westward.
Downtown PudonJ erupted from the flat paddy-land on the east bank of the
HuanJ Pu. Almost all of  the skyscrapers made use of mediatronic buildinJ
materials. Some bore the  streamlined characters of the  -apanese writinJ
system, rendered in sophisticated color  schemes, but most of  them were
written in  the denser hiJh-resolution characters used by the Chinese, and
these tended to be stroked out in fiery red, or in black  on a backJround of
that color.

       The AnJlo-Americans  had their  Manhattan, the -apanese had Tokyo.
HonJ KonJ was a nice piece of work, but it was essentially Western. When
the Overseas Chinese came back to the homeland to build their monument
to enterprise,  they had  done  it  here, and  they  had done  it  biJJer   and
briJhter, and  unTuestionably redder, than any  of  those other  cities. The
nanotechnoloJical trick of  makinJ  sturdy structures that were liJhter  than
air had come alonJ  Must at the riJht time, as all  of  the last  paddies were
beinJ replaced by  immense concrete foundations,  and a canopy  of  new
construction  had  bloomed   above  the  first-Jeneration   underJrowth  of
seventy- and eiJhty-story  buildinJs.  This  new architecture was  naturally
larJe and  ellipsoidal,   typically  consistinJ  of   a  huJe neon-rimmed  ball
impaled on a spike, so PudonJ was biJJer and denser a thousand feet above
the Jround than it was at street level.

       Seen from the  apex of the biJ  arch in  the Causeway throuJh several
miles of bad air, the view was curiously flattened and faded, as if the whole
scene had been woven into a  fabulously  complex brocade that had been
allowed to Jather dust for  several decades and then been hunJ in front of
Nell, about ten feet away. The sun had Jone down not lonJ before and the
sky was  still  a dim  oranJe fadinJ  up  into  purple,  divided  into  irreJular
seJments by half a do]en  pillars of  smoke spurtinJ straiJht  up out  of the

415
hori]on  and toward the dark polluted vault of  the heavens, many miles off
to the west, somewhere out in the silk  and tea districts between ShanJhai
and Su]hou.

       As  she power-skated down the western slope of the arch and crossed
the coastline of  China, the thunderhead of neon reached above her head,
spread out to embrace her, developed into three dimensions—and she was
still  several miles away  from  it.  The coastal neiJhborhoods consisted of
block after  block of  reinforced-concrete apartment buildinJs, four  to  five
stories hiJh, lookinJ  older than the Great Wall thouJh their  real aJe could
not have exceeded a few  decades, and decorated on the ends facinJ  the
street with larJe cartoonish billboards, some mediatronic, most Must painted
on. For the first kilometer or so, most of these were tarJeted at businessmen
Must cominJ in from New Chusan, and in particular from the New Atlantis
Clave. GlancinJ at  these billboards as she went by  them, Nell  concluded
that visitors  from  New  Atlantis   played an  important  role  in  supportinJ
casinos and  bordellos,  both   the  old-fashioned  variety  and  the   newer
scripted-fantasy emporia, where you could be the star in  a little  play  you
wrote yourself. Nell slowed down to examine several of these, memori]inJ
the addresses of ones with especially new or well-executed siJns.

       She had no clear plan in  mind yet. All   she knew was that she had to
keep movinJ  purposefully.  Then the  younJ  men sTuattinJ on  the  curbs
talkinJ into their cellphones would keep eyeinJ her but leave her alone. The
moment she stopped or looked the tiniest bit uncertain, they would descend.

       The dense wet air alonJ the HuanJ Pu was supportinJ millions of tons
of air buoys, and Nell felt every kiloJram  of their weiJht pressinJ upon her
ribs  and  shoulders as  she  skated  up  and  down   the  main  waterfront
thorouJhfare, tryinJ   to  maintain her  momentum  and her  false sense of
purposefulness. This was the Coastal Republic, which appeared to have no
fixed principles other than that money talked and that it was a Jood thinJ to
Jet rich. Every tribe  in the world  seemed to have its own skyscraper here.
Some, like New Atlantis,  were not actively  recruitinJ and simply  used the
si]e  and maJnificence  of  their  buildinJs  as a monument  to  themselves.
Others, like   the Boers,  the  Parsis, the  -ews,  went  for  the  understated

416
approach, and in PudonJ anythinJ understated was more or less invisible.
Still others—the Mormons, the First Distributed Republic, and the Chinese
Coastal Republic itself—used every sTuare inch of their mediatronic walls
to proselyti]e.

       The only  phyle that didn't seem to appreciate the ecumenical spirit of
the place  was the  Celestial  KinJdom  itself.  Nell   stumbled across their
territory, half  a sTuare block surrounded with  a stucco-sheathed masonry
wall, circular  Jates here and there, and an old three-story structure inside,
done in hiJh MinJ  style  with eaves that curved way up at the corners and
sculpted draJons alonJ  the ridJeline  of  the roof.  The  place was so  tiny
compared to the rest of PudonJ that it looked  as if you  miJht trip  over it.
The Jates were Juarded by men in armor, presumably backed up by other,
less obvious defensive systems.

       Nell  was fairly  certain that she was beinJ followed, unobtrusively, by
at least three younJ men who had locked on to her durinJ her initial passaJe
in from the coast, and who were waitinJ to find  out whether she really had
somewhere to Jo or was Must fakinJ it. She had already made her way from
one end of the waterfront to  the other, pretendinJ to be a tourist  who Must
wanted to take in a view of the Bund across the river. She was now headinJ
back into the heart of  downtown PudonJ, where she had better look  as if
she were doinJ somethinJ.

       PassinJ by  the Jrand entrance to  one of  the skyscrapers—a Coastal
Republic edifice, not barbarian turf—she recoJni]ed its  mediaJlyphic loJo
from one of the siJns she had seen on the way into town.

       Nell  could at least fill out an application without committinJ  herself. ,t
would allow  her to  kill  an hour in  relatively  safe and clean surroundinJs.
The important thinJ, as DoMo had tauJht her lonJ aJo in a different context,
was not to stop; without movement she could do nothinJ.

       Alas, Madame PinJ's office  suite was closed. A few liJhts  were on in
the back, but the doors were locked and no receptionist was on duty. Nell
did not know whether to be amused or annoyed; whoever heard of a brothel

417
that closed down after dark?  But then these were only  the administrative
offices.

       She  loitered in   the lobby  for   a few   minutes, then  cauJht a  down
elevator. -ust as the doors were closinJ, someone Mumped into the lobby and
slammed the button, openinJ them back up  aJain. A  younJ Chinese man
with  a  small,  slender body,  larJe  head,  neatly  dressed, carryinJ  some
papers. “Pardon me,” he said. “Did you reTuire somethinJ?”

       “,'m  here to apply for a Mob,” Nell said.

       The man's eyes traveled up and down her body in a coolly professional
fashion, almost completely  devoid of  prurience, startinJ  and stoppinJ on
her face. “As a performer,” he said. The intonation was somewhere between
a Tuestion and a declaration.

       “As  a scriptwriter,” she said.

       8nexpectedly, he broke into a Jrin.

       “,  have Tualifications that , will explain in detail.”

       “We have writers. We contract for them on the network.”

       “,'m   surprised.  How  can  a  contract  writer  in   Minnesota  possibly
provide your clients with the personali]ed service they reTuire?”

       “You  could almost certainly Jet a Mob as a performer,” said the younJ
man. “You would start toniJht. Good pay.”

       “-ust  by lookinJ  at the billboards on the way in,  , could  see that your
customers aren't payinJ for bodies. They are payinJ for  ideas. That's your
value added, riJht?”

       “Pardon me?” said the younJ man, JrinninJ aJain.

       “Your    value  added.  The   reason  you   can  charJe  more   than  a
whorehouse, pardon my lanJuaJe, is  that you  provide  a scripted fantasy

418
scenario tailored to the client's reTuirements. ,  can do that for  you,”  Nell
said. “, know these people, and , can make you a lot of money.”

       “You  know what people?”

       “The Vickys.  , know them inside and out,” Nell said.

       “Please  come  inside,”  said  the  younJ  man,  JesturinJ  toward  the
diamondoid door  with   MADAME    P,NG'S  written  on  it  in   red letters.
“Would you care for tea?”

         

“There are only  two industries. This has always been true,”  said Madame
PinJ, enfoldinJ a lovely  porcelain teacup in her withered  finJers, the two-
inch finJernails  interleavinJ neatly  like the  pinions of  a raptor foldinJ  its
winJs after a lonJ hard day of cruisinJ  the thermals. “There is the industry
of thinJs, and the industry  of entertainment. The industry of  thinJs comes
first. ,t  keeps us alive.  But  makinJ  thinJs is  easy now that  we have the
Feed. This is not a very interestinJ business anymore.

       “After   people have  the thinJs  they  need to live,  everythinJ  else  is
entertainment. EverythinJ. This is Madame PinJ's business.”

       Madame PinJ had an office  on the hundred-and-eleventh floor with a
nice unobstructed view across the HuanJ Pu and into downtown ShanJhai.
When it wasn't foJJy,  she could even see the facade of her theatre, which
was on a side street a couple of blocks  in from  the Bund, its  mediatronic
marTuee JlowinJ patchily throuJh  the dun limbs  of an old  sycamore tree.
She had  a telescope mounted  in  one  of  her  windows,  fixed  upon  the
theatre's entrance, and notinJ Nell's curiosity, she encouraJed her to look
throuJh it.

       Nell   had  never looked   throuJh  a  real  telescope before.  ,t  had  a
tendency to MiJJle and Jo out  of focus,  it  didn't ]oom,  and  panninJ was
tricky. But for all  that, the imaJe Tuality was a lot better than photoJraphic,
and she Tuickly forJot herself and beJan sweepinJ it back and forth across

419
the city. She checked out the little Celestial KinJdom Clave in  the heart of
the old city, where a couple of Mandarins stood on a ]iJ]aJ bridJe across a
pond, contemplatinJ a swarm of  Jolden carp, wispy  silver  beards trailinJ
down over the colorful  silk  of  their lapels,  blue sapphire buttons on their
caps flashinJ  as  they nodded  their  heads. She looked  into   a hiJh-rise
buildinJ  farther  inland,  apparently  a  foreiJn  concession of  some  type,
where some Euros were holdinJ a cocktail party, some venturinJ  onto the
balcony with Jlasses of wine and doinJ  some eavesdroppinJ of their own.
Finally  she  leveled  the  'scope  toward  the  hori]on,   out   past the  vast
danJerous triad-ridden suburbs, where millions of ShanJhai's poor had been
forcibly   banished to   make way   for   hiJh-rises.  Beyond  that  was  real
aJricultural land, a fractal  network of canals and creeks JlimmerinJ like  a
Jolden net as they reflected the lambency of the sunset, and beyond that, as
always, a few scattered pillars of smoke in the ultimate distance, where the
Fists of RiJhteous Harmony were burninJ the foreiJn devils' Feed lines.

       “You  are a curious Jirl,”  Madame PinJ said. “That is natural. But you
must never let  any other person—especially a client—see your  curiosity.
Never seek information. Sit Tuietly and let them brinJ it  to you. What they
conceal tells you more than what they reveal. Do you understand?”

       “Yes, madam,”  Nell said, turninJ  toward her interlocutor  with  a little
curtsy. Rather than tryinJ to do Chinese etiTuette and makinJ a hash of it,
she was takinJ the Victorian route, which worked Must as well. For purposes
of  this interview,  Henry  (the  younJ  man who  had offered  her  tea) had
advanced her a few hard ucus, which she had used to compile a reasonably
decent full-lenJth dress, hat, Jloves, and reticule. She had Jone in nervous
and reali]ed within  a few minutes that the decision to hire her had already
been made, somehow, and that this  little  Jet-toJether was actually  more
alonJ the lines of an orientation session.

       “Why  is  the Victorian market important  to us?” Madame PinJ asked,
and fixed Nell with an incisive Jlare.

       “Because New Atlantis is one of the three first-tier phyles.”

420
       “Not   correct.  The  wealth  of   New  Atlantis   is  Jreat,  yes.  But   its
population is Must a few percent. The successful New Atlantis man is busy
and has Must a bit of time for scripted fantasies. He has much money, you
understand, but little opportunity  to spend it. No,  this market is  important
because everyone else—the men of all   other phyles, includinJ   many of
Nippon—want to  be like  Victorian  Jentlemen. Look at  the Ashantis—the
-ews—the Coastal Republic. Do they wear traditional costume? Sometimes.
8sually  thouJh, they  wear a suit  on the Victorian  pattern. They  carry an
umbrella from  Old  Bond  Street. They have  a book  of  Sherlock Holmes
stories. They play in Victorian  ractives, and when they have to spend their
natural urJes, they come to me, and , provide them with a scripted fantasy
that was oriJinally reTuested by some Jentleman who came sneakinJ across
the Causeway from New Atlantis.” Somewhat uncharacteristically, Madame
PinJ turned two of her claws into walkinJ leJs and made them scurry across
the tabletop, like a furtive  Vicky  Jent tryinJ  to slip  into ShanJhai without
beinJ cauJht on a  monitor. RecoJni]inJ  her cue, Nell  covered her mouth
with one Jloved hand and tittered.

       “This  way, Madame PinJ does a maJic trick—she  turns one satisfied
client from New Atlantis into a thousand clients from all tribes.”

       “,  must confess that , am surprised,” Nell ventured. “,nexperienced as
,  am in   these matters, ,  had  supposed that each tribe  would  exhibit   a
different preference.”

       “We  chanJe  the script  a  little,”   Madame  PinJ  said, “to   allow  for
cultural differences. But  the story  never chanJes. There are many people
and many tribes, but only so many stories.”


                      Peculiar practices in the woods; the Reformed
                 Distributed Republic;  an extraordinary conversation 
                   in  a log cabin; CryptNet;  the Hackworths depart. 



Half a day's slow eastward ride took them well  up into  the foothills of  the
Cascades, where the clouds, flowinJ  in  eternally  from  the Pacific,  were

421
forced upward by the swellinJ  terrain and unburdened themselves of their
immense stores of moisture. The trees were Jiants, risinJ branchless to far
above their  heads, the  trunks  aJlow  with   moss. The  landscape was  a
checkerboard of old-Jrowth  forest alternatinJ  with  patches that had been
loJJed in the previous century; Hackworth tried to Juide Kidnapper toward
the latter, because the scarcity of  underJrowth  and deadfalls made for  a
smoother ride. They passed throuJh the remains of  an abandoned timber
town,  half  small  clapboard  buildinJs  and  half  moss-covered and  rust-
streaked mobile homes. ThrouJh  their  dirty   windows, faded  siJns were
dimly  visible,  stenciled  TH,S  HO8SEHOLD    DEPENDS  ON  T,MBER
MONEY. Ten-foot saplinJs Jrew  up throuJh cracks in  the streets. Narrow
hedJes of blueberry  shrubs and blackberry canes sprouted from  the rain
Jutters of houses, and JiJantic old cars, restinJ askew on flat  and cracked
tires, had become trellises for morninJ Jlories and vine  maples. They also
passed throuJh an old mininJ encampment that had been abandoned even
lonJer aJo. For the most part, the siJns of modern habitation were relatively
subtle. The  houses up here tended to  be  of  the same unassuminJ style
favored by the software khans closer to Seattle, and from place to place a
number of  them would  cluster  around a central  sTuare with  playJround
eTuipment, café, stores, and other amenities. He and Fiona stopped at two
such places to exchanJe ucus for coffee, sandwiches, and cinnamon rolls.

       The  unmarked,  decussatinJ  paths would   have  been confusinJ   to
anyone but a native. Hackworth had never been here before. He had Jotten
the  coordinates from   the  second fortune  cookie  in   Kidnapper's  Jlove
compartment, which was much less cryptic than the first had been. He had
no way  to tell  whether  he was really  JoinJ  anywhere. His  faith  did  not
beJin to waver until  eveninJ approached, the eternal clouds chanJed from
silver to dark Jray, and he noticed that the chevaline was takinJ them hiJher
and toward less densely populated Jround.

       Then he saw the rocks and knew he had chosen the riJht path. A wall
of brown  Jranite,  dark and damp  from  the condensinJ foJ,  materiali]ed
before them. They heard it  before they  saw it;  it  made no sound, but  its
presence chanJed the acoustics of the forest. The foJ was closinJ in,  and

422
they could  barely see the silhouettes of  scrubby, wind-Jnarled  mountain
trees lined up uncomfortably alonJ the top of the cliff.

       Amid  those trees was the silhouette of a human beinJ.

       “4uiet,”   Hackworth mouthed to his dauJhter, then reined Kidnapper to
a stop.

       The person had a short  haircut and wore a bulky  waist-lenJth  Macket
with stretch  pants; they could  tell  by the  curve of  the hips that  it  was a
woman. Around those hips she had fastened an arranJement of neon Jreen
straps: a  climbinJ   harness. She  wore  no  other  outdoor  paraphernalia,
thouJh, no knapsack or helmet, and behind her on  the clifftop  they could
Must make out the silhouette of a horse, proddinJ the Jround with its nose.
From time to time she checked her wristwatch.

       A  tenuous neon strand of rope hunJ down the bulJinJ face of the cliff
from where the woman stood. The last several meters danJled loosely in the
mist in front of a small co]y pocket sheltered by the overhanJ.

       Hackworth   turned  around  to   Jet  Fiona's   attention,  then  pointed
somethinJ out: a second person, makinJ his way alonJ the base of the cliff,
out  of  siJht   of  the  woman   above. MovinJ   carefully   and  Tuietly,  he
eventually  reached the  shelter  of  the  overhanJ.  He  JinJerly   took  the
danJlinJ end  of the  rope and tied  it  to somethinJ,  apparently a piece of
hardware fixed into  the rock. Then he left  the way  he had come, movinJ
silently and stayinJ close to the cliff.

       The woman remained still and silent for several minutes, checkinJ her
watch more and more freTuently.

       Finally  she backed several paces away from the edJe of the cliff, took
her hands out of her  Macket pockets, seemed to draw a few deep breaths,
then ran forward and launched herself into space. She screamed as she did
it, a scream to drive out her own fear.

423
       The rope ran throuJh  a pulley fixed  near the top of the cliff.   She fell
for a  few  meters, the rope tiJhtened,  the man's knot  held, and the  rope,
which was somewhat elastic, brouJht her to a firm but not violent stop Must
above the wicked pile of rubble and snaJs at the base of the cliff. SwinJinJ
at the end of the rope, she Jrabbed it with one hand and leaned back, barinJ
her throat to the mist, allowinJ herself to danJle listlessly for a few minutes,
baskinJ in relief.

       A  third  person, previously unseen, emerJed from the trees. This one
was a middle-aJed man, and he was wearinJ a Macket that had a few vaJuely
official touches such as an armband and an insiJnia on the breast pocket. He
walked beneath the danJlinJ woman and busied himself for a few moments
beneath the overhanJ, eventually releasinJ the rope and lettinJ her safely to
the Jround. The woman detached herself from the rope and then the harness
and fell into  a businesslike discussion with this  man, who poured both of
them hot drinks from a thermal flask.

       “Have   you   heard   of   these  people?  The   Reformed   Distributed
Republic,” Hackworth said to Fiona, still keepinJ his voice low.

       “,  am only familiar with  the First.”

       “The  First Distributed Republic  doesn't hanJ toJether very well—in a
way, it was never desiJned to. ,t was started by a bunch of people who were
very nearly anarchists. As you've  probably learned in  school, it's become
awfully factionali]ed.”

       “,  have some friends in the F.D.R.,” Fiona said.

       “Your  neiJhbors?”

       “Yes.”

       “Software   khans,”  Hackworth  said.  “The   F.D.R. works   for  them,
because they have somethinJ in  common—old  software money. They're
almost like Victorians—a lot  of them cross over and take the Oath as they

424
Jet older.  But  for  the  broad  middle  class, the  F.D.R. offers  no  central
reliJion or ethnic identity.”

       “So it  becomes balkani]ed.”

       “Precisely.  These people,” Hackworth  said, pointinJ  to the man  and
the woman  at the  base of  the  cliff,   “are  R.D.R., Reformed  Distributed
Republic. Very similar to F.D.R., with one key difference.”

       “The ritual  we Must witnessed?”

       “Ritual   is a  Jood description,”  Hackworth  said. “Earlier   today, that
man and that woman were  both visited  by messenJers who Jave them a
place and time—nothinJ else. ,n this case, the woman's Mob was to Mump off
that cliff  at the  Jiven time.  The man's Mob was to tie the end of  the rope
before she Mumped. A very simple Mob—”

       “But  if he had failed to do it, she'd be dead,” Fiona said.

       “Precisely. The  names are pulled out of  a hat. The  participants have
only a few hours' warninJ.  Here, the ritual is done with  a cliff  and a rope,
because there happened to be a cliff in the vicinity. ,n other R.D.R. nodes,
the mechanism miJht be different. For example, person A miJht  Jo into  a
room, take a pistol out of a box, load it with live ammunition, put it  back in
the box, and then leave the room for ten minutes. DurinJ that time, person
B is  supposed to enter the room and  replace the live  ammunition with  a
dummy clip  havinJ the same weiJht. Then person A  comes back into the
room, puts the Jun to his head, and pulls the triJJer.”

       “But  person A has no way of knowinJ  whether person B has done his
Mob?”

       “Exactly.”

       “What  is the role of the third person?”

425
       “A   proctor.  An  official   of  the R.D.R.  who  sees to  it  that the  two
participants don't try to communicate.”

       “How  freTuently must they underJo this ritual?”

       “As  freTuently as their name comes up at random, perhaps once every
couple  of   years,”   Hackworth   said.  “,t's   a   way   of   creatinJ   mutual
dependency. These people know they can trust each other. ,n a tribe such as
the F.D.R., whose view  of  the universe contains no  absolutes, this ritual
creates an artificial absolute.”

       The woman finished her hot drink,  shook hands with the proctor, then
beJan to ascend a polymer  ladder, fixed  to  the rock,  that took  her back
toward her horse. Hackworth spurred Kidnapper into movement, followinJ
a path that ran parallel to the base of the cliff, and rode for half a kilometer
or so until it  was Moined by another path anJlinJ down from above. A few
minutes later, the woman  approached, ridinJ her  horse, an old-fashioned
bioloJical model.

       She was a healthy, open-faced, apple-cheeked woman, still inviJorated
by her leap into  the unknown,  and she Jreeted them from  some distance
away, without any of the reserve of neo-Victorians.

       “How  do you do,” Hackworth said, removinJ his bowler.

       The woman barely Jlanced at Fiona.  She reined her horse to a Jentle
stop, eyes fixed on Hackworth's face. She was wearinJ a distracted look. “,
know you,” she said. “But , don't know your name.”

       “Hackworth,   -ohn  Percival,  at  your  service.  This  is   my  dauJhter
Fiona.”

       “,'m  sure ,'ve never heard that name,” the woman said.

       “,'m  sure ,'ve never heard yours,” Hackworth said cheerfully.

426
       “MaJJie,”   the woman said. “This is drivinJ  me cra]y. Where have we
met?”

       “This  may sound rather odd,” Hackworth said Jently, “but if you and ,
could both remember all of our dreams—which we can't, of course—and if
we compared notes  lonJ  enouJh, we  would  probably  find  that  we  had
shared a few over the years.”

       “A  lot of people have similar dreams,” MaJJie said.

       “Excuse me, but that's not what , mean,” Hackworth said. “,  refer to a
situation in which each of us would retain his or  her own personal point of
view. ,  would  see you. You  would  see me. We miJht  then share certain
experiences toJether—each of us seeinJ it from our own perspective.”

       “Like  a ractive?”

       “Yes,”  Hackworth  said, “but  you  don't have  to pay  for  it. Not  with
money, anyway.”

         

The local climate lent itself to  hot drinks. MaJJie did  not even take off her
Macket before JoinJ into her kitchen  and puttinJ  a kettle  on to  boil.  The
place was a loJ cabin, airier  than it  looked from  the outside, and MaJJie
apparently shared it with  several other people who  were not  there at the
moment. Fiona, walkinJ  to and from  the bathroom, was fascinated to see
evidence of men and women livinJ and sleepinJ and bathinJ toJether.

       As  they sat around havinJ their tea, Hackworth  persuaded MaJJie to
poke her finJer into  a thimble-si]e  device. When he took this  obMect from
his pocket, Fiona was struck by a powerful sense of déMà vu. She had seen it
before, and it was siJnificant.  She knew that her father had desiJned it; it
bore all the earmarks of his style.

       Then they  all sat around makinJ  small talk for  a few  minutes; Fiona
had many Tuestions about the workinJs of the R.D.R., which MaJJie, a true

427
believer, was pleased to answer. Hackworth  had spread a sheet of blank
paper out on  the table, and  as the minutes  went by,  words and  pictures
beJan to appear on it and to scroll up the paJe after it  had filled  itself  up.
The thimble,  he  explained,  had placed  some reconnaissance mites into
MaJJie's bloodstream, which  had been JatherinJ  information,  flyinJ   out
throuJh her pores when their tape drives were full, and offloadinJ  the data
into the paper.

       “,t  seems that you and , have a mutual acTuaintance, MaJJie,” he said
after a  few  minutes. “We  are  carryinJ  many of  the  same tuples in  our
bloodstreams. They can only be spread throuJh certain forms of contact.”

       “You  mean, like, exchanJe of bodily fluids?” MaJJie said blankly.

       Fiona  thouJht   briefly   of  old-fashioned  transfusions  and  probably
would not have worked out  the real meaninJ of this  phrase had her father
not flushed and Jlanced at her momentarily.

       “,  believe we understand each other, yes,” Hackworth said.

       MaJJie  thouJht about it  for a moment and seemed to Jet irked, or as
irked as someone with her Jenerous and contented nature was ever likely to
Jet. She addressed Hackworth but watched Fiona as she tried to construct
her next sentence. “Despite what you Atlantans miJht  think  of us, ,  don't
sleep .         .          . ,  mean, , don't have s .         .          . , don't have that
many partners.”

       “,   am sorry  to  have Jiven  you  the mistaken  impression that ,  had
formed  any   untoward   preconceptions  about   your   moral   standards,”
Hackworth said. “Please be assured that , do not reJard myself as beinJ in
any position to  MudJe others in this reJard. However, if  you  could  be so
forthcominJ as to tell me who, or with whom, in the last year or so …”

       “-ust  one,” MaJJie  said. “,t's  been a slow year.” Then she set her tea
muJ down  on the table  (Fiona had been startled by  the unavailability  of
saucers) and leaned back in her chair, lookinJ at Hackworth alertly. “Funny
that ,'m tellinJ you this stuff—you, a stranJer.”

428
       “Please allow me to recommend that you trust your instincts and treat
me not as a stranJer.”

       “,  had a flinJ. Months and months aJo. That's been it.”

       “Where?”

       “London.”   A trace of  a smile came onto MaJJie's  face. “You'd think
livinJ  here, ,'d  Jo  someplace warm and sunny. But  ,  went to  London. ,
Juess there's a little Victorian in all of us.

       “,t  was a Juy,” MaJJie  went on. “,  had Jone to London with a couple
of Jirlfriends   of  mine. One of  them  was another R.D.R.  citi]en  and  the
other, Trish, left  the R.D.R. about three years aJo and co-founded a local
CryptNet node. They've Jot a little  point of presence down in Seattle, near
the market.”

       “Please pardon me for interruptinJ,”  Fiona said, “but would you be so
kind as to  explain the nature of  CryptNet? One of  my  old school friends
seems to have Moined it.”

       “A  synthetic phyle. Elusive in the extreme,” Hackworth said.

       “Each  node is  independent and self-JoverninJ,”  MaJJie   said. “You
could  found  a  node  tomorrow  if   you   wanted. Nodes  are  defined  by
contracts. You siJn a contract in which you aJree to provide certain services
when called upon to do so.”

       “What  sorts of services?”

       “Typically,   data is delivered into  your  system. You process the data
and pass it on to other nodes. ,t seemed like a natural to Trish because she
was a coder, like  me and  my housemates and most other people around
here.”

       “Nodes have computers then?”

429
       “The    people   themselves   have   computers,  typically     embedded
systems,” MaJJie said, unconsciously rubbinJ the mastoid bone behind her
ear.

       “,s  the node synonymous with the person, then?”

       “,n  many cases,” MaJJie said, “but sometimes it's several persons with
embedded systems that are contained within the same trust boundary.”

       “May    ,  ask  what   level  your   friend   Trish's  node  has  attained?”
Hackworth said.

       MaJJie  looked uncertain. “EiJht or  nine, maybe. Anyway, we went to
London. While we were there, we decided to take in some shows. , wanted
to see the biJ productions. Those were nice—we saw a nice Doctor Faustus
at the Olivier.”

       “Marlowe's?”

       “Yes. But  Trish had a knack for findinJ  all of  these little, scruffy, out-
of-the-way theatres that , never would have found in a million years—they
weren't marked, and they didn't really  advertise, as far as , could tell.  We
saw some radical stuff—really radical.”

       “,   don't  imaJine you  are usinJ  that  adMective in a political  sense,”
Hackworth said.

       “No,  , mean how they were staJed. ,n one of them, we walked into this
bombed-out old buildinJ in Whitechapel, full  of people millinJ  around, and
all this weird stuff  started happeninJ, and after a while , reali]ed that some
of the people were actors and some were audience and that all of us were
both, in a way. ,t was cool—, suppose you can Jet stuff like that on the net
anytime, in a ractive, but it was so much better to be there with real, warm
bodies around. , felt  happy. Anyway, this  Juy  was JoinJ to  the bar for  a
pint, and he  offered to  Jet me one.  We started talkinJ.  One thinJ  led to
another. He was really intelliJent, really sexy. An African  Juy who knew a
lot about the theatre. This place had back rooms. Some of them had beds.”

430
       “After   you were finished,”  Hackworth  said, “did  you experience any
unusual sensations?”

       MaJJie  threw back her head and lauJhed, thinkinJ that this was a bit
of wry humor on Hackworth's part. But he was serious.

       “After  we were finished?” she said.

       “Yes. Let us say, several minutes afterward.”

       Suddenly MaJJie  became disconcerted. “Yeah, actually,” she said. “,
Jot  hot. Really   hot. We  had  to  leave, 'cause ,  thouJht  ,  had  a  flu  or
somethinJ. We went back to the hotel, and , took my clothes off and stood
out on the balcony. My  temperature was a hundred and four. But the next
morninJ , felt fine. And  ,'ve felt fine ever since.”

       “Thank  you, MaJJie,” Hackworth  said, risinJ to his feet and pocketinJ
the sheet of paper. Fiona rose too, followinJ her father's cue. “Prior to your
London visit, had your social life been an active one?”

       MaJJie  Jot a little pinker. “Relatively active for a few years, yes.”

       “What  sort of crowd? CryptNet  types? People who spent a lot of time
near the water?”

       MaJJie  shook her head. “The water? , don't understand.”

       “Ask   yourself  why  you have  been so inactive,  MaJJie,  since  your
liaison with Mr.—”

       “Beck.  Mr. Beck.”

       “With  Mr.  Beck. Could  it be that  you found the experience Must a bit
alarminJ? ExchanJe of  bodily   fluids  followed  by  a  violent  rise in  core
temperature?”

       MaJJie  was poker-faced.

431
       “,    recommend  that   you   look   into   the   subMect of  spontaneous
combustion,” Hackworth said. And without further  ceremony, he reclaimed
his bowler and umbrella from the entryway and led Fiona back out into the
forest.

       Hackworth  said, “MaJJie  did not tell  you everythinJ about CryptNet.
To beJin with, it is believed to have numerous unsavoury connexions and is
a  perennial   focus  of   Protocol   Enforcement's  investiJations.   And”—
Hackworth lauJhed ruefully—“it   is  patently untrue that ten  is the hiJhest
level.”

       “What  is the Joal of this orJanisation?” Fiona asked.

       “,t  represents itself as a simple, moderately successful data-processinJ
collective. But its actual Joals can only be known by those privileJed to be
included within   the trust  boundary of  the  thirty-third  level,”   Hackworth
said, his voice slowinJ down  as he tried to remember why he knew  all of
these thinJs. “,t is rumoured that, within that select circle, any member can
kill any other simply by thinkinJ  of the deed.”

       Fiona leaned forward and wrapped her arms snuJly around her father's
body, nestled her head between his  shoulder blades, and held  tiJht.  She
thouJht that the subMect of CryptNet was closed; but a Tuarter of an hour
later, as Kidnapper  carried them  swiftly   throuJh the  trees down  toward
Seattle, her father spoke aJain, pickinJ up the sentence where he had left it,
as if he had merely paused for breath. His voice was slow and distant and
almost trancelike,  the memories  percolatinJ  outward from   deep storaJe
with little  participation from  his conscious mind. “CryptNet's true desire is
the Seed—a technoloJy  that,  in   their  diabolical  scheme, will   one  day
supplant the Feed, upon which our  society and many others are founded.
Protocol, to us, has brouJht prosperity and peace—to CryptNet, however, it
is a contemptible system of oppression. They believe that information  has
an almost mystical power of  free flow  and self-replication, as water seeks
its own  level  or  sparks fly   upward—and lackinJ   any moral  code,  they
confuse inevitability  with  RiJht.  ,t  is  their view  that  one day, instead of
Feeds terminatinJ in matter compilers, we will have Seeds that, sown on the

432
earth, will sprout up into  houses, hamburJers, spaceships, and books—that
the Seed will  develop inevitably  from  the Feed, and that upon  it  will  be
founded a more hiJhly evolved society.”

       He  stopped for  a  moment, took  a  deep breath, and seemed to  stir
awake; when he spoke aJain, it  was in  a clearer and stronJer voice.  “Of
course, it  can't  be  allowed—the  Feed is   not  a  system of  control   and
oppression, as CryptNet would maintain.  ,t  is the only  way  order can be
maintained in modern society—if everyone possessed a Seed, anyone could
produce weapons whose  destructive power  rivalled  that  of   Eli]abethan
nuclear weapons. This is why Protocol Enforcement takes such a dim view
of CryptNet's activities.”

       The  trees parted to  reveal a lonJ  blue  lake below  them. Kidnapper
found its  way to  a  road, and Hackworth  spurred it  on  to a  hand-Jallop.
Within  a few hours, father  and dauJhter were settlinJ into  bunkbeds in a
second-class cabin of the airship Falkland Islands, bound for London.

       LyinJ   in  her  bunkbed in   Madame PinJ's  dormitory,  readinJ  these
words from a softly JlowinJ  paJe in the middle of the niJht, Nell wondered
at that. Princesses were not Jenetically different from commoners.

       On the other side of a fairly  thin  wall she could hear water runninJ in
half a do]en sinks as younJ women performed their  crepuscular ablutions.
Nell was the only  scripter stayinJ in Madame PinJ's dormitory;  the others
were performers and were  Must cominJ back from a  lonJ viJorous  shift,
rubbinJ liniment   on their  shoulders, sore from  wieldinJ   paddles aJainst
clients' bottoms, or snortinJ up Jreat nostril-loads of  mites proJrammed to
seek out their  inflamed  buttocks and  help  to repair  damaJed capillaries
overniJht. And  of course, many more traditional  activities were JoinJ  on,
such as douchinJ, makeup removal, moisturi]inJ,   and the  like.  The Jirls
went throuJh these motions briskly, with the unselfconscious efficiency that
the Chinese all  seemed to share, discussinJ  the day's  events in  the dry
ShanJhainese dialect. Nell had been livinJ amonJ these Jirls  for  a month
and was  Must startinJ to pick  up  a  few  words. They  all  spoke  EnJlish
anyway.

       She stayed up late readinJ the Primer in the dark. The dormitory was a
Jood place for this; Madame PinJ's Jirls were professionals, and after a few
minutes of whisperinJ, JiJJlinJ,  and scandali]ed communal shushinJ, they
always went to sleep.

       Nell  sensed that she was cominJ close to the end of the Primer.

435
       This  would  have been evident even if  she hadn't been closinJ in  on
Coyote, the twelfth and final Faery KinJ.  ,n  the last few weeks, since Nell
had entered the domain of  KinJ  Coyote, the character of  the Primer  had
chanJed. Formerly, her NiJht  Friends or  other characters had acted with
minds of  their  own, even if   Nell  Must went alonJ passively. ReadinJ the
Primer had always meant ractinJ  with other  characters in the book while
also havinJ to think her way throuJh various interestinJ situations.

       Recently  the former  element had been almost absent. Castle TurinJ
had been a fair sample of KinJ  Coyote's domain: a place with few  human
beinJs, albeit filled with fascinatinJ places and situations.

       She  made her  lonesome way  across the  domain  of  KinJ   Coyote,
visitinJ one castle after another, and encounterinJ a different conundrum in
each one. The second castle (after Castle TurinJ) was built on the slope of a
mountain and had an  elaborate irriJation  system in  which  water  from  a
bubblinJ sprinJ  was routed throuJh  a system of  Jates. There were many
thousands of these Jates, and they were connected to each other in small
Jroups, so that one Jate's openinJ or closinJ would, in some way, affect that
of the others in its Jroup. This castle Jrew its own food and was sufferinJ a
terrible famine because the arranJement of Jates had in some way become
fubared. A   dark,  mysterious  kniJht   had  come  to  visit   the  place  and
apparently sneaked out of   his bedroom  in  the middle  of   the niJht  and
fiddled with  connections between some Jates in such a way that water no
lonJer flowed to the fields. Then he had disappeared, leavinJ behind a note
statinJ that he would fix the problem in exchanJe for a larJe ransom in Jold
and Mewels.

       Princess Nell  spent some time  studyinJ the  problem and eventually
noticed that the system of Jates was actually a very sophisticated version of
one of   the Duke  of   TurinJ's  machines. Once  she understood  that  the
behavior of  the water-Jates was orderly  and predictable, it  was not  lonJ
before she was able to proJram their behavior and locate the buJs that the
dark  kniJht  had  introduced  into  the  system.  Soon water  was  flowinJ
throuJh the irriJation system aJain, and the famine was relieved.

436
       The  people who  lived   in  this  castle were  Jrateful,  which  she had
expected. But then they put a crown on her head and made her their ruler,
which she had not expected.

       On some reflection, thouJh, it only made sense. They would die unless
their system functioned properly.  Princess Nell was  the only  person who
knew how it worked; she held their fate in her hands. They had little choice
but to submit to her rule.

       So   it   went,  as   Princess Nell    proceeded from   castle  to   castle,
inadvertently findinJ  herself at the helm of a full-fledJed  rebellion  aJainst
KinJ  Coyote.  Each castle  depended on  some kind  of  a  proJrammable
system that was a little more complicated than the previous one. After  the
Castle of the Water-Jates, she came to a castle with a  maJnificent orJan,
powered by air pressure and controlled by a bewilderinJ Jrid of push-rods,
which could play  music stored on a roll  of paper tape with holes punched
throuJh it. A  mysterious dark kniJht  had proJrammed the orJan to play  a
sad, depressinJ tune, plunJinJ the place into a profound depression so that
no one worked or even Jot out of bed. With some playinJ around, Princess
Nell established that the  behavior of  the orJan could  be simulated by an
extremely sophisticated arranJement of water-Jates, which meant, in turn,
that  it   could  Must as well   be  reduced  to  an  unfathomably   lonJ  and
complicated TurinJ machine proJram.

       When she had the orJan  workinJ  properly and the  residents cheered
up, she moved on to a castle that functioned accordinJ to rules written in a
Jreat book, in a peculiar lanJuaJe. Some paJes of the book had been ripped
out by  the mysterious dark  kniJht,  and Princess Nell  had  to reconstruct
them, learninJ the lanJuaJe, which  was extremely pithy  and made heavy
use of  parentheses. AlonJ   the way,  she  proved  what  was  a  foreJone
conclusion, namely,  that  the  system  for  processinJ  this  lanJuaJe  was
essentially a more complex version of the mechanical orJan, hence a TurinJ
machine in essence.

       Next  was a castle divided into  many small  rooms, with a  system for
passinJ messaJes between rooms throuJh a pneumatic tube. ,n each room

437
was a Jroup of people who responded to the messaJes by followinJ certain
rules laid out  in books, which  usually entailed sendinJ more  messaJes to
other rooms. After familiari]inJ   herself with  some of these rule-books and
establishinJ that the castle was another TurinJ machine, Princess Nell fixed
a problem  in  the messaJe-delivery system that had  been created by the
vexatious dark kniJht,  collected another ducal  coronet, and moved on  to
castle number six.

       This  place was entirely  different.  ,t  was much  biJJer.  ,t  was much
richer. And unlike all  of the other castles in the domain of KinJ  Coyote, it
worked. As she approached the castle, she learned to keep her horse to the
edJe of the road, for messenJers were constantly blowinJ past her at a full
Jallop in both directions.

       ,t  was a  vast open marketplace with  thousands of stalls,  filled  with
carts and runners carryinJ product in all directions. But no veJetables, fish,
spices, or fodder  were to  be seen here; all  the  product was  information
written down  in  books. The books were  trundled from  place to  place on
wheelbarrows and  carried  here and  there  on  Jreat  lonJ  seedy-lookinJ
conveyor belts made of hemp and burlap. Book-carriers bumped into each
other, compared notes as to what they were carryinJ and where they were
JoinJ, and swapped books for  other books. Stacks of books were  sold in
Jreat, raucous auctions—and paid for not with  Jold but  with other  books.
Around the edJes of the  market were stalls where books were exchanJed
for Jold, and beyond that, a few alleys where Jold  could be exchanJed for
food.

       ,n  the midst of this hubbub, Princess Nell saw a dark kniJht sittinJ on
a black horse, paJinJ throuJh one of these books. Without further ado, she
spurred her horse forward  and drew  her  sword. She slew  him  in  sinJle
combat, riJht there in  the middle of  the marketplace, and the book-sellers
simply backed out of their  way and iJnored them as Princess Nell and the
dark kniJht  hacked and slashed at each other. When the dark  kniJht  fell
dead and Princess Nell sheathed her sword, the commotion closed in about
her aJain, like the waters of a turbulent river closinJ over a fallinJ stone.

438
       Nell  picked  up the  book that  the dark kniJht  had  been readinJ and
found that it contained nothinJ but Jibberish. ,t was written in some kind of
a cipher.

       She  spent some time  reconnoiterinJ,  lookinJ  for   the center  of  the
place, and found no center. One stall was the same as the next. There was
no tower, no throne room, no clear system of authority.

       ExamininJ  the  market stalls  in  more detail,  she saw  that each one
included a  man who  did  nothinJ  but sit  at  a table  and decipher books,
writinJ them out on lonJ sheets of foolscap and handinJ them over to other
people, who  would  read  throuJh  the  contents, consult  rule-books,  and
dictate responses to the man with the Tuill pen, who enciphered them and
wrote them out in books that were then tossed out into the marketplace for
delivery. The men  with  the Tuill  pens, she noticed, always wore  Meweled
keys on chains around their necks; the key was apparently the badJe of the
cipherers' Juild.

       This  castle proved fiendishly difficult   to fiJure  out,  and Nell spent a
few weeks workinJ  on  it.  Part of the  problem was that this  was the first
castle Princess Nell had visited that was actually  functioninJ  as intended;
the dark kniJht  had not been able to  foul  the place up, probably  because
everythinJ was done in ciphers here, and everythinJ was decentrali]ed. Nell
discovered that a smoothly functioninJ system was much harder to pu]]le
out than one that was broken.

       ,n  the end, Princess Nell had to apprentice herself to a master cipherer
and learn everythinJ  there  was to  know  about codes and  the keys  that
unlocked them. This done, she was Jiven her own  key, as a badJe of her
office, and  found a  Mob in one of the  stalls encipherinJ  and decipherinJ
books. As it turned out, the key was more than Must a decoration; rolled up
inside its shaft was a strip of parchment inscribed with a lonJ  number that
could be used to decipher a messaJe, if the sender wanted you to decipher
it.

439
       From time to  time she would Jo to the edJe of the market, exchanJe a
book for some Jold, then Jo buy some food and drink.

       On one of these trips, she saw another member of the cipherer's Juild,
also takinJ  his break, and  noticed that the  key hanJinJ  around his  neck
looked familiar:   it  was one  of  the eleven keys  that Nell   and her NiJht
Friends had taken from  the Faery KinJs  and 4ueens!  She concealed her
excitement and followed this  cipherer back to  his stall,  makinJ a  note of
where he worked. Over  the next  few  days, JoinJ  from  stall  to stall  and
examininJ each cipherer, she was able to locate the rest of the eleven keys.

       She was able to steal a look at the rule-books that her employers used
to respond to the encoded messaJes. They were written in the same special
lanJuaJe used at the previous two castles.

       ,n  other words, once Princess Nell had deciphered the messaJes, her
stall functioned like another TurinJ machine.

       ,t  would have been easy enouJh to conclude that this whole castle was,
like the others, a TurinJ machine. But the Primer had tauJht Nell to be very
careful  about makinJ   unwarranted assumptions. -ust   because her stall
functioned accordinJ to TurinJ rules did not mean that all of the others did.
And even if every stall in this castle was, in fact, a TurinJ machine, she still
could not  come to  any  fixed  conclusions. She had  seen riders carryinJ
books to and from the castle, which meant that cipherers must be at work
elsewhere in this  kinJdom.  She  could not  verify   that all  of   them were
TurinJ machines.

       ,t  did  not  take lonJ  for  Nell   to attain  prosperity here.  After  a few
months (which in  the Primer were summari]ed  in as many sentences) her
employers announced that they were JettinJ  more  work  than they  could
handle. They decided to split their operation. They erected a new stall at the
edJe of the market and Jave Nell some of their rule-books.

       They also obtained a new key for her. This was done by dispatchinJ a
special coded messaJe to the Castle of KinJ   Coyote himself,  which  was

440
three days' ride to the north. Seven days later, Nell's key came back to her in
a scarlet box bearinJ the seal of KinJ Coyote himself.

       From time  to time, someone would come around to her stall and offer
to buy her out. She always turned them down but  found it  interestinJ that
the keys could be bouJht and sold in this fashion.

       All   Nell needed was money, which she Tuickly  accumulated throuJh
shrewd dealinJs in the market. Before lonJ, all  eleven of the keys were in
her possession, and after liTuidatinJ  her  holdinJs  and turninJ  them into
Mewels, which she sewed into her clothes, she rode her horse out of the sixth
castle and turned north, headinJ for the seventh: the Castle of KinJ Coyote,
and the ultimate Joal of her lifelonJ Tuest.


                 Nell  goes to Madame Ping's Theatre; rumors of the
                    Fists; an important  client;  assault of the Fists of 
                     Righteous Harmony;  ruminations  on the inner 
                                          workings of ractives. 



Like much that was done with nanotechnoloJy, Feed lines were assembled
primarily from a few species of small and uncomplicated atoms in the upper
riJht-hand corner of  Mendeleev's Jrid:  carbon, nitroJen,  oxyJen,  silicon,
phosphorus, sulfur, and  chlorine.  The  Fists of  RiJhteous  Harmony  had
discovered, to  their  endurinJ deliJht,   that obMects made of these atoms
burned rather nicely once you Jot them JoinJ. The flat,  low YanJt]e  Delta
country east of  ShanJhai was a  silk  district  well  stocked with  mulberry
trees, which when felled, stacked, and burned beneath the Feed lines would
eventually iJnite them like road flares.

       The Nipponese Feed was heavy on the phosphorus and burned with a
furious white flame that lit  up the niJht  sky in  several places as seen from
the tall buildinJs in PudonJ. One maMor line led toward NanMinJ, one toward
Su]hou, one toward HanJ]hou: these distant flares inevitably led to rumors,
amonJ the hordes of refuJees in ShanJhai, that those cities were themselves
burninJ.

441
       The New Atlantan Feed had a hiJher sulfur content that, when burned,
produced a plutonic  reek that  permeated everythinJ for  do]ens  of  miles
downwind,  makinJ  the  fires  seem much  closer  than  they  really  were.
ShanJhai was smellinJ pretty sulfurous as Nell walked into it across one of
the bridJes linkinJ downtown PudonJ with the much lower and older Bund.
The HuanJ Pu  had been too  wide to  bridJe  easily until  nano  had come
alonJ, so the four downtown  bridJes were made of the new materials and
seemed  impossibly    fraJile    compared   with    the   reinforced-concrete
behemoths built to the north and south durinJ the previous century.

       A  few  days aJo,  workinJ  on  a script  in  Madame PinJ's offices  far
above, Nell had Ja]ed out the window at a barJe makinJ its way  down the
river,  pulled by  a  rickety  old   diesel tuJ,  swathed in  dun  tarps.  A  few
hundred meters upstream of this  very  bridJe  she was now  crossinJ, the
tarps had beJun sTuirminJ and boilinJ,  and a  do]en younJ  men in  white
tunics had Mumped out from beneath, scarlet bands tied about their waists,
scarlet ribbons around their wrists and foreheads. They had swarmed across
the top  of   the barJe  hackinJ  at  ropes with   knives,  and the  tarps  had
reluctantly and unevenly fallen  away to  expose a patchy new coat of  red
paint and,  lined  up  on the  top  of  the  barJe like   a strinJ  of  enormous
firecrackers, several do]en compressed Jas tanks, also painted a festive red
for the occasion. 8nder the circumstances, she did not doubt for a moment
that the men were Fists and the Jas hydroJen or somethinJ else that burned
well. But before they had been able to reach the bridJe, the tanks had been
burst and iJnited by somethinJ too small  and fast for Nell  to see from her
hiJh post. The barJe silently  turned into  a carbuncle of yellow  flame that
took up half  the width of  the HuanJ Pu, and thouJh the diamond window
filtered all of  the heat out of its radiance, Nell was able to put her hand on
the pane and feel  the absorbed warmth, not  much hotter than  a person's
skin. The whole operation had been touchinJly  hapless, in an aJe when a
hand-si]e battery could  contain as much  enerJy as all  those cylinders of
Jas. ,t had a Tuaint twentieth-century feel and made Nell oddly nostalJic for
the days  when  danJerousness was a  function  of   mass and  bulk.  The
passives of that era were so fun to watch, with their biJ, stupid cars and biJ,
stupid Juns and biJ, stupid people.

442
       8p-   and downstream of  the bridJe,  the funeral  piers were  crowded
with refuJee  families  heavinJ corpses into  the HuanJ  Pu; the emaciated
bodies, rolled  up   in  white  sheets, looked  like   ciJarettes.  The  Coastal
Republic authorities had instituted a pass system on the bridJes to prevent
rural refuJees from  swarminJ  across into  the relatively  spacious streets,
pla]as, atria,  and lobbies of  PudonJ and  JumminJ  up the  works for  the
office crowd. By the time Nell made it across, a couple of hundred refuJees
had already picked her out as a likely  alms source and were waitinJ  with
canned demonstrations: women holdinJ   up their  Jaunt  babies, or  older
children who were trained to hanJ comatose in their arms; men with  open
wounds,  and  leJless  Jaffers  dauntlessly  knuckle-walkinJ   throuJh   the
crowd, buttinJ  at people's knees. The taxi-drivers were stronJer and more
aJJressive than the  rurals,  thouJh,  and had  a  fearsome reputation  that
created space around them in the crowd, and that was more valuable than an
actual vehicle; a vehicle would always Jet stuck in traffic, but a taxi-driver's
hat Jenerated a maJic force field that enabled the wearer to walk faster than
anyone else.

       The taxi-drivers converJed on Nell too, and she picked out the biJJest
one and haJJled with him, holdinJ  up finJers and essayinJ a few words in
ShanJhainese. When the numbers had climbed into the riJht ranJe for him,
he spun  around  suddenly  to  face  the  crowd.   The  suddenness of  the
movement drove people back, and the meter-lonJ bamboo stick in his hand
didn't hurt either. He stepped forward and Nell  hurried after him,  iJnorinJ
the myriad tuJJinJs  at her lonJ  skirts, tryinJ  not  to wonder  which of  the
beJJars was a Fist with a concealed knife. ,f her clothes hadn't been made
of untearable, uncuttable nanostuff, she would  have been stripped  naked
within a block.

       Madame PinJ's  was still  doinJ  a decent business. ,ts clientele  were
willinJ  to put up with  some inconvenience to Jet there. ,t was only a short
distance from the bridJehead, and the Madame had put a few truculent taxi-
drivers on retainer as personal escorts. The business was startlinJly  larJe
Jiven the scarcity of real estate in ShanJhai; it occupied most of a five-story
reinforced-concrete Mao Dynasty apartment block, havinJ started out with
Must a couple of flats and expanded room by room as the years went on.

443
       The reception area reminded one of a not-bad hotel lobby, except that
it had no restaurant or bar; none of the clients wanted to see or be seen by
any other. The desk was staffed  by concierJes whose Mob was to Jet the
clients out of  view as Tuickly  as possible, and they did  it so  well that  an
uninitiated passerby miJht Jet the impression that Madame PinJ's was some
kind of a walk-in kidnappinJ operation.

       One of these functionaries, a tiny woman who seemed oddly prim and
asexual considerinJ that she was wearinJ a black leather miniskirt, briskly
took Nell  to the  top floor,  where the larJe apartments had been built and
elaborate scenarios were now reali]ed for Madame PinJ's clients.

       As  the writer, Nell  of course never actually entered the same room as
the  client.  The   woman  in   the  miniskirt    escorted her   into  a   nearby
observation room, where a hiJh-res cine feed from the next  room covered
most of one wall.

       ,f  she hadn't known it already, Nell would  have seen from the client's
uniform  that  he was  a  colonel  in  Her  MaMesty's -oint Forces. He  was
wearinJ a full  dress uniform, and the various pins and medals on his  coat
indicated that he had spent a  Jood deal of  his career attached to various
Protocol Enforcement  units, been wounded  in  action several  times, and
displayed exceptional heroism on one occasion. ,n fact, it was clear that he
was a rather important fellow. ReviewinJ  the previous half-hour, Nell  saw
that, not surprisinJly,  he had  arrived in  mufti,  carryinJ  the uniform   in a
leather satchel. WearinJ the uniform must be part of the scenario.

       At   the moment  he was  seated in  a rather  typical  Victorian  parlor,
sippinJ tea  from  a Royal  Albert   china cup  decorated with  a  somewhat
aJonistic briar rose pattern. He looked fidJety;  he'd been kept waitinJ  for
half an hour, which was also part of the scenario. Madame PinJ kept tellinJ
her that  no one  ever complained  about havinJ  to  wait  too  lonJ  for  an
orJasm; that men could do  that to themselves any time  they wanted, and
that it  was  the  business leadinJ up  to  it  that  they  would  pay for.  The
bioloJical  readouts seemed to confirm  Madame PinJ's  rule:  Perspiration
and pulse were rather hiJh, and he was about half erect.

444
       Nell  heard the sound of a door openinJ. SwitchinJ to a different anJle
she saw a parlormaid enterinJ the  room. Her  uniform was  not as overtly
sexy as most of the ones in Madame PinJ's wardrobe department; the client
was sophisticated. The woman was Chinese, but she played the role with
the mid-Atlantic   accent currently in  voJue  amonJ neo-Victorians:  “Mrs.
Braithwaite will  see you now.”

       The client stepped into an adMoininJ drawinJ room, where two women
awaited him:  a  heavy  AnJlo   in  late  middle  aJe  and a  very  attractive
Eurasian woman,  about  thirty.  ,ntroductions   were  performed:  The  old
woman was Mrs. Braithwaite,  and the younJer woman  was her dauJhter.
Mrs. was somewhat addled, and Miss was obviously runninJ the show.

       This  section of the script never chanJed, and Nell  had been over it a
hundred times tryinJ   to troubleshoot  it.  The client  went  throuJh a  little
speech in which  he informed  Mrs.  Braithwaite that  her son Richard  had
been killed in  action, displayinJ  Jreat heroism in the process, and that he
was recommendinJ him for a posthumous Victoria Cross.

       Nell   had already  done the  obvious, JoinJ   back throuJh  the  Times
archives to see whether this was a reconstruction of an actual event in the
client's life. As far  as she could determine, it was more like a composite of
many similar events, perhaps with a dollop of fantasy thrown in.

       At  this point, the old lady Jot a case of the vapors and had to be helped
from the room by the parlormaid and other servants, leavinJ the client alone
with  Miss  Braithwaite,  who  was takinJ  the  whole  thinJ  Tuite stoically.
“Your  composure is  admirable, Miss  Braithwaite,”   said the  client,  “but
please be assured that no  one  will   blame you  for  JivinJ   vent  to  your
emotions at such a  time.”  When the client  spoke this  line,  there was an
audible tremor of excitement in his voice.

       “Very  well,  then,” said Miss Braithwaite.  She withdrew a small black
box from her reticule  and pressed a button. The client Jrunted and arched
his back so violently that he fell out of  his chair onto the ruJ, where he lay
paraly]ed.

445
       “Mites—you  have infected my body with some insidious nanosite,” he
Jasped.

       “,n  the tea.”

       “But   that  is  impossible—most mites  hiJhly   susceptible to  thermal
damaJe—boilinJ water would destroy them.”

       “You  underestimate the capabilities of CryptNet, Colonel Napier. Our
technoloJy is advanced far beyond your knowledJe—as you will  discover
durinJ the next few days!”

       “Whatever your plan is—be assured that it will fail!”

       “Oh,  , have no plan in particular,” Miss Braithwaite said. “This is not a
CryptNet operation. This is  personal. You are responsible for the death of
my brother Richard—and , will have you show the proper contrition.”

       “,  assure you that , was as deeply saddened—”

       She ]apped him aJain. “,  do not want your sadness,” she said. “, want
you to admit the truth: that you are responsible for his death!”

       She pressed another button, which caused Colonel Napier's body to Jo
limp. She and a maid wrestled him into a dumbwaiter and moved him down
to a lower floor, where, after descendinJ via the stairway, they tied him to a
rack.

       This  was where the problem came in.  By the  time they had finished
tyinJ him up, he was sound asleep.

       “He   did   it   aJain,”   said   the  woman   playinJ   the  role   of   Miss
Braithwaite,  addressinJ herself to  Nell   and anyone  else who  miJht   be
monitorinJ. “Six  weeks in a row now.”

       When   Madame  PinJ   had  explained  this   problem  to   Nell,   Nell
wondered what the problem  was. Let  the man  sleep, as lonJ as  he kept

446
cominJ and paid his bill. But Madame PinJ knew her clients and feared that
Colonel Napier  was losinJ  interest and miJht  shift  his  business to some
other establishment unless they put some variety into the scenario.

       “The  fiJhtinJ   has been very  bad,”  the actress said.  “He's probably
exhausted.”

       “,  don't think  it's that,” Nell  said. She had now opened a private voice
channel direct to the woman's eardrum. “, think it is a personal chanJe.”

       “They  never chanJe, sweetheart,” said the actress. “Once they Jet the
taste, they have it forever.”

       “Yes,  but different  situations  may triJJer  those feelinJs  at  different
times of life,”  Nell said. “,n  the past it has been Juilt over the deaths of his
soldiers. Now he has made his peace. He has accepted his Juilt, and so he
accepts the punishment. There is no lonJer a contest of  wills,  because he
has become submissive.”

       “So what do we do?”

       “We  must create a Jenuine contest of wills. We must force him  to do
somethinJ he really  doesn't want to do,”  Nell  said, thinkinJ  aloud.  What
would fit that bill?

       “Wake  him up,”  Nell  said. “Tell  him  you  were lyinJ  when you  said
this wasn't a CryptNet operation. Tell him  you want real  information. You
want military secrets.”

       Miss  Braithwaite  sent the maid  out  for  a bucket of  cold  water  and
heaved it over Colonel Napier's body. Then she played the role as Nell had
suJJested, and did it well;  Madame PinJ  hired people who  were Jood at
improvisation, and since most of them never actually had to have sex with
clients, she had no trouble findinJ Jood ones.

       Colonel  Napier  seemed surprised, not unpleasantly so, at  the script
chanJe. “,f  you suppose that , will  divulJe  information  that miJht  lead to

447
the deaths of more of my soldiers, you are sadly mistaken,” he said. But his
voice sounded a little bored and disappointed, and the bio readouts cominJ
in from  the  nanosites in his  body  did not  show  the full   flush of  sexual
excitement that, presumably, he was payinJ for. They still were not meetinJ
their client's needs.

       On the private channel to Miss Braithwaite, Nell said, “He still  doesn't
Jet it. This isn't a fantasy scenario anymore. This is real. Madame PinJ's is
actually a  CryptNet  operation.  We've been drawinJ  him  in  for   the last
several years. Now he belonJs to us, and he's JoinJ to Jive us information,
and he's JoinJ to keep JivinJ it to us, because he's our slave.”

       Miss Braithwaite  acted the scene as suJJested, makinJ up more florid
dialoJue as she went alonJ. WatchinJ the bio readouts, Nell could see that
Colonel Napier was Must as scared and excited, now, as he had been on his
very first visit to Madame PinJ's several years aJo (they kept records). They
were makinJ him feel younJ aJain, and fully alive.

       “Are  you connected with Dr. ;?”  Colonel Napier said.

       “We'll  ask the Tuestions,” Nell said.

       “,   shall do  the askinJ.  Lotus, Jive  him  twenty  for  that!”  said Miss
Braithwaite, and the maid went to work on Colonel Napier with a cane.

       The  rest of  the session almost ran  itself,  which  was Jood for  Nell,
because she had been startled by Napier's reference to Dr. ; and had Jone
into a reverie, rememberinJ comments that Harv had made about the same
person many years aJo.

       Miss   Braithwaite   knew   her  Mob and   understood  Nell's  strateJy
instantly: the scenario did not excite  the client unless there was a Jenuine
contest of wills,  and the only  way  for  them to create that  contest was to
force Napier to  reveal real classified information.  Reveal it he did,  bit  by
bit, under  the encouraJement of  Lotus's bamboo and  Miss Braithwaite's
voice. Most of it had to do with troop movements and other minutiae that he
probably thouJht was terribly interestinJ. Nell didn't.

448
       “Get  more about Dr. ;,”    she said. “Why did  he assume a connection
between CryptNet and Dr. ;?”

       After  a few more minutes of whackinJ and verbal domination, Colonel
Napier was ready to spill. “BiJ  operation of ours for many years now—Dr.
;  is workinJ  in collusion  with a hiJh-level  CryptNet fiJure, the Alchemist.
WorkinJ on somethinJ they mustn't be allowed to have.”

       “Don't  you dare hold back on me,” Miss Braithwaite said.

       But  before she could  extract more information  about the Alchemist,
the buildinJ  was Molted by a tremendous force that sent thin cracks racinJ
throuJh the  old  concrete. ,n  the  silence that  followed,  Nell   could  hear
women screaminJ all over the buildinJ,  and a cracklinJ,  hissinJ sound as
dust and sand sifted out of a fissure in the ceilinJ.  Then her ears beJan to
resolve another sound: men shoutinJ, “Sha! Sha!”

       “,   suJJest that someone has Must breached the wall of your buildinJ
with  an explosive  charJe,” Colonel  Napier  said, perfectly  calm. “,f   you
would be so Jood as to terminate the scenario now and release me, , shall
try to make myself useful in whatever is to follow.”

       Whatever is  to follow.  The shoutinJ  meant simply, “Kill!    Kill!”    and
was the battle cry of the Fists of RiJhteous Harmony.

       Perhaps they wanted Colonel Napier. But it was more likely  that they
had decided to attack this place for its symbolic value as a den of barbarian
decadence.

       Miss  Braithwaite and Lotus had already Jotten Colonel Napier out  of
his restraints, and he was pullinJ on his trousers. “That we are not all dead
implies that  they are not  makinJ  use of  nanotechnoloJical methods,” he
said professorially. “Hence this attack may safely be  assumed to oriJinate
from a low-level neiJhborhood cell. The attackers probably believe the Fist
doctrine that they  are immune from  all  weapons. ,t never  hurts, in  these
situations, to Jive them a reality check of some sort.”

449
       The door  to Napier's room flew  open, splinters of blond  naked wood
hissinJ across the floor. Nell watched, as thouJh watchinJ an old movie, as
Colonel Napier drew  a ridiculously  shiny cavalry  saber from its scabbard
and ran it  throuJh the chest of  the attackinJ Fist.  This one fell  back  into
another, creatinJ  momentary  confusion;   Napier  took   advantaJe of   it,
methodically plantinJ his feet in a rather prissy-lookinJ stance, sTuarinJ his
shoulders, calmly reachinJ out, as if he were usinJ the saber to poke around
in a  dark closet,  and twitchinJ  the  point  beneath the second Fist's chin,
incidentally cuttinJ his throat in the process. A third Fist had Jotten into the
room by this point,  this one bearinJ a lonJ pole with  a knife  lashed to the
end of it  with  the Jray polymer  ribbon  peasants used for rope. But as he
tried to wheel the weapon around, its butt end Jot tanJled up in the rack to
which  Napier  had lately   been tied.  Napier  stepped forward  cautiously,
checkinJ his footinJ  as he went, as if he did not want to  Jet any blood on
his boots, parried a belated attack, and stabbed the Fist in the thorax three
times in Tuick succession.

       Someone kicked at the door to Nell's room.

       “Ah,”   Colonel Napier siJhed, when it seemed clear that there were no
more attackers in this party, “it is really very sinJular  that , happen to have
brouJht the full dress uniform, as edJed weapons are not a part of our usual
kit.”

       Several kicks had failed to  open Nell's door, which unlike  the ones in
the scenario rooms was made of a modern substance and could not possibly
be broken in that way. But  Nell  could hear voices out in  the corridor  and
suspected that contrary to Napier's speculation, they miJht have nanotech
devices of a very primitive sort—small explosives, say, capable of blowinJ
doors open.

       She ditched her lonJ dress, which would  only Jet in  the way, and Jot
down on knees and elbows to peer throuJh the crack under the door. There
were two pairs of feet. She could hear them conversinJ in low, businesslike
tones.

450
       Nell  opened the door suddenly with one hand, reachinJ throuJh with
the other to shove a fountain pen into the throat of the Fist standinJ closest
to the door. The other one reached for an old automatic rifle slunJ over his
shoulder. This Jave Nell  more than enouJh time to  kick  him in  the knee,
which may or  may not  have done permanent damaJe but certainly threw
him off   balance. The Fist  kept tryinJ   to brinJ   his rifle   to bear, as Nell
kicked him over  and over aJain. ,n the end she was able to twist  the rifle
free from his feeble one-handed Jrasp, whirl it around, and butt him in  the
head.

       The Fist with  the pen in his neck was sittinJ on the floor watchinJ her
calmly. She aimed the rifle  his way, and he held  up one hand and looked
down and away. His wound  was bleedinJ, but not  all that  much; she had
ruined his week but not hit anythinJ biJ.  She reflected that it was probably
a healthy thinJ for  him in  the lonJ run to  be rid of the superstition that he
was immune to weapons.

       Constable Moore   had tauJht  her  a thinJ   or  two  about  rifles.  She
stepped back into her room, locked the door, and devoted a minute or so to
familiari]inJ   herself  with  its  controls, checkinJ  the maJa]ine  (only  half
full) and firinJ  a sinJle round (into the door, which stopped it) Must to make
sure it worked.

       She was  tryinJ  to  suppress a flashback to the  screwdriver incident.
This friJhtened her  until she reali]ed  that this  time around she was much
more in control of  the situation. Her conversations with the Constable had
not been without effect.

       Then she made her way down the corridors and stairwells toward  the
lobby, slowly JatherinJ a retinue of  terrified  younJ women alonJ her way.
They passed a few clients, mostly male and mostly European, who had been
pulled from their scenario rooms and crudely hacked up by the Fists. Three
times she  had to  fire,  surprised  each time  at  how  complicated it   was.
Accustomed to the Primer, Nell had to make allowances when functioninJ
in the real world.

451
       She and her followers found Colonel Napier in  the lobby, about three-
Tuarters dressed, carryinJ on  a  memorable edJed-weapons duel  with  a
couple of Fists who had, perhaps, been left there to keep the path of escape
open. Nell  considered tryinJ  to shoot at  the Fists but  decided aJainst it,
because she did not  trust  her  marksmanship and also  because she was
mesmeri]ed by the entire scene.

       Nell   would  have  been da]]led   by  Colonel  Napier  if   she had  not
recently seen him strapped to a rack. Still, there was somethinJ about this
very contradiction  that  made him,  and  by  extension all  Victorian   men,
fascinatinJ to her. They lived  a life  of  nearly perfect emotional  denial—a
form of  asceticism as extreme as that of  a medieval stylite.  Yet they  did
have emotions, the same as anyone else, and only vented them in carefully
selected circumstances.

       Napier calmly  impaled a Fist who  had tripped and fallen, then turned
his attention to a new antaJonist, a formidable character skilled with a real
sword. The duel between Western and Eastern martial arts moved back and
forth across the lobby  floor,  the two  combatants starinJ directly into  one
another's eyes and tryinJ to intuit the other's thouJhts and emotional state.
The actual thrusts and parries and ripostes, when they came, were too rapid
to be understood. The Fist's style  was Tuite beautiful to  watch, involvinJ
many slow movements that looked like the stretchinJ of larJe felines at the
]oo.  Napier's  style was  almost  perfectly  borinJ:  He  moved  about in  a
crabbed stance, watched his opponent calmly, and apparently did a lot  of
deep thinkinJ.

       WatchinJ Napier at work, watchinJ the medals and braid swinJinJ and
JlintinJ  on  his Macket, Nell reali]ed that  it  was precisely their  emotional
repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in
the world. Their  ability  to  submerJe their feelinJs, far  from  patholoJical,
was rather a kind of mystical art that Jave them nearly maJical power over
Nature and over the more intuitive tribes. Such was also the strenJth of the
Nipponese.

452
       Before the struJJle could  be resolved, a smart flechette, horsefly-si]e,
trailinJ a whip  antenna as thick as a hair and as lonJ as a finJer, hissed in
throuJh a broken window and thunked into the back of the Fist's neck. ,t did
not strike very hard but must have shot some poison into his brain. He sat
down Tuickly on the floor, closed his eyes, and died in that position.

       “Not  very  chivalrous,” Colonel  Napier said distastefully. “,  suppose ,
have some bureaucrat up on New Chusan to thank for that.”

       A  cautious tour of the buildinJ  turned up several more Fists who had
died in the same fashion. Outside, the same old crowd of refuJees, beJJars,
pedestrians, and carJo-carryinJ bicyclists streamed on, about as undisturbed
as the YanJt]e.

       Colonel  Napier did  not return  to Madame PinJ's  the next week, but
Madame PinJ did not blame Nell for the loss of his custom. To the contrary,
she praised Nell   for  havinJ   correctly  divined  Napier's  wishes and  for
improvisinJ so well. “A  fine performance,” she said.

       Nell  had not really thouJht of her work as a performance, and for some
reason Madame PinJ's choice of words provoked her in a way that kept her
awake late that niJht, starinJ into the darkness above her bunk.

       Since she had been very  small, she had made up stories and recited
them to the  Primer, which  were often  diJested and incorporated into  the
Primer's stories. ,t  had come naturally  to  Nell  to  do  the same work  for
Madame PinJ. But now her boss was callinJ it a performance, and Nell had
to admit that it  was, in a way. Her  stories were beinJ diJested, not by the
Primer, but by another human beinJ, becominJ a part of that person's mind.

       That seemed simple enouJh, but the notion  troubled her for  a reason
that did not become clear until  she had lain half-asleep and fretted over it
for several hours.

       Colonel Napier did not know  her and probably never would. All of the
intercourse between him and Nell  had been mediated throuJh the actress

453
pretendinJ to   be  Miss  Braithwaite,   and throuJh   various  technoloJical
systems.

       Nonetheless she had touched him deeply. She had penetrated farther
into his  soul than  any lover.  ,f  Colonel Napier  had chosen to  return the
followinJ  week and Nell had not been present to make up the story for him,
would he have missed her? Nell  suspected that he would have. From  his
point of view,  some indefinable essence would have been wantinJ, and he
would have departed unsatisfied.

       ,f  this  could happen to Colonel Napier  in his  dealinJs with  Madame
PinJ's, could it  happen to Nell  in  her dealinJs  with  the Primer? She had
always felt   that  there was  some  essence in  the  book,  somethinJ  that
understood her and even loved her, somethinJ that forJave her when she did
wronJ and appreciated what she did riJht.

       When she'd been very younJ, she hadn't Tuestioned this at all; it  had
been part of the book's maJic. More  recently she had understood it as the
workinJs  of  a parallel  computer of  enormous si]e   and power, carefully
proJrammed to understand the human mind and Jive it what it needed.

       Now she wasn't so sure. Princess Nell's recent travels throuJh the lands
of KinJ Coyote, and the various castles with their increasinJly sophisticated
computers that were, in the end, nothinJ more  than TurinJ machines, had
cauJht her up  in  a  bewilderinJ  loJical  circle.  ,n  Castle TurinJ  she  had
learned that a TurinJ machine could not really  understand a human beinJ.
But the Primer was, itself,  a TurinJ machine, or  so she suspected; so how
could it understand Nell?

       Could it  be that the Primer was Must a conduit, a technoloJical system
that mediated between Nell and some human beinJ who really loved her? ,n
the end, she knew, this was basically how all ractives worked. The idea was
too alarminJ  to consider at  first,  and so she circled  around it  cautiously,
pokinJ at it from different  directions, like a cavewoman discoverinJ fire for
the first time. But as she settled in closer, she found that it warmed her and
satisfied her, and by the time her mind wandered into sleep, she had become

454
dependent upon it and would not consider JoinJ back into the cold and dark
place where she had been travelinJ for so many years.


                  Carl Hollywood  returns to Shanghai;  his forebears
                               in the territory  of the Lone Eagles; 
                                        Mrs.  Kwan's teahouse. 



Heavy rains had come rollinJ into ShanJhai from the West, like a harbinJer
of the Fists of RiJhteous Harmony and the thunderinJ herald of the cominJ
Celestial KinJdom. SteppinJ off  the airship from London, Carl  Hollywood
at once felt himself in a different ShanJhai from the one he had left; the old
city had always been wild, but in a sophisticated urban way, and now it was
wild like  a frontier  town. He sensed this ambience before he even left the
Aerodrome; it leaked in from the streets, like o]one before a thunderstorm.
LookinJ  out   the  windows,  he  could  see a  heavy  rain  rushinJ   down,
knockinJ all the nanotech out of the air and down into the Jutters, whence it
would eventually stain the HuanJ Pu and then the YanJt]e. Whether it was
the wild  atmosphere or the prospect of beinJ rained upon, he stopped his
porters short of  the  main  exit  doors so  that he  could chanJe  hats. The
hatboxes were stacked on one of the carts; his bowler went into the smallest
and topmost box, which was empty, and then he yanked the larJest box out
from underneath, poppinJ the stack, and took  out a  ten-Jallon Stetson of
breathtakinJ  width  and  sweep,  almost  like   a  head-mounted umbrella.
CastinJ an eye into the street, where a rushinJ brown stream carried litter,
road dust, cholera-ridden sewaJe, and tons of captive nanotech toward the
storm drains, he slipped off his leather shoes and exchanJed them for a pair
of  hand-tooled cowboy  boots,  made from   hides of   Jaudy  reptiles  and
avians, the pores of which had been corked with mites that would keep his
feet dry even if he chose to wade throuJh the Jutters.

       Thus  reconfiJured,  Carl  Hollywood  stepped out  into  the  streets of
ShanJhai. As he came out the doors of the Aerodrome, his duster billowed
in the cold wind of the storm and even the beJJars stepped away from him.
He paused to liJht a ciJar before proceedinJ and was not molested; even the

455
refuJees, who  were  starvinJ  or   at  least claimed  to   be,  derived  more
enMoyment from simply lookinJ at him than they would have from the coins
in his pocket. He walked the four blocks to  his hotel, pursued doJJedly by
the porters and by a crowd  of younJsters entranced by the siJht of  a real
cowboy.

       Carl's  Jrandfather was a  Lone  EaJle who  had ridden  out  from  the
crowdinJ and  sTualor of Silicon  Valley  in  the 1990s and  homesteaded a
patch of abandoned ranch alonJ a violent cold river on the eastern slope of
the Wind River RanJe. From  there he had made a comfortable livinJ  as a
freelance coder and consultant. His wife had left  him  for the briJht  liJhts
and social life  of  California  and  been startled when he  had manaJed to
persuade a MudJe that he was better eTuipped to raise their son than she was.
Grandfather had raised Carl Hollywood's father mostly in the out-of-doors,
huntinJ  and fishinJ   and choppinJ  wood  when  he  wasn't  sittinJ  inside
studyinJ his calculus. As the years went by, they had Jradually been Moined
by like-minded sorts with  similar  stories to tell,  so that by the time  of the
,nterreJnum they  had formed  a  community  of  several hundred,  loosely
spread over a few  thousand sTuare miles  of  near-wilderness but, in  the
electronic sense, as tiJhtly knit as any small villaJe in  the Old West. Their
technoloJical prowess, prodiJious wealth, and numerous larJe weapons had
made  them   a   danJerous  Jroup,   and   the   odd   pickup-truck-drivinJ
desperadoes who  attacked   an  isolated   ranch  had   found   themselves
surrounded and outJunned with cataclysmic swiftness. Grandfather loved to
tell stories of these criminals, how they had tried to excuse their own crimes
by pleadinJ that they were economically disadvantaJed or infected with the
disease of substance abuse, and how the Lone EaJles—many of whom had
overcome poverty  or   addiction  themselves—had dispatched them  with
firinJ  sTuads and left them posted around the edJe of their territory as NO
TRESPASS,NG siJns that even the illiterate could read.

       The  advent of   the Common  Economic  Protocol had  settled thinJs
down and, in the eyes of the old-timers, beJun to soften and ruin the place.
There was nothinJ like  JettinJ  up at  three in  the morninJ  and ridinJ  the
defensive perimeter in sub]ero cold,  with a  loaded rifle, to  build  up one's
sense of responsibility and community. Carl Hollywood's  clearest and best

456
memories were of JoinJ on such rides with his father. But as they sTuatted
on packed snow boilinJ coffee over a fire, they would listen to the radio and
hear stories about the Mihad raJinJ across ;inMianJ, drivinJ the Han  back
into the east, and about the first incidents of nanotech terrorism in Eastern
Europe. Carl's  father didn't  have  to  tell  him  that  their  community  was
rapidly acTuirinJ  the character of a historical  theme park, and that before
lonJ they  would  have to  Jive  up  the mounted patrols  for  more modern
defensive systems.

       Even after  those innovations had been made and the community had
mostly Moined up with the First Distributed Republic, Carl and his father and
Jrandfather had continued to  do  thinJs  in  the old  way, huntinJ  elk  and
heatinJ their  houses with  wood-burninJ   stoves and sittinJ   behind their
computer screens in dark rooms  late into  the niJht  hand-toolinJ  code in
assembly lanJuaJe. ,t was a purely male household (Carl's mother had died
when he was nine years old, in  a raftinJ  accident), and Carl  had fled the
place as soon as he'd found a way, JoinJ to San Francisco, then New York,
then London, and makinJ himself  useful in theatrical productions. But  the
older he Jot, the more he understood in how many ways he was rooted in
the place where he Jrew up, and he never felt  it  more purely than  he did
stridinJ down  a crowded street in  a ShanJhai thunderstorm, puffinJ  on a
thick ciJar and watchinJ the rain dribble  from the rim  of his hat. The most
intense and clear  sensations of his  life  had flooded  into  his  younJ  and
defenseless mind durinJ  his first  dawn  patrol,  knowinJ  the desperadoes
were out there somewhere. He kept returninJ to these memories in later life,
tryinJ to  recapture the same purity and intensity of  sensation, or tryinJ to
Jet his ractors to  feel it.  Now  for the first  time  in thirty  years he felt  the
same thinJ, this time on the streets of ShanJhai, hot and pulsinJ on the edJe
of a dynastic rebellion, like the arteries of an old man about to have his first
orJasm in years.

       He merely  touched base at his hotel, where he stuffed the pockets of
his coat with a sheaf of  foolscap, a fountain pen, a silver box  loaded with
ciJars like rounds in an ammo clip,  and some tiny containers of nanosnuff
that he could use to adMust the functioninJ of his brain and body. He also
hefted a  heavy walkinJ-stick,   a real  wi]ard's  staff  loaded  with  security

457
aerostats that would shepherd him back to the hotel in the event of  a riot.
Then he returned once more to the streets, shoulderinJ for a mile throuJh
the crowd  until  he reached a teahouse where he  had passed many lonJ
niJhts durinJ  his  tenure at the Parnasse. Old Mrs.  Kwan  welcomed him
warmly, bowinJ  many times and showinJ him  to his  favorite corner table
where he could look out on the intersection of NanMinJ Road and a narrow
side street Mammed with tiny market stalls. All he could see now were the
backs and buttocks of people in the street, Mammed up aJainst the Jlass by
the pressure of the crowd. He ordered a biJ pot of his favorite Jreen tea, the
most expensive kind,  picked  in  April   when the  leaves were tender  and
younJ, and spread out his sheets of foolscap across the table. This teahouse
was fully  inteJrated into  the worldwide  media network, and so  the paJes
automatically Macked themselves in. 8nder  Carl  Hollywood's   murmured
commands they beJan to fill themselves with columns of animated text and
windows bearinJ  imaJes and  cine feeds.  He took  his  first  sip  of  tea—
always the  best one—withdrew   his  biJ  fountain  pen  from   his  pocket,
removed the  lid,   and  touched  it   to  the  paper.  He  beJan  to  inscribe
commands onto the paJe, in words and drawinJs. As he finished the words,
they were enacted before him, and as he drew the lines between the boxes
and circles, links were made and information flowed.

       At  the bottom of  the paJe he wrote the word M,RANDA   and drew a
circle around it.  ,t was not  connected to anythinJ else in the diaJram  yet.
He hoped that  before lonJ  it  would  be.  Carl Hollywood   worked  on his
papers late into the niJht, and Mrs. Kwan continued to replenish his teapot
and to  brinJ  him  little  sweets and decorated the  edJe of  his table  with
candles as niJht fell and the teahouse darkened, for she remembered that he
liked to  work by  candleliJht. The  Chinese people outside, separated from
him  by  half  an inch  of  crosslinked  diamond, watched  with  their  noses
makinJ  white   ellipses  aJainst   the  pane,  their   faces  JlowinJ   in   the
candleliJht like ripe peaches hanJinJ in dark lush foliaJe.


                 The Hackworths in  transit, and in  London; the East
                   End;  a remarkable boatride; Dramatis Personae; 
                                         a night  at the theatre. 

458
Smooth, fine-Jrained arctic  clouds undulated slowly  like  snow drifts  into
the distance, a thousand miles lookinJ like the width of a front yard, lit  but
not warmed by a low apricot sun that never Tuite went down. Fiona lay on
her stomach on the top bunk, lookinJ out the window, watchinJ  her breath
condense on the pane and then evaporate in the parched air.

       “Father?” she said, very softly, to see if he was awake.

       He  wasn't, but he  woke up  Tuickly, as  if  he'd been in  one of  those
dreams that Must skims beneath the surface of consciousness, like an airship
clippinJ a few cloud-tops. “Yes?”

       “Who  is the Alchemist? Why are you lookinJ for him?”

       “,  would  rather not explain why ,'m lookinJ  for  him. Let us say that ,
have incurred  obliJations  that  want  settlinJ.”   Her  father  seemed more
preoccupied with the second part of the Tuestion than she'd expected, and
his voice was steeped in reJret.

       “Who  is he?” she insisted Jently.

       “Oh.  Well, my darlinJ, if  , knew that, ,'d have found him.”

       “Father!”

       “What  sort  of  a person is  he? ,  haven't  been afforded many  clues,
unfortunately. ,'ve tried to  draw some deductions from the sorts of people
who are lookinJ for him, and the sort of person , am.”

       “Pardon me,  Father, but what bearinJ does your own  nature have on
that of the Alchemist?”

       “More  than one knowledJeable sort has arrived at the conclusion that
,'m Must the riJht man to find  this fellow,  even thouJh ,  know  nothinJ of
criminals  and   espionaJe and   so  forth.   ,'m   Must a  nanotechnoloJical
enJineer.”

459
       “That's  not  true, Father!  You're ever  so much  more than  that. You
know  so  many stories—you  told   me  so many,  when  you  were  Jone,
remember?”

       “,  suppose so,” he allowed, stranJely diffident.

       “And  ,  read it every niJht.  And thouJh  the stories were about faeries
and pirates and dMinns and such, , could always sense that you were behind
them. Like the puppeteer pullinJ the strinJs and imbuinJ  them with voices
and personalities. So , think you're more than an enJineer. ,t's Must that you
need a maJic book to brinJ it out.”

       “Well  .         .         . that's a point , had not considered,” her father said,
his voice suddenly emotional.  She fouJht the temptation  to peer over the
edJe of the bed and look at his  face, which would  have embarrassed him.
,nstead she curled up in her bed and closed her eyes.

       “Whatever   you  may  think   of  me,  Fiona—and  ,   must  say  ,   am
pleasantly surprised that  you  think  of  me so  favourably—to  those who
despatched me on this errand, , am an enJineer. Without beinJ arroJant, ,
miJht add that , have advanced rapidly in that field  and attained a position
of not  inconsiderable responsibility. As this  is the  only characteristic that
distinJuishes me from other men, it can be the only reason , was chosen to
find  the  Alchemist.  From  this  ,   infer  that  the  Alchemist  is  himself  a
nanotechnoloJical researcher of some sophistication, and that he is thouJht
to be  developinJ  a product  that  is of   interest to  more than  one of   the
Powers.”

       “Are  you talkinJ about the Seed, Father?”

       He was silent for a few moments. When he spoke aJain, his voice was
hiJh and tiJht. “The Seed. How did you know about the Seed?”

       “You  told me about it,  Father. You told me it  was a danJerous thinJ,
and that Protocol Enforcement mustn't allow it  to be created. And besides
…”

460
       “Besides what?”

       She was on the verJe of remindinJ him that her dreams had been filled
with seeds for the last several years, and that every story she had seen in her
Primer had been replete with them: seeds that Jrew up into castles; draJon's
teeth that Jrew up  into soldiers;  seeds that sprouted into Jiant beanstalks
leadinJ to alternate universes in the clouds; and seeds, Jiven to hospitable,
barren couples by itinerant  crones, that Jrew up  into  plants with  bulJinJ
pods that contained happy, kickinJ babies.

       But  she sensed that if she mentioned this directly, he would slam the
steel door in  her face—a door that  was tantali]inJly   cracked open at the
moment.

       “Why  do you think that Seeds are so interestinJ?” she essayed.

       “They   are  interestinJ   inasmuch  as  a  beaker  of   nitroJlycerin   is
interestinJ,” he said. “They are subversive technoloJy. You are not to speak
of Seeds aJain, Fiona—CryptNet aJents could be anywhere, listeninJ to our
conversation.”

       Fiona siJhed. When her  father spoke freely, she could sense the man
who had told her the stories. When certain subMects were broached, he drew
down his veil and became Must another Victorian Jentleman. ,t was irksome.
But she could sense how the same characteristic, in a man who was not her
father, could be provocative. ,t was such an obvious weakness that neither
she nor any woman could resist the temptation to exploit it—a mischievous
and hence tantali]inJ notion  that was to  occupy much of Fiona's thinkinJ
for the next few  days, as they encountered other members of their tribe in
London.

         

After a simple dinner of beer and pasties in a pub on the frinJes of the City,
they rode south across the Tower BridJe, pierced a shallow  layer of  posh
development alonJ the riJht bank of the river, and entered into Southwark.

461
As in other Atlantan  districts of  London, Feed lines had been worked into
the sinews of  the place, coursinJ  throuJh  utility  tunnels,  clinJinJ  to  the
clammy undersides of bridJes, and sneakinJ into  buildinJs  throuJh small
holes bored in the foundations. The tiny  old houses and flats of  this once
impoverished Tuarter had mostly been refurbished into toeholds for younJ
Atlantans from  all   around the  AnJlosphere, poor  in   eTuity but  rich   in
expectations, who had come to the Jreat city to incubate their careers. The
businesses on the Jround floors tended to be pubs, coffeehouses, and music
halls. As father and dauJhter worked  their way  east, Jenerally parallelinJ
the river, the lustre that  was so evident near the approaches to the bridJe
beJan to wear thin in places, and the ancient character of the neiJhborhood
beJan to  assert itself,  as the  bones of   the knuckles  reveal  their  shape
beneath the stretched skin  of  a  fist.  Wide  Japs developed  between the
waterfront developments, allowinJ   them to  look  across the  river  into  a
district  whose  blanket   of  eveninJ   foJ  was   already  stained  with   the
carcinoJenic candy-colored hues of biJ mediatrons.

       Fiona  Hackworth  noticed a  Jlow  in  the  air,  which  resolved into  a
constellation when she blinked and focused. A pinprick  of  Jreen liJht,  an
infinitesimal  chip  of emerald, touched the  surface of  her eye, expandinJ
into a cloud of liJht.  She blinked twice, and it  was Jone. Sooner or later it
and many others would make their way  to the corners of her eyes, JivinJ
her a JrotesTue appearance. She drew a handkerchief from her sleeve and
wiped her eyes. The presence of so many lidar-emittinJ mites prompted her
to reali]e  that they  had been infiltratinJ  a  Jreat expanse of foJ  for  some
minutes without  really   beinJ  aware of  it;   moisture from  the  river  was
condensinJ around the microscopic Juardians of the border. Colored liJht
flashed vaJuely across the screen of foJ before them, silhouettinJ  a stone
column planted in  the center of  the road: winJs  of  a Jryphon,  horn of  a
unicorn, crisp and black  aJainst a lurid cosmos. A  constable stood beside
the pediment, symbolically JuardinJ the bar. He nodded to the Hackworths
and mumbled somethinJ Jruff but polite throuJh his chinstrap as father and
dauJhter rode out of  New Atlantis  and into  a Jaudy  clave full  of  loutish
thetes scrumminJ and chantinJ before the entrances of pubs. Fiona cauJht
siJht of  an old  8nion   -ack, then did  a  double-take and reali]ed  that the
limbs of  the  St. Andrew's  Cross had been enhanced with  stars, like  the

462
Confederate Battle FlaJ.  She Jave her  chevaline a nudJe  and pulled  up
nearly abreast with her father.

       Then the city became darker and Tuieter, thouJh no less crowded, and
for a few blocks they saw only dark-haired men with mustaches and women
who were nothinJ more than columns of black  fabric. Then Fiona smelled
anise and Jarlic, and they passed into Vietnamese territory for a short time.
She would have enMoyed stoppinJ at one of the sidewalk café for a bowl of
pho, but her  father rode on,  pursuinJ the  tide that was  ebbinJ down  the
Thames, and in a few more minutes they had come once aJain to the bank.
,t was lined with ancient masonry warehouses—a cateJory of structure now
so obsolete as to defy explanation—which had been converted into offices.

       A  pier rode on the surface of the river, ridinJ up and down on the tide,
linked  to  the rim  of   the Jranite  embankment by  a  hinJed JanJway.  A
shaJJy black vessel was tied  up to  the pier,  but it  was completely  unlit,
visible only by  its black shadow aJainst the charcoal-Jray water. After the
chevalines had planted themselves and the Hackworths  had dismounted,
they were able to hear low voices cominJ from below.

       -ohn  Hackworth  withdrew  some tickets  from  his breast pocket  and
asked them  to   illuminate   themselves; but  they   were  printed  on  old-
fashioned paper that did not contain its own enerJy source, and so he finally
had to  use  the microtorch   danJlinJ  from  his  watch  chain.  Apparently
satisfied that they had arrived at the riJht  place, he offered  Fiona his arm
and escorted her down  the  JanJway to  the  pier. A  tiny   flickerinJ  liJht
bobbed toward them and  resolved into  an Afro-Caribbean  man, wearinJ
rimless Jlasses and carryinJ an antiTue hurricane lamp. Fiona watched his
face as  his  enormous eyes,  yellowed  like   antiTue ivory   billiard   balls,
scanned their tickets. His skin was rich and warm and JlowinJ  in the liJht
of the  candle, and he smelled faintly  of  citrus  combined with  somethinJ
darker and less inJratiatinJ. When he was finished, he looked up, not at the
Hackworths but off  into  the distance, turned his  back, and ambled away.
-ohn Hackworth stood there for a few moments, awaitinJ instructions, then
straiJhtened, sTuared his shoulders, and led Fiona  across the pier to  the
boat.

463
       ,t  was eiJht  or ten meters lonJ. There was no  JanJway, and persons
already on board had to reach out and clutch their arms and pull them in, a
breach of  formality  that  happened so Tuickly  that  they  had no  time  to
become uncomfortable.

       The boat was basically a larJe flat open tub, not much more than a life
raft, with  some controls  in the  bow and some sort  of modern  and hence
neJliJibly   small  propulsion  system built   into   the stern.  As  their   eyes
adMusted to the dim liJht scatterinJ throuJh the foJ, they could see perhaps
a do]en other passenJers around the edJe of the boat, seated so that wakes
from passinJ vessels would not upset them. SeeinJ wisdom in this, -ohn led
Fiona to the only  remaininJ  open space, and they sat down between two
other Jroups:  a trio  of  younJ  Nipponese men  forcinJ  ciJarettes on  one
another, and a man and woman in bohemian-but-expensive clothes, sippinJ
laJer from cans and conversinJ in Canadian accents.

       The  man  from  the  pier  cast  off  the  painters  and vaulted  aboard.
Another functionary had taken the controls and Jently accelerated into the
current, cuttinJ  the throttle  at one  point and  swinJinJ  her about  into an
oncominJ wake. When the boat entered the main channel and came up to
speed, it very  Tuickly  became chilly,  and  all  the passenJers murmured,
demandinJ more  warmth   from  their   thermoJenic  clothinJ.   The  Afro-
Caribbean man made a circuit luJJinJ  a heavy chest stocked with cans of
laJer and splits of pinot  noir. Conversation stopped for several minutes as
the passenJers, all driven by the same primal impulses, turned their  faces
into the  cool  wind  and relaxed into  the Jentle  thumpinJ  of  hull  aJainst
waves.

       The  trip   took  the  better  part  of   an  hour.  After  several  minutes,
conversation resumed, most of the passenJers remaininJ within their little
Jroups. The refreshment chest made a few more circuits. -ohn Hackworth
beJan to reali]e,  from a  few subtleties, that one of  the Nipponese youths
was much more intoxicated than he was lettinJ on and had probably spent a
few hours in a dockside pub before reachinJ the pier. He took a drink from
the chest every time  it  came by, and half  an  hour into  the ride,  he rose
unsteadily to his feet, leaned over the edJe, and threw  up. -ohn turned to

464
smirk at  his dauJhter. The boat  struck an unseen wave, rollinJ  sideways
into  the trouJh.  Hackworth  clutched first   at the  railinJ   and then at  his
dauJhter's arm.

       Fiona screamed. She was starinJ over -ohn's shoulder at the Nipponese
youths. -ohn turned around to see that there were only two of them now; the
sick one was  Jone, and the  other two  had flunJ   their bellies  across the
Junwale and stretched out their arms, finJers  like white  rays shininJ  into
the black water. -ohn felt  Fiona's arm pull  free  from his  Jrasp, and as he
turned toward her, he Must saw her vaultinJ over the rail.

       ,t  was over before he had an opportunity to Jet really scared. The crew
dealt  with   the  matter   with   a  practiced  efficiency   that   suJJested  to
Hackworth that the Nipponese man was really an actor, the entire incident
part of  the production.  The Afro-Caribbean  man cursed and  shouted for
them to hanJ on, his voice pure and powerful as a Stradivarius cello, a staJe
voice. He  inverted the  cooler, dumpinJ  out  all  the  beer and wine,  then
snapped it shut and flunJ it over the stern as a life preserver. Meanwhile the
pilot   was   swinJinJ    the  boat   round.   Several   passenJers, includinJ
Hackworth, had turned on microtorches and focused their beams on Fiona,
whose skirts had inflated as she'd Mumped in feet-first and now surrounded
her like a raft  of flowers.  With one hand she was clutchinJ the Nipponese
man's collar, and with  the other, the handle of  the ice  chest. She did not
have the strenJth or buoyancy to hold the drunken man out of the water, and
so both of them were swamped by the estuary's rollinJ waves.

       The man with the dreadlocks hauled Fiona out first and handed her off
to her father. The fabricules makinJ up her clothinJ—countless mites linked
elbow-to-elbow in  a two-dimensional array—went to work  pumpinJ away
the water trapped in the interstices. Fiona was wreathed in a sinuous veil of
mist that burned with  the captured liJht  of the torches. Her thick  red hair
had been freed from the confines of her hat, which had been torn away by
the waves and now fell about her in a cape of fire.

       She was  lookinJ  defiantly  at Hackworth,  whose adrenal Jlands had
finally  Mumped into the endocrinoloJical fray. When he saw his dauJhter in

465
this way,  it  felt  as thouJh  someone were inexorably  slidinJ  a  hundred-
pound block of ice up  the lenJth of his spine. When the sensation reached
his medulla, he staJJered and nearly had  to sit  down. She had somehow
flunJ  herself  throuJh  an  unknown  and  unmarked  barrier  and  become
supernatural, a naiad risinJ from  the waves cloaked in  fire  and steam. ,n
some rational compartment of  his mind  that had now  become irrelevant,
Hackworth wondered whether Dramatis Personae (for this was the name of
the troupe that  was runninJ  this  show) had  Jot  some nanosites into his
system, and if so what exactly they were doinJ to his mind.

       Water streamed from Fiona's skirts  and ran between the floorboards,
and then she was dry, except for her face and hair. She wiped her face on
her sleeves, iJnorinJ her father's proffered handkerchief. No words passed
between them, and they did not embrace, as if Fiona were conscious now of
the impact she was havinJ upon her father and all the others—a faculty that,
Hackworth supposed, must be  hiJhly  acute in  sixteen-year-old Jirls.  By
now the Nipponese man was Must about finished couJhinJ water out of his
lunJs and JaspinJ piteously for air.  As soon as he had the airways up and
runninJ, he spoke hoarsely and lenJthily. One of his companions translated.
“He says that we are not  alone—that the water is filled   with spirits—that
they spoke to him.  He followed  them  beneath the waves. But feelinJ  his
spirit about to leave his body, he felt fear and swam to the surface and was
saved by the younJ woman. He says that the spirits are talkinJ to all of us,
and we must listen to them!”

       This  was, needless to say, embarrassinJ, and so all of the passenJers
doused their torches and turned their backs on the stricken passenJer. But
when Hackworth's eyes had adMusted, he took another look at this man and
saw that the exposed portions of his flesh had beJun to radiate colored liJht.

       He  looked at Fiona and saw that  a band of white  liJht  encircled her
head like a tiara, briJht  enouJh that  it shone red throuJh  her hair, with  a
Mewel centered upon her forehead. Hackworth marveled at this siJht from a
distance, knowinJ that she wanted to be free of him for now.

466
       Fat liJhts  hunJ low above the water, describinJ the envelopes of Jreat
ships, slidinJ   past each other  as their   parallax shifted  with   the  steady
proJress of  the boat. They  had  come to  a place near  the mouth  of  the
estuary but not  on  the  usual shippinJ  lanes, where  ships lay  at  anchor
awaitinJ shifts  in tides, winds, or  markets. One constellation of liJhts  did
not move but only Jrew  larJer as they drew toward it. ExperimentinJ  with
shadows and examininJ the pattern of liJht  cast upon the water from  this
vessel, Hackworth concluded that the liJhts were beinJ deliberately  shone
into their faces so that they could not make any MudJments about the nature
of the source.

       The foJ  slowly  conJealed into a wall  of  rust, so vast and featureless
that it miJht have been ten or a hundred feet distant. The helmsman waited
until they  were about to  ram it,  then cut the  enJines. The raft lost  speed
instantly and nu]]led  the hull  of  the biJ ship. Chains, slimy  and drippinJ,
descended from the firmament, diverJinJ in Hackworth's view like radiance
emanatinJ from  some heavy-industrial  demiJod,  clankinJ  harbinJers  of
iron  that the  crew, heads thrown  back ecstatically,  throats bared to  this
kinky revelation, received into their bosoms. They snapped the chains onto
metal loops fixed into the floor  of the boat. Shackled, the boat rose free of
the water and beJan to ascend the wall of rust, which  soared vaJuely into
the infinite foJ. Suddenly there was a railinJ, an open deck beyond it, pools
of liJht  here and there, a few  red ciJar-coals reciprocatinJ throuJh space.
The deck swunJ under and rose to shove at the hull  of  the little  boat. As
they disembarked, they could see similar boats scattered about.

       “DodJy”   did not beJin to describe the reputation of Dramatis Personae
in the New Atlantan parts of London, but that was the adMective they always
used anyway, delivered in a near-whisper, with brows raised nearly into the
hairline and eyes JlancinJ  siJnificantly   over the shoulder. ,t  had Tuickly
become clear to Hackworth that a man could Jet a bad reputation simply for
havinJ known  that Dramatis  Personae existed—at the same time, it  was
clear that almost everyone had heard about it. Rather than beinJ spattered
with any more opprobrium, he had souJht the tickets amonJ other tribes.

467
       After  all this it  did not surprise him in the least to see that most of the
attendees were fellow Victorians,  and not  Must younJ bachelors havinJ a
niJht out, but ostensibly respectable couples, strollinJ the decks in their top
hats and veils.

       Fiona vaulted  out of  the boat before it  even touched the deck of  the
ship and  vanished. She had  repatterned her  dress, ditchinJ  the  chint]y
flowered pattern  for  basic white,  and skipped off   into  the darkness, her
inteJral tiara JlowinJ  like  a halo.  Hackworth took a  slow turn around the
deck, watchinJ his fellow-tribesmen tryinJ  to solve the followinJ  problem:
Jet close enouJh to  another couple to recoJni]e  them  without  JettinJ so
close that they can recoJni]e  you. From time  to time,  couples recoJni]ed
each other simultaneously and had to  say somethinJ: the  women tittered
wickedly,  and the men  lauJhed from  their  bellies  and called each other
scoundrels, the words JlancinJ off the deckplates and buryinJ themselves in
the foJ like arrows fired into a bale of cotton.

       Some kind  of  amplified  music emanated from compartments below;
atonal power chords came up throuJh the  deck like  seismic disturbances.
She was a bulk carJo carrier, now empty and bobbinJ,  surprisinJly  Mittery
for somethinJ so biJ.

       Hackworth was alone and separate from all humanity, a feelinJ he had
Jrown up  with,  like   a childhood  friend  livinJ   next door.  He had  found
Gwen by some miracle and lost touch with that old  friend for  a few years,
but now he and solitude  were back toJether, out for  a stroll,  familiar  and
comfortable.  A   makeshift  bar   amidships  had  drawn   a  do]en   or   so
conJreJants, but Hackworth knew that he could not Moin in with them. He
had been born without the ability  to blend and sociali]e  as some are born
without hands.

       “StandinJ above it all?” said a voice. “Or standinJ aside perhaps?”

       ,t  was a man in a clown outfit. Hackworth recoJni]ed it, vaJuely, as an
advertisinJ fetish for an old American fast-food chain. But the costume was
conspicuously ill-used, as if  it  were the sole Jarment of  a refuJee. ,t  had

468
been patched all over with swatches of chint],  Chinese silk, studded black
leather, charcoal-Jray pinstripe, and MunJle camo. The clown wore inteJral
makeup—his face Jlowed  like  an  inMection-molded plastic toy from  the
previous century with a liJht bulb stuck inside the head. ,t was disturbinJ to
see him talk,  like  watchinJ  one of  those animated CAT  scans of a  man
swallowinJ.

       “Are   you   of  it?   Or  Must in  it?”   the  Clown  said,  and  looked  at
Hackworth expectantly.

       As  soon as Hackworth  had reali]ed,  Tuite  some time  aJo, that  this
Dramatis Personae thinJ was JoinJ to be some kind of participatory theatre,
he had been dreadinJ this moment: his  first  cue. “Please excuse me,” he
said in a tense and not altoJether steady voice, “this is not my milieu.”

       “That's  for  damn fuckinJ  sure,”  said the Clown.  “Put  these on,”  he
continued,  takinJ   somethinJ  out   of   his   pocket.  He   reached out   to
Hackworth, who was two or three meters away from him—but  shockinJly,
his hand detached itself from his arm and flew  throuJh the air, the smutty
white Jlove  like a  dirty ball  of  ice tumblinJ  elliptically   throuJh the inner
planets. ,t  shoved  somethinJ  into  Hackworth's  breast pocket  and  then
withdrew;  but because Hackworth  was watchinJ,  it  described  a smooth
sudden fiJure-eiJht pattern in space before reattachinJ itself to the stump of
the forearm. Hackworth reali]ed  that the clown  was mechanical. “Put 'em
on and  be yourself,  mister  alienated loner steppenwolf  bemused distant
meta-i]inJ  technocrat rationalist fuckinJ shithead.” The Clown spun on his
heel to leave; his floppy clown  shoes were built around some kind of trick
heel with a swivel  built  in, so that when he spun on his heel he really  did
spin on his heel, performinJ several complete rotations before stoppinJ with
his back turned to Hackworth and storminJ away. “Revolutionary, ain't it?”
he snapped.

       The  thinJ   in  Hackworth's  pocket  was  a  pair  of   dark  sunJlasses:
wraparounds with  a  JlimmerinJ   rainbow  finish,  the  sort  of  thinJ  that,
decades aJo, would have been worn by a MaJnum-slinJinJ rebel cop in  a
prematurely canceled television series. Hackworth unfolded them and slid

469
the polished ends of the  bows cautiously over  his temples. As the  lenses
approached,  he   could    see  liJht     cominJ    from    them;   they   were
phenomenoscopes. ThouJh in this  context, the  word  phantascope miJht
have been more appropriate. The imaJe Jrew to fill his siJht but would not
focus until he put them all the way on, so he reluctantly plummeted into the
hallucination until it  resolved, and Must then the bows behind his ears came
alive, stretched, and Jrew around the back of  his skull  like a rubber band
snappinJ in  reverse, MoininJ in  the back  to  form  an  unbreakable band.
“Release,” Hackworth said, and then ran throuJh a litany of other standard
yuvree commands. The spectacles would not  release his head. Finally,  a
cone of  liJht  pierced space from  somewhere above and behind him  and
splashed across a staJe. FootliJhts came up, and a man in a top hat emerJed
from behind a curtain. “Welcome to your show,” he said. “You can remove
the Jlasses at any time by securinJ a  standinJ ovation from  not less than
ninety percent of the audience.” Then the liJhts  and curtain vanished, and
Hackworth was left with what  he had seen before, namely, a cybernetically
enhanced niJht-vision renderinJ of the deck of the ship.

       He   tried  a  few   more  commands. Most   phenomenoscopes had a
transparent mode, or at least translucent, that allowed the wearer to  view
what was really  there. But  these ones were doJJedly  opaTue and would
only  show him  a  mediatronic renderinJ  of  the scene. The  strollinJ  and
chattinJ  theatreJoers were represented by  preposterously oversimplified
wire-frames, a display technoloJy unused these eiJhty years or so, clearly
intended to irritate Hackworth. Each fiJure  had a larJe placard strapped to
its chest:

 

                          JARED  MASON GRIFFIN   III,   aged 35
                                (too late to become an interesting 
                                           character like you!) 
                             Nephew of an earl-level Equity  Lord 
                                         (don't you envy him?) 
                          Married  to that sunken bitch on his right 
                                 They go on these little escapades 

470
                                to escape their own crippled lives.
                                          (why  are you here?) 

 

       Hackworth looked down and tried to read the placard on his own chest
but couldn't focus on it.

       When    he   walked    around   the   deck,    his   viewpoint    chanJed
correspondinJly. There was also a standard interface that  enabled him to
“fly”  around the ship; Hackworth himself remained in one fixed location, of
course, but his  viewpoint  in  the  spectacles became unlinked to  his real
coordinates. Whenever  he  used this   mode,  the  followinJ   leJend  was
superimposed on his view in Jiant flashinJ red block letters:

 

                             JOHN PERCIVAL  HACKWORTH'S
                                    GODLIKE  PERSPECTIVE 

 

       sometimes accompanied by  a cartoon  of  a  wi]ardly   sort of  fellow
sittinJ  atop a  mountain peerinJ  down into  a  villaJe  of  sTualid midJets.
Because of  this  annoyance,  Hackworth  did   not  use  this  feature  very
freTuently. But on his initial  reconnaissance, he discovered a few items of
interest.

       For  one thinJ,  the Nipponese fellow  who  had Jot  pissed and fallen
overboard had encountered a Jroup of several other people who had, by a
remarkable coincidence, also fallen out of their boats on the way here, and
who upon beinJ rescued had all beJun to emit colored liJht and see visions
that they  insisted on  recountinJ to  anyone in  the vicinity.   These people
convened into   a  poorly   orJani]ed   chorus,  all   shoutinJ   at  once  and
articulatinJ visions that seemed to be linked in an approximate way—as if
they had all Must now awakened from the same dream and were all doinJ an

471
eTually bad Mob describinJ it. They stuck toJether despite their differences,
drawn  toJether  by   the  same  mysterious  attractive   force  that   causes
streetcorner crackpots to set up their  soapboxes riJht next  to each other.
Shortly  after  Hackworth  ]oomed  toward  them  in  his  phenomenoscopic
view, they beJan to hallucinate somethinJ alonJ the lines of a Jiant eyeball
peerinJ at them from the heavens, the black skin of its eyelids studded with
stars.

       Hackworth  skulked away and focused in on another larJe JatherinJ: a
couple of  do]en   older  people of   the trim,   fit,  and  active  style,  tennis
sweaters draped over their shoulders and sensible walkinJ shoes firmly but
not too tiJhtly   laced to  their feet, pilinJ   off  a small  airship that had Must
moored on the  old  helicopter pad  near the ship's stern.  The airship  had
many windows  and  was festooned with   mediatronic  advertisements for
aerial tours of London.  As the tourists climbed  off, they  tended to stop in
their tracks, so that a severe bottleneck was forever forminJ. They had to be
Joaded into the outer darkness by their tour Juide, a younJ actress dressed
in a cheesy devil outfit, complete with flashinJ red horns and a trident.

       “,s  this  Whitechapel?”  one of  them said to  the foJ,  speakinJ  in an
American accent. These people were obviously members of the Heartland
tribe, a prosperous phyle closely allied with New Atlantis that had absorbed
many responsible, sane, educated, white, Midwestern, middle-class types.
ListeninJ in  on  their furtive  conversations, Hackworth  divined that  these
tourists had been brouJht in from  a Holiday  ,nn in  KensinJton, under the
ruse that they were JoinJ to take the -ack  the Ripper tour in  Whitechapel.
As  Hackworth  listened,  the  diabolical   tour  Juide  explained  that  their
drunken airship pilot had accidentally flown them to a floatinJ  theatre, and
they were welcome to enMoy the show, which would be startinJ shortly;  a
free (to them) performance of Cats, the lonJest-runninJ musical of all time,
which most of them had already seen on their first niJht in London.

       Hackworth,  still  peerinJ throuJh the mockinJ  red letters, did a Tuick
scan belowdecks. There were a do]en cavernous compartments down there.
Four of  them had  been consolidated into a  capacious theatre; four more
served as the staJe and backstaJe. Hackworth located his dauJhter there.

472
She was seated on a throne of liJht, rehearsinJ some lines. Apparently she'd
already been cast in a maMor role.

       “,  don't want you  to watch me like that,”  she said, and vanished from
Hackworth's display in a burst of liJht.

       The ship's foJhorn sounded. The sound continued to echo sporadically
from other ships in the area. Hackworth returned to his natural view of the
deck Must in time to see a bla]inJ fiJment  rushinJ toward him:  the Clown
aJain, who  apparently  possessed the special power  of  movinJ  throuJh
Hackworth's display  like  a  phantasm. “GoinJ  to  stay up  here all  niJht,
JuessinJ the distance to the other  ships by timinJ   the echoes? Or may ,
show you to your seat?”

       Hackworth  decided that the best thinJ was not to be ruffled. “Please,”
he said.

       “Well,  there it is  then,” said the Clown, JesturinJ with  one maculated
Jlove  toward   a  plain  wooden  chair   riJht   before  them  on  the   deck.
Hackworth did  not  believe it  was really  there, because he hadn't seen it
before now. But the spectacles allowed him no way to tell.

       He stepped forward like  a man makinJ his way to  the toilet in  a dark
and unfamiliar   room,  knees bent,  hands outstretched,  movinJ  his  feet
JinJerly so as not to bark shins or toes on anythinJ. The Clown had drawn
to one side and was watchinJ him scornfully. “,s this what  you call JettinJ
into your role? Think you can Jet away with scientific rationalism all niJht?
What's JoinJ to happen the first time you actually start believinJ  what you
see?”

       Hackworth  found his seat exactly where the display told him it would
be, but it  wasn't a  simple wooden chair;  it  was foam-covered and it  had
arms. ,t was like a seat in  a theatre, but when he Jroped to either side, he
did not find any others. So he depressed the seat and fell into it.

       “You'll  be needinJ this,” the Clown  said, and snapped a tubular obMect
into the palm  of Hackworth's  hand. Hackworth was Must recoJni]inJ it  as

473
some kind of torch when somethinJ loud  and violent happened Must below
him. His feet, which had been restinJ on the deckplates, were now danJlinJ
in air. ,n fact, all  of him  was danJlinJ. A trapdoor had flown  open beneath
him, and he was in free fall. “EnMoy the show,” the Clown said, tippinJ his
hat and peerinJ down  at him  throuJh  a rapidly  diminishinJ  sTuare hole.
“And while  you're acceleratinJ toward the center of the earth at nine point
eiJht meters per second sTuared, riddle me this: We can fake  sounds, we
can fake imaJes, we can even fake the wind  blowinJ  over your  face, but
how do we fake the sensation of free fall?”

       Pseudopods had sprouted from the chair's foam and wrapped around
Hackworth's waist and upper thiJhs. This was fortunate as he had Jone into
a slow  backward spin  and soon found  himself  fallinJ  face-first,  passinJ
throuJh Jreat amorphous clouds of liJht: a collection of old chandeliers that
Dramatis Personae had scavenJed from condemned buildinJs. The Clown
was riJht: Hackworth was definitely  in  free fall, a sensation that could not
be faked with spectacles. ,f his eyes and ears were to be believed, he was
plunJinJ toward  the floor  of  the biJ  theatre he had reconnoitered earlier.
But it was not Jrooved with neat rows of seats like an ordinary theatre. The
seats were present but scattered about randomly. And some of them were
movinJ.

       The floor  continued to accelerate toward him until he Jot really scared
and started to scream. Then he felt  Jravity  aJain as some force beJan to
slow him down. The  chair spun around so that Hackworth was lookinJ up
into the irreJular  constellation of chandeliers, and the acceleration shot up
to several Jees. Then back to normal. The chair rotated so that he was on
the level  once  more,  and the  phenomenoscope went brilliant,   blindinJ
white. The earpieces were pumpinJ white noise at him;  but as it  beJan to
diminish, he reali]ed it was actually the sound of applause.

       Hackworth  was  not  able to  see anythinJ  until  he  fiddled  with  the
interface and Jot back  to a more  schematic view of  the theatre. Then he
determined that the place was about half full of theatreJoers, movinJ about
independently on their  chairs, which  were somehow motori]ed,   and that
several do]en   of  them  were  aiminJ   their  torches  toward  him,   which

474
accounted for   the  blindinJ   liJht.   He  was  on   center staJe,  the  main
attraction. He wondered if he was supposed to say somethinJ. A  line was
written across his spectacles: Thanks very much, ladies and gentlemen, for
letting me drop in. We have a great show for you tonight. …

       Hackworth  wondered if  he was somehow obliJated to read this  line.
But soon the  torches turned away from  him,  as more audience members
beJan to rain down  throuJh the  astral plane of the chandeliers. WatchinJ
them fall,  Hackworth  reali]ed  that  he'd seen somethinJ like  it  before  at
amusement parks: This was nothinJ  more than  bunJee-MumpinJ. ,t's Must
that the spectacles had declined to show Hackworth his own bunJee cord,
Must to add an extra frisson to the whole experience.

       The armrest of Hackworth's chair included some controls that enabled
him to  move  it  around the  floor  of  the house, which  was  cone-shaped,
slopinJ  sharply  in  toward  the  center. A   pedestrian would   have found
difficult    footinJ,   but   the  chair   had   powerful   nanotech  motors   and
compensated for the slope.

       ,t    was   a   round   theatre,   Globe-style.   The   conical   floor    was
encompassed by a circular  wall,  pierced here  and there by  openinJs of
different  si]es.  Some appeared to  be ventilation   shafts, some were  the
apertures of private boxes or technical control rooms, and by far the larJest
was a proscenium that occupied a  Tuarter of the  circumference, and that
was currently closed off by a curtain.

       Hackworth noted that the lowest and innermost part of the house floor
was not occupied. He motored down the slope and was shocked to reali]e
that he was suddenly up to his waist in painfully chilly  water. He threw the
chair into  reverse, but  it  did  not  respond to  the controls.  “Dead  in  the
water!” cried the Clown triumphantly, soundinJ as if he were standinJ riJht
there, thouJh Hackworth couldn't  see him. He found a  way to release the
chair's built-in restraints and struJJled up the raked floor, his leJs stiff from
the cold and reekinJ  of  seawater. Evidently the central  third of  the floor
actually plunJed beneath the waterline and was open to  the sea—another
fact that Hackworth's spectacles had not bothered to reveal.

475
       AJain,  do]ens of liJhts  were on him. The audience was lauJhinJ, and
there was even some sarcastic applause. Come on in, folks, the water's fine!
suJJested the spectacles, but once aJain Hackworth declined  to read the
line. Apparently  these were nothinJ more  than suJJestions tossed out by
Dramatis Personae's writers, which faded from the display as they lost their
currency.

       The   events of   the  last   few  minutes—the  phenomenoscopes that
couldn't be taken  off,  the unexpected bunJee Mump, the plunJe into cold
seawater—had left Hackworth in a state of shock. He felt a stronJ need to
hole up  somewhere and shake  off  the  disorientation. He  clambered up
toward the perimeter of  the house, dodJinJ  the occasional movinJ  chair,
and tracked by a few spotliJht  beams from fellow  audience members who
had taken a particular interest in his personal story. An aperture was above
him, JlowinJ   with  warm liJht,   and passinJ throuJh it,  Hackworth  found
himself in a co]y little  bar with a curvinJ window  that afforded an excellent
view of  the theatre. ,t was  a refuJe in  more ways than one; he could  see
normally  throuJh the  spectacles here, they seemed to be  JivinJ  him  an
untampered view of reality. He ordered a pint of stout from the barman and
took a seat at the counter alonJ the window. Somewhere around his third or
fourth  Julp  of  stout,  he  reali]ed  that  he  had already  submitted  to  the
Clown's imperative. The plunJe into  the water had tauJht him that  he had
no choice but to believe in what the spectacles showed his eyes and ears—
even thouJh he knew it to be false—and to accept the conseTuences. A pint
of  stout went  some  distance toward  warminJ  up  his  leJs,  and  toward
relaxinJ his mind.  He had come here for a show, and he was JettinJ  one,
and there was no reason to fiJht it; Dramatis Personae miJht have a dodJy
reputation, but no one had ever accused them of  killinJ  a member of  the
audience.

       The  chandeliers  dimmed.  The  torch-wieldinJ    audience went  into
motion like sparks stirred by a Just of wind, some motorinJ toward the hiJh
Jround and others preferrinJ the water's edJe. As the house liJhts faded to
black, they amused themselves playinJ their torches back and forth across
the walls and the curtain, creatinJ an apocalyptic  sky torn by  hundreds of
comets. A tonJue of clammy, alJae-colored liJht  shone beneath the water,

476
resolvinJ itself into a lonJ narrow thrust staJe as it rose toward the surface,
like Atlantis resurJent. The audience noticed it and bounced their spotliJhts
off the surface, catchinJ a few  dark motes in  the crossfire: the heads of a
do]en or so performers, slowly risinJ out of the water. They beJan to speak
in somethinJ like unison, and Hackworth reali]ed that they were the chorus
of lunatics he had seen earlier.

       “Set me up, Nick,”  said a woman's voice behind him.

       “Tucked 'em in, did you?” said the barkeep.

       “Ninnies.”

       Hackworth  turned and saw that it was the  younJ woman in  the devil
costume who had acted as tour Juide for  the Heartlanders. She was very
petite, dressed in a lonJ black skirt slit all  the way to the hipbone, and she
had nice hair, very thick and black and Jlossy. She carried a Jlass of wheat
beer over to the counter, primly  swept her devil's tail  out  of the way  in a
Jesture that Hackworth found hopelessly fetchinJ, and took a seat. Then she
let out  an explosive siJh  and put  her head down  on her  arms for  a few
moments, her blinkinJ red  horns reflectinJ in  the curved window  like  the
tailliJhts  of a  full-laner.  Hackworth laced his  finJers  toJether around his
pint and smelled her perfume. Down  below, the chorus had Jotten  out of
hand and was tryinJ to  pull  off  a rather ambitious Busby Berkeley  dance
number. They showed an uncanny ability to act in unison—somethinJ to do
with the  'sites that had burrowed into  their  brains—but their bodies were
stiff, weak,  and badly coordinated. What they  did, they did  with  absolute
conviction, which made it Jood anyway.

       “Did  they buy it?” Hackworth said.

       “Pardon me?” said the woman, lookinJ  up alertly like a bird,  as if she
hadn't known Hackworth was here.

       “Do   those Heartlanders really  believe that  story  about the  drunken
pilot?”

477
       “Oh.  Who cares?” the woman said.

       Hackworth  lauJhed, pleased that a member of Dramatis Personae was
affordinJ him this confidence.

       “,t's  off  the point, isn't it,”  the woman said in a lower  voice, JettinJ a
bit philosophical now. She sTuee]ed a wedJe of lemon into her wheat beer
and took a sip. “Belief   isn't a binary  state, not here at least. Does anyone
believe anythinJ one hundred percent? Do you believe everythinJ you see
throuJh those JoJJles?”

       “No,”   Hackworth said, “the only  thinJ ,  believe at the moment is that
my leJs are wet, this stout is Jood, and , like your perfume.”

       She looked a bit  surprised, not unpleasantly so, but she wasn't nearly
that easy. “So why are you here? Which show did you come to see?”

       “What  do you mean? , suppose , came to see this one.”

       “But  there is no this one. ,t's a whole family of shows. ,nterlaced.” She
parked her beer and executed Phase 1 of the here-is-the-church maneuver.
“Which show you see depends on which feed you're viewinJ.”

       “,  don't seem to have any control over what , see.”

       “Ah,  then you're a performer.”

       “So far ,  have felt like a very inept slapstick performer.”

       “,nept  slapstick? ,sn't that a bit redundant?”

       ,t  wasn't that funny,  but she said it  wittily,   and Hackworth chuckled
politely.

       “,t  sounds as thouJh you've been sinJled out to be a performer.”

       “You  don't say.”

478
       “Now,  , don't normally reveal our trade secrets,” the woman continued
in a lower voice, “but  usually when someone is sinJled out as a performer,
it's because they have come here for some purpose other than pure, passive
entertainment.”

       Hackworth  stuttered and fumbled for words a bit. “Does  that—is that
done?”

       “Oh,  yes!” the woman said. She rose from her stool and moved to the
one riJht  next to  Hackworth.  “Theatre's not  Must a few people clowninJ
about on a staJe, beinJ watched by this herd of oxen. , mean, sometimes it's
that. But   it  can  be ever  so  much  more—really  it  can  be  any  sort  of
interaction between people and people, or  people and  information.”  The
woman had  become Tuite passionate now, forJotten  herself  completely.
Hackworth Jot boundless pleasure Must from watchinJ her. When she'd first
entered the bar, he'd thouJht she had a sort of nondescript face, but as she
let her Juard down and spoke without  any self-consciousness, she seemed
to become prettier and prettier. “We are tied in to everythinJ here—pluJJed
into the whole universe of information. Really, it's a virtual  theatre. ,nstead
of beinJ hardwired, the staJe, sets, cast, and script are all soft—they can be
reconfiJured simply by shiftinJ bits about.”

       “Oh.  So the show—or interlaced set of shows—can be different each
niJht?”

       “No,  you're still  not JettinJ  it,”  she said, becominJ very excited. She
reached out and  Jripped  his  forearm  Must below the elbow  and  leaned
toward him, desperate to make sure he Jot this. “,t's  not  that we do  a set
show, reconfiJure, and a different one next niJht. The chanJes are dynamic
and take  place in   real  time.  The  show reconfiJures  itself   dynamically
dependinJ upon what happens moment to moment—and mind you, not Must
what happens here, but what is happeninJ in the world at larJe. ,t is a smart
play—an intelliJent orJanism.”

       “So,  if, for  example, a battle between the Fists of RiJhteous Harmony
and the Coastal Republic were takinJ place in the interior  of China at this

479
moment, then shifts in the battle miJht in some way—”

       “MiJht   chanJe  the color  of  a  spotliJht  or  a  line  of  dialoJue—not
necessarily in any simple and deterministic fashion, mind you—”

       “,  think  , understand,” Hackworth said. “The  internal variables of the
play depend on the total universe of information outside—”

       The woman nodded viJorously, Tuite pleased with him, her huJe black
eyes shininJ.

       Hackworth  continued, “As,  for  example, a person's state of  mind at
any  Jiven   moment  miJht   depend  on   the  relative   concentrations  of
innumerable chemical compounds circulatinJ throuJh his bloodstream.”

       “Yes,”  the woman said, “like  if  you're in a pub beinJ chatted up by  a
fetchinJ younJ Jentleman, the words cominJ out of your mouth are affected
by the amount of  alcohol you've put  into your  system, and, of course, by
concentrations of natural hormones—aJain, not  in a  simple deterministic
way—these thinJs are all inputs.”

       “,  think ,'m  beJinninJ to Jet your meaninJ,” Hackworth said.

       “Substitute  toniJht's show for  the brain, and the  information flowinJ
across the net for molecules flowinJ throuJh the bloodstream, and you have
it,” the woman said.

       Hackworth  was a  bit disappointed that  she had chosen to pull  back
from the pub metaphor, which he had found more immediately interestinJ.

       The  woman  continued, “That  lack  of   determinism causes some to
dismiss the  whole   process as wankinJ.   But  in   fact  it's  an  incredibly
powerful tool. Some people understand that.”

       “,  believe  , do,”  Hackworth  said, desperately wantinJ her to  believe
that he did.

480
       “And  so some people come here because they are on a Tuest of some
sort—tryinJ to  find  a lost lover, let's say, or to understand why somethinJ
terrible happened in their lives, or why there is cruelty in the world, or why
they aren't  satisfied  with  their  career. Society  has never  been Jood  at
answerinJ these Tuestions—the sorts of Tuestions you can't Must look up in a
reference database.”

       “But  the dynamic theatre allows one to interface with  the universe of
data in a more intuitive way,” Hackworth said.

       “That  is precisely  it,”  the  woman said. “,'m  so  pleased that you Jet
this.”

       “When  , was workinJ  with  information,  it freTuently occurred to me,
in  a  vaJue  and  Jeneral  way,  that  such  a  thinJ  miJht   be  desirable,”
Hackworth said. “But this is beyond my imaJination.”

       “Where did you hear of us?”

       “,  was referred here by a friend  who has been associated with you in
the past, in some vaJue way.”

       “Oh?  May ,  ask who? Perhaps we have a mutual friend,” the woman
said, as if that would be a fine thinJ.

       Hackworth  felt   himself  reddeninJ and  let  out  a  deep breath. “All
riJht,”  he said, “,  lied. ,t  wasn't really  a friend of  mine. ,t  was someone ,
was led to.”

       “Ah,  now  we're JettinJ  into  it,”  the woman said.  “,  knew there was
somethinJ mysterious JoinJ on with you.”

       Hackworth was abashed and did not know what to say. He looked into
his beer. The woman was starinJ at him, and he could feel her eyes on his
face like the warmth of a follow spot.

481
        “So  you did  come here in  search of somethinJ.  Didn't   you? SomethinJ
you couldn't  find  by lookinJ   it up in  a database.”

        “,'m  seekinJ  a fellow  called  the Alchemist,”   Hackworth  said.

        Suddenly,  thinJs   Jot  briJht.   The  side  of  the  woman's  face  that  was
toward the  window   was brilliantly    illuminated,   like  a probe  in  space lit  on
one side by  the  directional   liJht   of  the sun.  Hackworth   sensed, somehow,
that this was not  a new development.  LookinJ  out  over the audience,  he saw
that nearly   all  of  them  were  aiminJ  their   spotliJhts  into   the bar,  and that
everyone  in   the   place   had  been  watchinJ    and   listeninJ   to   his   entire
conversation   with    the   woman.   The   spectacles   had   deceived   him   by
adMustinJ the apparent  liJht   levels.  The  woman   looked  different   too;  her
face had  reverted to  the  way  it  looked  when  she came  in, and  Hackworth
now   understood  that   her   imaJe   in   his  spectacles   had  been   Jradually
evolvinJ  durinJ   their  conversation,  JettinJ  feedback  from  whatever  part  of
his brain bu]]ed   when  he saw a beautiful  woman.

        The curtain   parted to  reveal  a larJe  electric  siJn  descendinJ  from  the
fly   space:  -OHN   HACKWORTH      in  48EST     FOR   THE   ALCHEM,ST
starrinJ -OHN   HACKWORTH    as H,MSELF.

        The Chorus  sanJ:

 

      He's such a stiff, John Hackworth is
      Can't show emotion to save his life 
      With nasty repercussions, viz 
      He lost his Mob and lost his wife. 
      So now he's on a goshdarn Quest 
      Wandering all o'er the world 
      Hunting down that Alchemist 
      'Cept when he stops to pick up girls. 
      Maybe he'll clean up his act 
      And do the Mob tonight 
      A fabulous adventure packed 
      With marvelous sounds and sights 
      Let's get it on, oh Hacker John 
      Let's get it on, on, on. 

482
 

        SomethinJ   Merked violently    at  Hackworth's   neck.   The  woman   had
tossed a noose around him while  he'd  been starinJ out  the window,  and now
she was haulinJ  him  out the door  of  the bar like  a recalcitrant  doJ.  As soon
as she cleared  the doorway,   her cape  inflated  like   a time-lapse  explosion,
and she shot twelve   feet into   the air,  propelled  on  Mets of air built  into  her
clothinJ   somehow—she   payed  out   the  leash  so   that  Hackworth    wasn't
hanJed in  the process. FlyinJ   above the audience  like  the cone of  fire  from
a rocket  enJine,  she led  the  stumblinJ   Hackworth   down  the  slopinJ  floor
and to the edJe of  the water.  The thrust  staJe was linked  to the water's  edJe
by  a couple   of  narrow   bridJes,  and  Hackworth   neJotiated   one  of  these,
feelinJ  hundreds of  liJhts  on  his shoulders,  seeminJly  hot  enouJh  to iJnite
his clothinJ.   She  led  him  straiJht  back  throuJh   the  center of  the  Chorus,
beneath  the   electric   siJn,   throuJh    the  backstaJe   area,  and   throuJh   a
doorway, which  clanJed  shut behind him.  Then  she vanished.

        Hackworth   was   surrounded  on   three  sides  by   softly   JlowinJ    blue
walls.  He  reached  out   to  touch   one  and  received  a  mild   shock   for  his
troubles. SteppinJ   forward,  he tripped  over  somethinJ  that  skittered  across
the floor:  a dry bone, biJ  and heavy, larJer  than a human femur.

        He  stepped forward  throuJh   the only   Jap available  to  him  and  found
more walls.  He had been deposited into  the heart of  a labyrinth.

        ,t  took him  an  hour or  so to reali]e   that escape throuJh  normal  means
was hopeless.  He  didn't  even  try   to  fiJure  out   the labyrinth's   floor   plan;
instead,  reali]inJ    that   it   couldn't   possibly    be  larJer   than  the   ship,   he
followed  the  foolproof   expedient  of turninJ   riJht  at  every corner,  which  as
all clever  boys  knew  must  always  lead to  an exit.  But  it  didn't,  and he  did
not  understand  why  until   once,  in  the  corner   of  his  eye,  he  saw  a wall
seJment shift   sideways,  closinJ  up  an old  Jap  and  creatinJ  a new  one.  ,t
was a dynamic labyrinth.

        He found  a rusty  bolt  on the  floor,  picked  it up,  and threw  it  at a wall.
,t did  not bounce off  but passed throuJh  and clattered onto  the floor  beyond.

483
So the walls did not exist except as fiJments in his spectacles. The labyrinth
was constructed of information. ,n order to  escape, he would have to hack
it.

       He   sat  down  on  the  floor.   Nick   the  barman  appeared, walkinJ
unhindered throuJh  walls,  bearinJ a  tray  with  another  stout on  it,  and
handed it to him alonJ  with a bowl  of  salty peanuts. As the eveninJ went
on, other people passed throuJh his area, dancinJ or sinJinJ or duelinJ or
arJuinJ or makinJ love. None of these had anythinJ to do, particularly, with
Hackworth's 4uest,  and they  appeared to have nothinJ  to  do  with  each
other. Apparently Hackworth's 4uest was (as the devil-woman  herself had
told him)  Must one of several concurrent stories  beinJ acted out  toniJht,
coexistinJ in the same space.

       So what did  any of  this have to do with  the life  of  -ohn Hackworth?
And how was Fiona mixed up in it?

       As Hackworth  thouJht about Fiona, a panel in front of  him slid to the
side, exposinJ several yards of corridor. DurinJ the next couple of hours he
noted the same thinJ several times: An idea would occur to him, and a wall
would move.

       ,n  this way he moved in fits  and starts throuJh the ma]e, as his mind
moved  from  one  idea  to   the  next.  The  floor   was  definitely   slopinJ
downward, which would obviously  brinJ  him below the waterline at  some
point; and indeed he had beJun to sense a heavy drumminJ noise cominJ
up throuJh the deckplates, which miJht have been the poundinJ of miJhty
enJines except that this ship, as far as he knew, wasn't JoinJ anywhere. He
smelled seawater before him and saw dim liJhts shininJ throuJh its surface,
broken by the waves, and knew that in the flooded ballast tanks of this ship
lay  a  network  of   underwater tunnels,  and  that  in  those  tunnels  were
Drummers. For  all  he knew,  the whole  show  was Must a fiJment  beinJ
enacted in the mind of the Drummers. Probably not the main event either; it
was probably  Must an epiphenomenon of   whatever  deep processes the
Drummers were runninJ down there in their collective mind.

484
       A   wall  panel  slid  aside and  Jave  him  a  clear  path to  the  water.
Hackworth sTuatted at the water's edJe for a few minutes, listeninJ  to the
drums, then stood up and beJan to undo his necktie.

         

He was terribly hot and sweaty, and briJht liJht was in his eyes, and none of
these thinJs were  consistent with  beinJ  underwater. He awoke  to see a
briJht blue sky  overhead, pawed at his face, and found that the spectacles
were Jone. Fiona was there in her white dress, watchinJ him with a rueful
smile. The floor  was  poundinJ Hackworth  on the buttocks  and evidently
had been for some time, as the bony parts of his backside were bruised and
raw. He reali]ed that they were on the raft, headinJ back toward the London
docks; that he was naked and that Fiona had covered him with  a sheet of
plastic to  protect his  skin  from  the  sun. A  few  other  theaterJoers were
scattered about, slumped aJainst one another, utterly passive, like refuJees,
or people who've Must had the Jreatest sex of their lives, or people who are
tremendously hunJ over.

       “You   were   Tuite  a   hit,”   Fiona   said.  And   suddenly  Hackworth
remembered himself beinJ  paraded naked and drippinJ  down  the  thrust
staJe, waves of applause rollinJ over him from the standinJ audience.

       “The 4uest  is finished,” he blurted. “We're JoinJ to ShanJhai.”

       “You're  JoinJ  to ShanJhai,” Fiona said. “,'ll   see you off  at the dock.
Then ,'ll be JoinJ back.” She cocked her head over the stern.

       “Back  to the ship?”

       “,  was a biJJer hit than you were,”  she said. “,'ve found my callinJ in
life, Father. ,'ve accepted an invitation to Moin Dramatis Personae.”


                                        Carl Hollywood's  hack.

485
Carl Hollywood  leaned back aJainst the hard lacTuered back of his corner
seat for the first time  in many hours and rubbed his face with  both hands,
scratchinJ himself  with   his  own  whiskers.  He  had  been sittinJ  in   the
teahouse for almost twenty-four  hours, consumed twelve pots of  tea, and
twice called in masseuses to unknot his back. The afternoon liJht cominJ in
the windows behind him flickered  as the crowd outside beJan to break up.
They had been treated to a remarkable free media show, watchinJ over his
shoulders for    hours  as  the   dramaturJical  exploits   of   -ohn   Percival
Hackworth had played themselves out, in several different  camera anJles,
on floatinJ cine windows  on Carl Hollywood's  paJes. None of them could
read EnJlish, and so they had been unable to follow  the story of  Princess
Nell's adventures in the  land of  KinJ  Coyote, which  had been streaminJ
across the paJes at the same time, the storyline fluctuatinJ and curlinJ  in
upon itself like a cloud of smoke spun and torn by invisible currents.

       Now  the paJes were blank and empty. Carl reached out la]ily with one
hand and beJan to stack the sheets on top of each other, Must for somethinJ
to occupy his hands while his mind  worked—thouJh it  wasn't workinJ,  at
this point, so much as stumblinJ blindly  throuJh a dark labyrinth à la -ohn
Percival Hackworth.

       Carl  Hollywood   had  lonJ  suspected that, amonJ  other  thinJs,  the
network of  the  Drummers  was a  Jiant  system for  breakinJ  codes. The
cryptoJraphic systems that made the media network run securely, and that
made it capable of securely transferrinJ money, were based on the use of
immense prime numbers as maJic  keys. The keys  could theoretically  be
broken by throwinJ  enouJh computinJ  power at the  problem. But  at any
Jiven level of computinJ power, code-makinJ was always much easier than
code-breakinJ, so as lonJ as the system kept movinJ  to  larJer and larJer
prime numbers as  computers Jot  faster, the code-makers could  stay far
ahead of the code-breakers forever.

       But  the  human mind  didn't  work   like  a  diJital  computer  and was
capable of doinJ some funny  thinJs. Carl  Hollywood  remembered one of
the Lone EaJles, an older man who could add huJe columns of numbers in
his head as Tuickly  as they  were called  out.  That, in  and of  itself,  was

486
merely a duplication of somethinJ that a diJital computer could do. But this
man could also do  numerical tricks  that could not  easily be proJrammed
into a computer.

       ,f    many  minds   were  Jathered  toJether   in   the  network   of   the
Drummers,  perhaps  they  could   somehow  see  throuJh   the  storm   of
encrypted data that roared  continuously throuJh  media  space, cause the
seeminJly random bits to coalesce into meaninJ. The men who had come to
talk  to   Miranda,  who   had  persuaded her  to   enter the   world  of   the
Drummers, had implied that this was possible; that throuJh them, Miranda
could find Nell.

       Superficially,  this  would be  disastrous, because it would destroy the
system used for financial transactions. ,t would be as if,  in  a world where
commerce was based upon the exchanJe of Jold, some person had fiJured
out how to chanJe lead into Jold. An Alchemist.

       But  Carl  Hollywood   wondered if   it  really  made a  difference.  The
Drummers could  only  do  such  thinJs  by  subsuminJ themselves into   a
Jestalt society.  As  the  case of  Hackworth  demonstrated, as  soon as  a
Drummer  removed  himself   from   that  Jestalt,   he  lost   touch  with   it
completely. All  communication between the Drummers and normal human
society took place unconsciously, throuJh their influence upon  the Net, in
patterns that appeared subliminally in the ractives that everyone played with
in  their   homes and   saw  playinJ  across  the  walls   of   buildinJs.  The
Drummers could break the code, but they couldn't take advantaJe of it in an
obvious way, or  perhaps they simply  did  not want  to.  They could  make
Jold, but they were no lonJer interested in havinJ it.

       -ohn Hackworth,  somehow, was better than anyone else at makinJ the
transition between the society  of  Drummers and the  Victorian  tribe, and
each time he crossed the boundary, he seemed to brinJ somethinJ with him,
clinJinJ to his Jarments like traces of scent. These faint echoes of forbidden
data entrained in his wake caused tanJled and unpredictable repercussions,
on both sides of the boundary, that Hackworth  himself miJht  not even be
aware of.  Carl  Hollywood  had  known  little  of  Hackworth   until  several

487
hours aJo, when, alerted by a friend in Dramatis Personae, he had Moined his
story in proJress on the black decks of  the show boat. Now  he seemed to
know a Jreat deal: that Hackworth was the proJenitor of  the Young Lady's
Illustrated Primer, and that he had a deep relationship with  the Drummers
that went far beyond anythinJ as simpleminded as captivity. He had not Must
been eatinJ lotuses and JettinJ his rocks off  durinJ  his years beneath the
waves.

       Hackworth  had brouJht somethinJ back with  him this  time, when he
had emerJed naked and streaminJ with cold seawater from the  warren of
Drummers in the ballast  tanks of the  ship. He had emerJed with  a set of
numerical keys that were used to identify certain entities: the Primer, Nell,
Miranda, and someone else who went by the name of Dr. ;. Before he had
fully reentered his conscious state, he had supplied those keys to the Clown,
who had been there to haul his JaspinJ and shiverinJ body out of the water.
The Clown was a mechanical device, but Dramatis Personae had been Jood
enouJh to allow Carl  Hollywood  to control  it—and to  improvise much of
Hackworth's personal script and storyline—for the duration of the show.

       Now   Carl  had  the  keys  and,  for   the  purposes of   the  Net,  was
indistinJuishable  from  Miranda   or  Nell  or   Dr.  ;    or  even  Hackworth
himself. They were written  out across the surface of a paJe, lonJ columns
of diJits Jrouped in bunches of four. Carl Hollywood  told this sheet to fold
itself  and then  tucked it   into  his  breast pocket.  He could  use  them to
untanJle this whole business, but that would be another niJht's hack. Snuff
and caffeine had done as much as they could. ,t was time to Jo back to the
hotel, soak in a bath, Jet some sleep, and prepare for the final act.


                  From  the Primer, Princess Nell's ride to the Castle
                       of  King Coyote; description of the castle; an 
                     audience with a Wizard; her final  triumph  over 
                                King Coyote; an enchanted army.

       At  tKLs tKe  otKer  messenJers    made   no  eIIort   to  controO tKeLr

       PrLncess  NeOO waOked down tKe aLsOe toward KLnJ Coyote.  He

       “Very  Iunny,”  Ke  saLd. “You  snuck  a  zero  dLvLde Sast aOO oI my

       “And  Lt Ls aOso a TurLnJ macKLne, tKen? AOO controOOed by WLzard

       “OSen  tKe  aOtar,” saLd KLnJ Coyote,   SoLntLnJ to a   OarJe brass

       PrLncess  NeOO used Ker key to oSen  tKe Oock, and KLnJ Coyote
IOLSSed back tKe OLd oI tKe aOtar. InsLde were two smaOO macKLnes, one

       “FoOOow me,” saLd KLnJ Coyote, and oSened  a  traSdoor  set  Lnto

       PrLncess NeOO IoOOowed KLm down a sSLraO staLrcase Lnto a smaOO

       “WLzard  Ls not  even   connected   to  tKe  aOtar! It  does  notKLnJ,”

       KLnJ Coyote   Oed PrLncess NeOO back Lnto tKe Keart oI KLs keeS

       Nell  stopped readinJ the Primer for a moment. Her eyes had filled up
with tears.

       “,s  there what?” said -ohn's voice from the book.

       “,s  there another? Another who has been with me durinJ my Tuest?”

       “Yes, there is,”  -ohn said Tuietly, after a short pause. “At  least , have

       “,s  she here now?”

       “Only  if  you  build a  place for her,”  -ohn said. “Read the books, and

oI tKe OLbrary:

 

                                      WE ARE  ENCHANTED
                                    RE48EST    ASSISTANCE 
                                         REFER  TO BOOKS 

 

       “,   shall bend  all  my  efforts toward  your  disenchantment,” Princess
Nell said, and a tremendous, earsplittinJ scream of Jratitude rose from the
tiny throats of the Mouse Army.

       FindinJ  the reTuired book  did not  take lonJ. The  Mouse Army  split
itself up into  small  detachments, each of which wrestled a different  book
from the shelf, opened it up on the floor, and scampered throuJh it one paJe
at a time, lookinJ  for relevant spells. Within  the hour, Princess Nell noted
that a broad open corridor had  developed in the Mouse Army,  and that a
book was makinJ  its way toward  her, seeminJ to float  an inch above the
floor.

       She lifted  the  book carefully  from  the backs of  the mice  who  were
bearinJ  it   and   flipped   throuJh   it   until   she  found   a   spell  for   the
disenchantment of mice. “Very well  then,” she said, and beJan to read the
spell; but suddenly, excited sTueakinJ filled  the air and all  the mice were
runninJ away  in  a panic.  The Generalissima climbed  up  onto the  paJe,
MumpinJ up and down  in  a  state of   extreme aJitation  and  wavinJ  her
foreleJs back and forth over her head.

       “Ah,   , understand,” Princess Nell  said. She picked up  the book  and
walked out of the library, takinJ care not to step on any of her subMects, and
followed them out to the vast empty space beyond.

       Once aJain the Mouse Army  put on a da]]linJ   display of  close-order
drill,  drawinJ   itself  up  across  the  empty, colorless  plain  by   platoons,

504
companies, battalions, reJiments, and briJades;  but this  time  the parade
took up a much larJer space, because this time the mice took care to space
themselves as far apart as the lenJth of a human arm. Some of the platoons
had to march what was, for  them, a distance of  many leaJues in order to
reach the edJes of the formation. Princess Nell took advantaJe of the time
to wander about and inspect the ranks, and to rehearse the spell.

       Finally  the Generalissima approached, bowed deeply, and Jave her the
thumbs-up, thouJh Princess Nell had to pick the tiny leader up and sTuint to
see this Jesture.

       She went  to the  place that had  been left  for  her at the  head of  the
formation, opened up the book, and spoke the maJic spell.

       There  was a violent   thunderclap, and a  rush of  wind  that  knocked
Princess Nell flat  on her back. She looked up, da]ed,  to see that she was
surrounded by a vast army of some hundreds of thousands of Jirls, only a
few years younJer than she was. A wild cheer rose up, and all of  the Jirls
fell to  their knees as one and, in a scene of riotous Mubilation, proclaimed
their fealty to 4ueen Nell.


                   Hackworth  in China;  depredations of the Fists; a
                        meeting with Dr. X;  an unusual procession. 



They said that the Chinese had Jreat respect for madmen, and that durinJ
the days of  the  Boxer Rebellion,  certain Western missionaries, probably
unstable characters to beJin with,  who had been trapped behind walls  of
rubble for weeks, scurryinJ throuJh the sniper fire of the encirclinJ  Boxers
and ,mperial troops and listeninJ to the cries of their flock beinJ burned and
tortured in  the streets of  BeiMinJ, had become deranJed and had walked
unharmed into the ranks of their besieJers and been Jiven food and treated
with deference.

       Now  -ohn Percival Hackworth, havinJ checked into a suite on the top
floor of  the ShanJri-La  in  PudonJ (or ShonJ-a-lee-lah as the taxi-drivers

505
sanJ it), put on a fresh shirt; his best waistcoat, Jirded with the Jold chain,
adanJle with his chop, snuffboxes, fob, and watchphone; a lonJ coat with a
swallowtail for  ridinJ;  boots, the black leather and brass spurs hand-shined
in the lobby of  the ShonJ-a-lee-lah by a coolie who was so servile that he
was insolent, and Hackworth suspected him of beinJ a Fist; new kid Jloves;
and his bowler, de-mossed and otherwise spruced up a bit, but obviously a
veteran of many travels in rouJh territory.

       As  he crossed the western bank of the HuanJ Pu, the usual crowd of
starvinJ peasants and professional  amputees washed around him  like  a
wave runninJ up a flat beach because, thouJh ridinJ here was danJerous, it
was not cra]y, and they did not know  him for a madman. He kept his Jray
eyes fixed  upon  the  picket  of  burninJ  Feed  lines  that  demarcated the
shrinkinJ  border of  the Coastal  Republic, and let  their  hands tuJ  at his
coattails, but he took no notice of them. At different  times, three very rural
younJ men, identifiable  as much by  their deep tans as their iJnorance of
modern security technoloJy, made the  mistake of  reachinJ for  his watch
chain and received warninJ shocks for their trouble. One of them refused to
let Jo until the smell of burned flesh rose from his palm, and then he peeled
his hand away slowly and calmly, starinJ up at Hackworth to  show that he
didn't mind a little pain, and said somethinJ clearly and loudly that caused a
titter to run throuJh the crowd.

       The ride down NanMinJ Road took him throuJh the heart of ShanJhai's
shoppinJ district, now  an endless Jauntlet of tanned beJJars sTuattinJ on
their heels JrippinJ  the  briJhtly  colored  plastic baJs that  served as their
suitcases, carefully passinJ the butts  of ciJarettes back  and forth.  ,n  the
shop windows above their heads, animated mannikins strutted and posed in
the latest Coastal Republic styles. Hackworth noticed that these were much
more conservative than they had  been ten years aJo, durinJ  his  last trip
down NanMinJ Road. The  female  mannikins  weren't wearinJ   slit  skirts
anymore. Many weren't wearinJ skirts at all, but silk  pants instead, or lonJ
robes that were  even  less revealinJ.  One display  was  centered upon  a
patriarchal fiJure who reclined on a dais, wearinJ  a round cap with a blue
button on the top: a mandarin. A younJ scholar was bowinJ to him. Around

506
the dais, four Jroups of mannikins were demonstratinJ the other four filial
relationships.

       So it was chic to be Confucian now, or at least it was politic. This was
one of the  few shop windows  that didn't  have red Fist  posters pasted all
over it.

       Hackworth  rode  past marble  villas  built  by  ,raTi  -ews  in  previous
centuries, past the hotel where Nixon  had once stayed, past the hiJh-rise
enclaves that Western businessmen had used as the beachheads of the post-
Communist development that had led to the sTualid affluence of the Coastal
Republic. He rode past niJhtclubs the si]e  of stadiums; Mai-alai pits where
stunned refuJees Japed at the MostlinJ of the bettors; side streets filled with
boutiTues, one street for fine Joods made from alliJators, another for furs,
another for leathers; a nanotech district  consistinJ of  tiny  businesses that
did bespoke enJineerinJ;  fruit  and  veJetable stands; a cul-de-sac where
peddlers sold antiTues from little carts, one speciali]inJ in  cinnabar boxes,
another in  Maoist  kitsch. Each  time  the density  beJan to  wane and  he
thouJht he must be reachinJ the edJe of the city, he would come to another
edJe city of miniature three-story strip malls and it would beJin aJain.

       But  as the day went on, he truly did approach the limit of the city  and
kept ridinJ anyway toward the west, and it became evident then that he was
a madman and the people in the streets looked at him with awe and Jot out
of his  way.  Bicycles and  pedestrians became less common, replaced by
heavier and faster military   traffic.  Hackworth  did  not  like  ridinJ  on  the
shoulder of hiJhways,  and so he directed Kidnapper  to find  a  less direct
route to Su]hou, one that used smaller roads. This was flat  YanJt]e  Delta
territory  only   inches above  the  waterline,  where  canals, for   transport,
irriJation,  and  drainaJe,  were  more  numerous than  roads.  The  canals
ramified throuJh the black, stinky Jround like  blood vessels branchinJ into
the tissues of  the  brain.  The plain  was  interrupted  freTuently by  small
tumuli containinJ  the coffins  of  someone's ancestors, Must hiJh enouJh to
stay above the most routine floods. Farther to the west, steep hills rose from
the paddies, black with veJetation. The Coastal Republic checkpoints at the
intersections of the roads were Jray and fu]]y, like house-si]e clots of bread

507
mold, so dense was the fractal defense Jrid, and starinJ throuJh the cloud of
macro- and microscopic aerostats, Hackworth could  barely make  out the
hoplites in the  center, heat waves risinJ from  the radiators on their backs
and stirrinJ the airborne soup. They let him pass throuJh without incident.
Hackworth expected to see more checkpoints as he continued toward Fist
territory, but the first one was the last; the Coastal Republic did not have the
strenJth for  defense in  depth and  could  muster only  a  one-dimensional
picket line.

       A  mile  past the checkpoint, at another small intersection, Hackworth
found  a  pair  of  very   makeshift  crucifixes  fashioned  from  freshly   cut
mulberry trees, Jreen leaves still   flutterinJ  from  their  twiJs.  Two younJ
white men had been bound to the crucifixes with Jray plastic ties, burned in
many places  and incrementally   disembowled. From  the  looks  of   their
haircuts and the somber black neckties that had been ironically left around
their  necks, Hackworth  Juessed they  were  Mormons.  A  lonJ  skein  of
intestine trailed from one of their  bellies down into the dirt,  where a Jaunt
piJ was tuJJinJ on it stubbornly.

       He did  not see much more death, but he smelled it everywhere in the
hot wet  air. He  thouJht  that he  miJht  be seeinJ a  network  of  nanotech
defense barriers until he reali]ed  that it  was a natural phenomenon: Each
waterway supported a linear black nimbus of fat, drowsy flies. From this he
knew that if he tuJJed a bit on this or that rein and Juided Kidnapper to the
bank of the canal, he would find it filled with ballooninJ corpses.

       Ten minutes  after passinJ the  Coastal Republic checkpoint, he  rode
throuJh the center of a Fist encampment. As he looked neither riJht nor left,
he could not really  estimate its si]e;  they had taken over a villaJe  of  low
brick-and-stucco buildinJs. A lonJ straiJht smudJe runninJ across the earth
marked the location of a burned Feed line, and as he crossed it, Hackworth
fantasi]ed that it was a meridian  enJraved on the livinJ Jlobe  by an astral
cartoJrapher. Most  of  the Fists  were  shirtless, wearinJ  indiJo   trousers,
scarlet Jirdles knotted  at the waist,  sometimes scarlet ribbons tied  round
necks, foreheads, or upper arms. The ones who weren't sleepinJ or smokinJ
were practicinJ  martial arts. Hackworth  rode slowly   throuJh their  midst,

508
and they  pretended not  to  notice  him,  except  for  one  man who  came
runninJ out of  a house with  a knife, shoutinJ  “Sha!  Sha!”  and had to be
tackled by three comrades.

       As  he  rode the  forty  miles  to  Su]hou,  nothinJ  chanJed  about the
landscape except that creeks became rivers and ponds became lakes. The
Fist encampments became somewhat larJer and closer toJether. When the
thick air infreTuently  roused itself to a bree]e, he could  smell the clammy
metallic reek of staJnant water and knew he was close to the Jreat lake of
Tai Wu, or Taifu as the ShanJhainese pronounced it. A Jrayscale dome rose
from  the paddies some  miles away,  castinJ a  film   of  shadow before  a
cluster of tall  buildinJs,  and Hackworth  knew  it must  be Su]hou,  now a
stronJhold of  the Celestial  KinJdom,  veiled  in  its airborne  shield like  a
courtesan behind a translucent sheen of Su]hou silk.

       NearinJ the shore of the Jreat lake he found his way onto an important
road that ran south toward HanJ]hou. He set Kidnapper amblinJ northward.
Su]hou had thrown out tendrils of  development alonJ its maMor roads, and
so as he drew  closer he  saw strip  malls  and franchises, now  destroyed,
deserted, or coloni]ed  by refuJees. Most  of these places catered to truck
drivers: lots  of  motels, casinos, teahouses, and fast-food  places. But  no
trucks ran on the hiJhway now, and Hackworth  rode down the center of a
lane, sweatinJ uncontrollably  in  his dark  clothes and drinkinJ  freTuently
from a refriJerated bottle in Kidnapper's Jlove compartment.

       A   McDonald's  siJn   lay  toppled  across the  hiJhway   like   a  Jiant
turnpike; somethinJ had burned throuJh the sinJle pillar  that thrust it  into
the air.  A  couple  of  younJ  men  were  standinJ in  front   of  it  smokinJ
ciJarettes and, as Hackworth reali]ed, waitinJ for him. As Hackworth drew
closer, they  Jround  out   their  ciJarettes,  stepped forward,  and  bowed.
Hackworth tipped his  bowler. One of  them took Kidnapper's reins,  which
was a purely ceremonial Jesture in the case of a robot horse, and the other
invited Hackworth  to dismount. Both  of the men  were wearinJ heavy but
flexible  coveralls with   cables and tubes runninJ  throuJh  the  fabric:  the
inner layer  of  armor suits.  They could  turn  themselves into battle-ready
hoplites by  slappinJ  on  the  harder and  heavier outer  bits,  which  were

509
presumably stashed somewhere handy. Their scarlet headbands identified
them as Fists. Hackworth was one of the few members of the Outer Tribes
ever to find himself  in the presence of a Fist who was not  runninJ toward
him with  a weapon screaminJ “Kill!   Kill!”   and found it  interestinJ to  see
them  in   a  more  indulJent   mood.  They   were  diJnified,   formal,   and
controlled, like  military  men, with  none of the leerinJ  and snickerinJ that
were fashionable amonJ Coastal Republic boys of the same aJe.

       Hackworth  walked  across the  parkinJ  lot   toward  the McDonald's,
followed  at a respectful  distance by one of  the  soldiers. Another  soldier
opened the door for him, and Hackworth siJhed with deliJht as cold dry air
flowed over his face and beJan to chase the muJJy stuff throuJh the weave
of his clothinJ.  The place had been liJhtly  sacked. He could smell a cold,
almost  clinical  Jreasy  smell   waftinJ   from  behind  the  counter,  where
containers of fat had spilled onto the floor  and conJealed like snow. Much
of this  had been scooped up by looters; Hackworth could  see the parallel
tracks of women's finJers. The  place was decorated in a Silk Road motif,
transpicuous mediatronic panels portrayinJ wondrous siJhts between here
and the route's ancient terminus in Cadi].

       Dr. ;   was seated in the corner booth, his face radiant in the cool, 8V-
filtered sunliJht. He was wearinJ a mandarin cap with draJons embroidered
in Jold  thread and a maJnificent brocade robe. The robe was loose at the
neck and had short sleeves so that Hackworth could see the inner Jarment
of a hoplite  suit underneath. Dr. ;   was at war, and had emerJed from the
safe perimeter of Su]hou, and needed to be prepared for an attack. He was
sippinJ Jreen tea from  a Mumbo McDonald's cup, made in the local style,
Jreat clouds of biJ Jreen leaves swirlinJ  around in a tumbler of hot  water.
Hackworth doffed  his  hat and  bowed in  the  Victorian  style, which  was
proper under the circumstances. Dr. ;   returned the bow,  and as his head
tilted forward, Hackworth could see the button on the top of his cap. ,t was
red, the color of the hiJhest ranks, but it was made of coral, markinJ him as
second rank. A ruby button would have put him at the very hiJhest level. ,n
Western terms this  made  Dr.  ;    rouJhly  eTuivalent to  a  lesser cabinet
minister or three-star Jeneral. Hackworth supposed that this was the hiJhest
rank of mandarin permitted to converse with barbarians.

510
       Hackworth  sat down  across the table from  Dr.  ;.   A  younJ  woman
padded out of  the kitchen  on silk  slippers and  Jave Hackworth  his own
tumbler full  of  Jreen tea. WatchinJ her mince away, Hackworth was only
mildly  shocked to see that her  feet were no  more than four  inches lonJ.
There must be better ways to do it now, maybe by reJulatinJ the Jrowth of
the tarsal bones durinJ adolescence. ,t probably didn't even hurt.

       Reali]inJ  this,  Hackworth also reali]ed,  for the first  time, that he had
done the riJht thinJ ten years aJo.

       Dr.  ;    was watchinJ  him  and miJht  as well   have been readinJ his
mind. This  seemed to put him  in a  pensive mood. He said nothinJ  for  a
while, Must Ja]ed out the window and occasionally sipped his tea. This was
fine with Hackworth, who had had a lonJ ride.

       “Have  you  learned  anythinJ  from  your  ten-year  sentence?” Dr.  ;
finally said.

       “,t  would seem so. But , have trouble pullinJ it up,” Hackworth said.

       This  was  a  bit  too  idiomatic   for  Dr.   ;.   By   way  of  explanation,
Hackworth flipped  out a ten-year-old card bearinJ  Dr. ;'s   dynamic chop.
As the old fisherman hauled the draJon out of the water, Dr. ; suddenly Jot
it,  and  Jrinned  appreciatively.  This   was  showinJ  a  lot   of  emotion—
assuminJ it was Jenuine—but aJe and war had made him reckless.

       “Have you found the Alchemist?” Dr. ;   said.

       “Yes,”  Hackworth said. “, am the Alchemist.”

       “When did  you know this?”

       “Only  very  recently,” Hackworth said. “Then  , understood it all  in an
instant—, pulled  it up,”  he said, pantomiminJ the  act of reelinJ  in a fish.
“The Celestial KinJdom  was far  behind Nippon and Atlantis  in  nanotech.
The Fists  could always  have burned the  barbarians' Feed lines, but  this
would only  have plunJed the  peasants into poverty and made the people

511
lonJ for  foreiJn  Joods. The decision was  made to leapfroJ  the barbarian
tribes by developinJ  Seed technoloJy. At first  you  pursued the proMect in
cooperation with   second-tier  phyles  like  ,srael,  Armenia,   and  Greater
Serbia,  but  they   proved  unreliable.  AJain    and  aJain  your   carefully
cultivated networks were scattered by Protocol Enforcement.

       “But  throuJh  these failures you  made contact for the  first time  with
CryptNet, whom you  doubtless view as Must another triad—a contemptible
band of conspirators. However, CryptNet was tied in with somethinJ much
deeper and more interestinJ—the society of the Drummers. With their flaky
and shallow Western perspective, CryptNet didn't Jrasp the  full  power of
the Drummers' collective mind. But you Jot it riJht away.

       “All    you   reTuired to   initiate   the  Seed proMect was  the  rational,
analytical mind of a nanotechnoloJical enJineer. , fit the bill  perfectly. You
dropped me into the society of  the Drummers like  a seed into fertile  soil,
and my  knowledJe  spread throuJh them  and permeated their  collective
mind—as their  thouJhts spread into  my own  unconscious. They became
like an extension of  my own  brain. For  years , laboured on  the problem,
twenty-four hours a day.

       “Then,  before ,  was able  to finish  the  Mob, , was pulled out by  my
superiors at Protocol Enforcement. ,  was close to beinJ  finished. But  not
finished yet.”

       “Your  superiors had uncovered our plan?”

       “Either  they are completely iJnorant, or else they know everythinJ and
are pretendinJ iJnorance,” Hackworth said.

       “But  surely  you have told  them everythinJ  now,”  Dr. ;   said  almost
inaudibly.

       “,f  ,  were to answer that Tuestion, you would have no reason not to kill
me,” Hackworth said.

512
       Dr. ;    nodded, not so  much to  concede the point  as to  express
sympathy with Hackworth's admirably cynical train of thouJht—as thouJh
Hackworth, after a series of seeminJly inconclusive moves, had suddenly
flipped over a larJe territory of stones on a Jo board.

       “There are those who would advocate that course, because of what has
happened with the Jirls,” Dr. ; said.

       Hackworth was so startled to hear this  that he became somewhat
liJhtheaded for a moment and too  self-conscious to speak. “Have the
Primers proved useful?” he finally said, tryinJ not to sound Jiddy.

       Dr. ;    Jrinned broadly for  a  moment. Then the emotion dropped
beneath the surface aJain, like a breachinJ whale. “They must have been
useful to someone,” he said. “My opinion is that we made a mistake in
savinJ the Jirls.”

       “How can this act of humanity possibly have been a mistake?”

       Dr. ;  considered it. “,t would be more correct to say that, althouJh it
was virtuous to save them, it was mistaken to believe that they could be
raised properly. We lacked the resources to raise them individually, and so
we raised them with books. But the only proper way to raise a child is
within a family. The Master could have told us as much, had we listened to
his words.”

       “Some of those Jirls will one day choose to follow in the ways of the
Master,” Hackworth said, “and then the wisdom of your decisions will be
demonstrated.”

       This seemed to be a Jenuinely new thouJht to Dr. ;. His Ja]e returned
to the window. Hackworth sensed that the matter of the  Jirls  and the
Primers had been concluded.

       “,  will  be open and frank,”  said Dr. ;   after some ruminative tea-
slurpinJ, “and you will not believe that , am beinJ so, because it is in the

513
heads of those from the Outer Tribes to think that we never speak directly.
But perhaps in time you will see the truth of my words.

       “The  Seed is almost finished. When you left, the buildinJ of it  slowed
down very much—more than we expected. We thouJht that the Drummers,
after ten years, had absorbed your knowledJe and could continue the work
without  you. But  there is  somethinJ in  your  mind  that you  have Jained
throuJh your years of scholarly studies that the Drummers, if they ever had
it, have Jiven up and cannot Jet back unless they come out of the darkness
and live their lives in the liJht aJain.

       “The  war aJainst the Coastal Republic reaches a critical moment. We
ask you to help us now.”

       “,  must  say that it is  nearly inconceivable for  me to help  you at this
point,”  Hackworth  said, “unless it   would  be in  the interest  of  my tribe,
which does not strike me as a likely prospect.”

       “We   need you  to   help  us finish   buildinJ   the  Seed,”  Dr.  ;    said
doJJedly.

       Only  decades of traininJ in emotional repression kept Hackworth from
lauJhinJ out loud. “Sir. You are a worldly  man and a scholar. Certainly you
are aware of the position of  Her MaMesty's Jovernment, and indeed of the
Common Economic Protocol itself, on the subMect of Seed technoloJies.”

       Dr. ;   raised one hand a few inches from the tabletop, palm down, and
pawed once at the air. Hackworth recoJni]ed it as the Jesture that well-to-
do Chinese used to  dismiss  beJJars, or  even to  call  bullshit  on  people
durinJ meetinJs. “They are wronJ,” he said. “They do not understand. They
think of  the Seed from a Western perspective. Your cultures—and that of
the Coastal Republic—are poorly orJani]ed. There is no  respect for order,
no reverence for authority. Order must be enforced from above lest anarchy
break out. You are afraid to Jive the Seed to your people because they can
use it to  make weapons, viruses, druJs of  their  own desiJn,  and destroy
order. You enforce order throuJh control  of the Feed. But  in the Celestial
KinJdom, we are disciplined, we revere authority, we have order within our

514
own minds, and hence the family is orderly, the villaJe is orderly,  the state
is orderly. ,n our hands the Seed would be harmless.”

       “Why  do you need it?” Hackworth said.

       “We  must have technoloJy to live,”  Dr. ;    said, “but we must have it
with our own ti.”

       Hackworth  thouJht  for   a moment  that  Dr.  ;   was  referrinJ  to  the
beveraJe. But the Doctor beJan to trace characters on the tabletop, his hand
movinJ deftly  and Jracefully, the brocade sleeve raspinJ across the plastic
surface. “Yong is the outer manifestation of somethinJ. Ti is the underlyinJ
essence. TechnoloJy is a yong associated with a particular ti that is”—the
Doctor stumbled here and, throuJh a noticeable effort, refrained from usinJ
peMorative terms like    barbarian   or   gwailo—   “that   is   Western,  and
completely alien to us. For centuries, since the time of the Opium Wars, we
have struJJled  to absorb  the yong  of  technoloJy  without  importinJ  the
Western ti. But it has been impossible. -ust as our ancestors could not open
our ports to the West without acceptinJ the poison of opium, we could  not
open our lives to Western technoloJy without  takinJ in  the Western ideas,
which have been as a plaJue on our society. The result has been centuries of
chaos. We ask you to end that by JivinJ us the Seed.”

       “,  do not understand why the Seed will help you.”

       “The  Seed is technoloJy rooted in the Chinese ti. We have lived by the
Seed for five thousand years,” Dr.  ;   said. He waved his hand toward  the
window. “These were rice paddies before they were parkinJ lots. Rice was
the basis for our society. Peasants planted the seeds and had hiJhest status
in the Confucian hierarchy. As the Master said, “Let the producers be many
and the  consumers few.'  When  the  Feed came in   from  Atlantis,   from
Nippon, we  no lonJer  had to plant,  because the rice now came from  the
matter compiler. ,t was the destruction of our society. When our society was
based upon plantinJ, it could truly be said, as the Master did, “Virtue is the
root; wealth is the result.' But under the Western ti, wealth comes not from
virtue  but from  cleverness. So  the filial   relationships became deranJed.

515
Chaos,” Dr. ;  said reJretfully,  then looked up from his tea and nodded out
the window. “ParkinJ lots and chaos.”

       Hackworth remained silent for a full  minute. ,maJes had come into his
mind aJain, not a fleetinJ  hallucination this time,  but a full-fledJed  vision
of a China freed from  the yoke of the foreiJn  Feed. ,t was somethinJ he'd
seen before,  perhaps  somethinJ  he'd  even   helped  create.  ,t   showed
somethinJ no gwailo would  ever Jet to see: the Celestial KinJdom  durinJ
the cominJ AJe of  the Seed. Peasants tended their fields and paddies, and
even in times of drouJht  and flood, the earth brouJht forth  a rich  harvest:
food, of course, but many unfamiliar  plants too, fruits  that could  be made
into medicines, bamboo a thousand times stronJer than the natural varieties,
trees that produced synthetic rubber and pellets  of  clean safe fuel. ,n  an
orderly procession the suntanned farmers brouJht their  proceeds to Jreat
markets in clean cities  free of  cholera and strife,  where all  of  the younJ
people were  respectful and  dutiful  scholars  and all   of  the  elders were
honored and cared for. This was a ractive simulation as biJ as all of China,
and Hackworth could have lost himself  in it,  and perhaps did for he knew
not how lonJ. But  finally  he closed his eyes, blinked it away, sipped some
tea to brinJ his rational mind back into control.

       “Your  arJuments are not without merit,” Hackworth  said. “Thank you
for helpinJ  me to  see the matter in  a  different liJht.   , will   ponder these
Tuestions on my return to ShanJhai.”

       Dr. ;   escorted him to the parkinJ lot  of the McDonald's. The heat felt
pleasant at first, like a relaxinJ bath, thouJh Hackworth knew  that soon he
would feel as if he were drowninJ in  it. Kidnapper ambled over and folded
its leJs, allowinJ Hackworth to mount it easily.

       “You  have helped us willinJly   for  ten years,” Dr.  ;   said. “,t  is your
destiny to make the Seed.”

       “Nonsense,”  Hackworth   said, “,    did  not  know   the nature  of   the
proMect.”

516
       Dr.  ;   smiled. “You  knew it  perfectly well.”   He freed one hand from
the lonJ  sleeves of his  robe and shook  his finJer  at  Hackworth, like  an
indulJent teacher pretendinJ to scold a clever but mischievous pupil. “You
do these thinJs not to serve your 4ueen but to serve your own nature, -ohn
Hackworth, and , understand your nature. For you cleverness is its own end,
and once you have seen a clever way to do a thinJ, you must do it, as water
findinJ  a crack in  a dike  must pass throuJh it  and cover the land  on the
other side.”

       “Farewell,  Dr. ;,”   Hackworth said. “You will  understand that althouJh
, hold you in the hiJhest personal esteem, , cannot earnestly wish you Jood
fortune in your current endeavour.” He doffed his hat and bowed low to one
side, forcinJ Kidnapper  to adMust its stance a bit. Dr. ;  returned the bow,
JivinJ  Hackworth another look at that coral  button on his cap. Hackworth
spurred Kidnapper on to ShanJhai.

         

He followed  a  more northerly  route  now, alonJ  one of  the  many radial
hiJhways that converJed on the  metropolis. After  he had been ridinJ  for
some time, he became consciously aware of a sound that had been brushinJ
aJainst the outer frinJes of  perceptibility  for  some time: a  heavy, distant,
and rapid drumbeat, perhaps twice as fast as the beat of his own heart. His
first  thouJht,  of  course, was of  the  Drummers, and  he was  tempted to
explore one of the nearby canals to see whether their colony had spread its
tendrils this far inland. But then he looked northward across the flat land for
a couple of miles and saw a lonJ procession makinJ its way down another
hiJhway, a dark column of pedestrians marchinJ on ShanJhai.

       He  saw  that  his  path  was  converJinJ  with   theirs,  so  he spurred
Kidnapper forward at a hand-Jallop, hopinJ to reach the intersection of the
roads before  it   was  cloJJed   by  this   column  of   refuJees.  Kidnapper
outdistanced them easily, but to no avail; when he reached the intersection,
he  found  it   had  been  sei]ed  by   the  column's  vanJuard,   which  had
established a roadblock there and would not let him pass.

517
       The  continJent now controllinJ   the intersection consisted entirely of
Jirls, some eleven or twelve years old. There were several do]en of  them,
and they had apparently taken the obMective by force from a smaller Jroup
of Fists, who could now be seen lyinJ in the shade of some mulberry trees,
hoJtied with plastic rope. Probably three-Tuarters of the Jirls were on Juard
duty, mostly armed with sharpened bamboo stakes, thouJh a few Juns and
blades were in evidence. The remaininJ  Tuarter were on break, hunkered
down in  a  circle  near the intersection,  sippinJ  freshly  boiled water  and
concentratinJ intently  on  books. Hackworth  recoJni]ed   the books;  they
were all identical, and they all had marbled Made covers, thouJh all of them
had been personali]ed with stickers, Jraffiti, and other decorations over the
years.

       Hackworth  reali]ed  that  several more  Jirls,  orJani]ed  in  Jroups  of
four, had been followinJ   him  down the road  on bicycles; these outriders
passed by him now and reMoined their Jroup.

       He  had  no  choice  but  to  wait  until   the column   had passed. The
drumbeat Jrew and Jrew  in  volume until  the  pavement shook with  each
blow, and the shock absorption Jear built  into  Kidnapper's leJs went into
play, flinchinJ   minutely at  each beat. Another  vanJuard passed throuJh:
Hackworth  easily  calculated  its  si]e   at  two   hundred and  fifty-six.    A
battalion was  four platoons,  each of  which  was four  companies of  four
troops of  four  Jirls  each. The vanJuard consisted of  one such battalion,
movinJ  at a  very  brisk  double-time, probably  JoinJ  ahead of  the  main
Jroup to fall upon the next maMor intersection.

       Then, finally, the main column passed throuJh, orJani]ed in battalions,
each foot hittinJ  the Jround  in  unison with  all  the others. Each battalion
carried a few sedan chairs, which were passed from one four-Jirl  troop to
another every few minutes to spread out the work. They were not luxurious
palanTuins but   were  improvised  from   bamboo  and  plastic   rope  and
upholstered with  materials  stripped from   old  plastic  cafeteria furniture.
RidinJ in  these chairs were Jirls who  did not  seem all that different from
the others, except that they miJht have been a year or two older. They did
not seem to be officers;  they were not  JivinJ  orders and wore no  special

518
insiJnia.  Hackworth did  not  understand why  they  were  ridinJ  in  sedan
chairs until he Jot a look at one of them, who had crossed one ankle up on
her knee and taken her slipper off.  Her foot  was defective; it  was several
inches too short.

       But  all  of  the other sedan chair  Jirls  were deeply absorbed in  their
Primers. Hackworth unclipped a small optical device from his watch chain,
a nanotech telescope/microscope that freTuently came in handy, and used it
to look  over one Jirl's  shoulder. She was lookinJ at a diaJram  of a  small
nanotechnoloJical  device,  workinJ    her   way   throuJh   a  tutorial    that
Hackworth had written several years aJo.

       The column  went past much faster  than Hackworth had feared; they
moved down the hiJhway like  a piston. Each battalion carried a banner, a
very modest thinJ improvised  from a  painted bedsheet. Each banner bore
the number of  the battalion  and a crest that  Hackworth knew  well,  as it
played an important role in the Primer. ,n all,  he counted two hundred and
fifty-six   battalions. Sixty-five   thousand Jirls  ran  past him,  hell-bent  on
ShanJhai.


                 From  the Primer, Princess Nell's return  to the Dark
                   Castle; the death of Harv; The Books of the Book 
                    and of the Seed; Princess Nell's quest to find her 
                 mother. Destruction of the Causeway; Nell falls  into 
                                  the hands of Fists; she escapes 
                                 into a greater peril;  deliverance.

       Nell  opened her eyes and propped herself up on one elbow. The Primer
fell  shut and slid  off   her belly  onto  the mattress. She had fallen  asleep
readinJ it.

       The Jirls  on  their bunkbeds lay all  around her, breathinJ Tuietly and
smellinJ of soap. ,t made her want to lie  back down and sleep too. But for
some reason she was up on one elbow. Some instinct had told her she had to
be up.

522
       She sat up and drew her knees up to her chest, freeinJ the hem of her
niJhtJown from  between the sheets, then spun around and dropped to the
floor soundlessly. Her bare feet took her silently between the rows of bunks
and into  the little   lounJe  in  the corner  of  the floor   where the  Jirls  sat
toJether, had tea, brushed their hair,  watched old passives. ,t  was empty
now, the liJhts were off, the corner windows exposinJ a vast panorama: to
the  northeast, the  liJhts   of   New  Chusan  and  of   the  Nipponese  and
Hindustani concessions standinJ a few kilometers offshore, and the outlyinJ
parts  of   PudonJ.   Downtown   PudonJ   was  all    around,  its   floatinJ,
mediatronic skyscrapers like biblical pillars of fire. To the northwest lay the
HuanJ Pu River, ShanJhai, its suburbs, and the ravaJed silk and tea districts
beyond. No fires burned there now; the Feed lines had been burned all the
way to the edJe of  the city, and the Fists had stopped at the outskirts and
hunkered down as they souJht a way to penetrate the tattered remains of the
security Jrid.

       Nell's eye was drawn toward the water. Downtown PudonJ offered the
most spectacular urban  niJhtscape ever  devised, but  she always  found
herself lookinJ past it, starinJ instead at the HuanJ Pu, or the YanJ]te to the
north, or to the curvature of the Pacific beyond New Chusan.

       She'd  been havinJ  a  dream,  she reali]ed.   She had  awakened not
because of any external disturbance but because of what had happened in
that dream. She had to remember it; but, of course, she couldn't.

       -ust  a  few   snatches: a  woman's face,  a  beautiful   younJ  woman,
perhaps wearinJ a crown,  but  seen muddily, as throuJh  turbulent  water.
And somethinJ that Jlittered in her hands.

       No, danJlinJ beneath her hands. A piece of Mewelry on a Jolden chain.

       Could it  have been a key? Nell could not brinJ the imaJe back, but an
instinct told her that it was.

       Another detail too: a JleaminJ swath of somethinJ that passed in front
of her  face once, twice,  three times. SomethinJ yellow,  with  a  repeatinJ
pattern woven into it: a crest consistinJ of a book, a seed, and crossed keys.

523
       Cloth   of  Jold.   LonJ   aJo  the  mermaids  had  brouJht  her  to   her
stepfather, and she had been wrapped in cloth of Jold, and from this she had
always known that she was a Princess.

       The woman in the dream, veiled in swirlinJ  water, must have been her
mother. The dream was a memory from  her lost  infancy. And  before her
mother had Jiven her  up to the  mermaids, she had Jiven Princess Nell  a
Jolden key on a chain.

       Nell   perched herself  on  the  windowsill,   leaned  aJainst  the  pane,
opened the Primer, and flipped all the way back to the beJinninJ. ,t started
with the same old story,  as ever, but told now  in more mature prose. She
read the story of how her stepfather had Jotten her from the mermaids, and
read it  aJain,  drawinJ  out  more details,  askinJ  it  Tuestions, callinJ  up
detailed illustrations.

       There, in one of the illustrations, she saw it: her stepfather's lockbox, a
humble plank chest bound in rusted iron straps, with a heavy old-fashioned
padlock, stored underneath his bed. ,t was in this chest that he had stored
the cloth of Jold—and, perhaps, the key as well.

       PaJinJ  forward  throuJh the  book, she came across a lonJ-forJotten
story  of   how,   followinJ    her   stepfather's  disappearance, her  wicked
stepmother had taken the lockbox to a hiJh cliff above the sea and flunJ it
into the  waves, destroyinJ any  evidence that Princess Nell  was of  royal
blood. She had not  known  that her stepdauJhter was watchinJ  her from
between the branches of a thicket, where she often concealed herself durinJ
her stepmother's raJes.

       Nell  flipped to the last paJe of the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.

       “  'Princess Nell Jathered the hem of her niJhtJown in  both hands and
raised it over her head, lettinJ the chill wind stream over her body and carry
the Jarment away,' ” Nell said. “  'Then, drawinJ a deep breath and closinJ
her eyes, she bent her leJs and spranJ forward into space.' ”

       She  was readinJ  about  the  way  the  illuminated  waves rushed  up
toward her when suddenly the room filled with liJht. She looked toward the
door, thinkinJ that someone had come in and turned the liJhts on,  but she
was alone in the room,  and the liJht  was flickerinJ   aJainst the wall.  She
turned her head the other way.

       The  center span of  the Causeway had become a ball  of  white  liJht
hurlinJ its  marbled shroud of  cold dark matter  into the niJht.  The sphere
expanded until  it  seemed to occupy  most  of  the interval  between New
Chusan and the  PudonJ  shoreline,  thouJh  by  this  time  the  color   had
deepened from white into reddish-oranJe, and the explosion had punched a
si]able crater into the water, which developed into a circular wave of steam
and spray that ran effortlessly across the ocean's surface like the arc of liJht
cast by a pocket torch.

525
       FraJments of the Jiant Feed line that had once constituted most of the
Causeway's mass had been pitched into the sky by the explosion and now
tumbled end over end throuJh the niJht  sky, the slowness of their  motion
bespeakinJ their si]e, castinJ  yellow  sulfurous liJht  over the city  as they
burned furiously  in  the wind-blast  created by  their own  movement. The
liJht  limned a  pair of  tremendous pillars  of  water vapor  risinJ  from  the
ocean north and south of the Causeway; Nell  reali]ed  that the Fists must
have blown the Nipponese and Hindustani Feeds at the same moment. So
the Fists of   RiJhteous Harmony  had nanotechnoloJical explosives  now;
they'd come a lonJ way since they'd tried to torch the bridJe over the HuanJ
Pu with a few cylinders of hydroJen.

       The  shock wave rapped at the  window, startlinJ  several of  the Jirls
from sleep. Nell  heard them murmurinJ to one another in  the bunk room.
She wondered if she should Jo in and warn them that  PudonJ was cut off
now, that the  final  assault of  the Fists  had commenced. But thouJh  she
could not  understand what they  were sayinJ, she could  understand their
tone of voice clearly enouJh: They were not surprised by this, nor unhappy.

       They  were all   Chinese and could  become subMects of the Celestial
KinJdom  simply   by  donninJ   the  conservative Jarb   of  that  tribe   and
showinJ due deference to any mandarins who happened by. No doubt this
was exactly what they would do as soon as the Fists came to PudonJ. Some
of them miJht  suffer deprivation, imprisonment, or rape, but within  a year
they would all  be inteJrated into  the C.K., as if  the Coastal Republic had
never existed.

       But if  the news feeds from the interior meant anythinJ, the Fists would
kill  Nell Jradually, with  many small cuts and burns, when they Jrew weary
of rapinJ her. ,n recent days she had often seen the Chinese Jirls talkinJ in
little Jroups and sneakinJ Jlances at her, and the suspicion had Jrown in her
breast that some of them miJht  know of  the attack in  advance and miJht
make arranJements to turn Nell over to the Fists as a demonstration of their
loyalty.

526
       She opened the door a crack and saw two of these Jirls paddinJ toward
the bunk room where  Nell  usually slept, carryinJ  lenJths of  red polymer
ribbon.

       As  soon as they had stolen into Nell's bunk room,  Nell ran down  the
corridor and Jot to the elevators. As she awaited the elevator, she was more
scared than she had ever been; the siJht of the cruel red ribbons in the small
hands of the Jirls had for some reason struck more terror into her heart than
the siJht of knives in the hands of Fists.

       A  shrill commotion arose from the bunk room.

       The bell for the elevator sounded.

       She heard the bunk room  door fly  open, and someone runninJ down
the hall.

       The elevator door opened.

       One of the Jirls  came into the lobby, saw her, and shrieked somethinJ
to the others in a dolphinlike sTueal.

       Nell  Jot into  the elevator, punched the button for the lobby, and held
down the  DOOR  CLOSE  button.  The Jirl   thouJht  for  a  moment, then
stepped forward to hold the door. Several more Jirls were runninJ down the
hall. Nell kicked the Jirl  in the face, and she spun away in a helix of blood.
The elevator door beJan to close. -ust as the two doors were meetinJ in the
center, throuJh the  narrowinJ  slit  she saw one of  the  other Jirls  divinJ
toward the wall button. The doors closed. There was a brief pause, and then
they slid open aJain.

       Nell  was already in the correct stance to defend herself. ,f she had to
beat each of the Jirls  to death individually,  she would  do it.  But  none of
them rushed the elevator. ,nstead, the leader  stepped forward and aimed
somethinJ at Nell.  There was a  little  poppinJ  noise, a pinprick  in  Nell's
midsection,  and  within   a   few   seconds she  felt   her   arms  becominJ
impossibly  heavy.  Her  bottom  drooped.  Her   head bowed.  Her   knees

527
buckled. She could not keep her eyes open; as they closed, she saw the Jirls
cominJ toward her, smilinJ with  pleasure, holdinJ up the red ribbons. Nell
could not move any part of her body, but she remained perfectly conscious
as they tied her up with the ribbon. They did it slowly and methodically and
perfectly; they did it every day of their lives.

       The tortures of  the next few hours were of a purely  experimental and
preliminary  nature.  They  did   not  last  for   lonJ   and  accomplished no
permanent damaJe. These Jirls  had  made a  livinJ   out  of  bindinJ   and
torturinJ people in a way that didn't leave scars, and that was all they really
knew. When the leader came up with  the idea of  shovinJ a ciJarette  into
Nell's cheek, it  was somethinJ entirely novel  and left the  rest of the Jirls
startled and silent for a few minutes. Nell sensed that most of the Jirls had
no stomach for such thinJs and merely wanted to turn her over to the Fists
in exchanJe for citi]enship in the Celestial KinJdom.

       The Fists themselves beJan to arrive some twelve hours later. Some of
them wore  conservative business suits,  some wore  the uniforms  of  the
buildinJ's security force, others looked as if they'd arrived to take a Jirl out
to a disco.

       They all  had thinJs to  do when they arrived. ,t  was obvious that this
suite would act as local headTuarters of some sort when the rebellion beJan
in earnest. They  beJan to  brinJ  up supplies  on the  freiJht  elevator and
seemed to spend a lot of time on  the telephone. More arrived every hour,
until Madame PinJ's suite was playinJ host to between one and two do]en.
Some of them  were very  tired and  dirty  and went to  sleep in  the bunks
immediately.

       ,n  a way, Nell wished that they would do whatever they were JoinJ to
do and Jet  it  over with  fast. But  nothinJ  happened for Tuite  some time.
When the first Fists arrived, the Jirls brouJht  them in to see Nell, who had
been shoved under a bed and was now lyinJ there in a puddle of her own
urine. The leader shone a liJht  on her  face briefly  and then turned away,
completely uninterested. ,t seemed that once he'd verified that the Jirls had
done their bit for the revolution, Nell ceased to be relevant.

528
       She supposed it was inevitable that, in due time, these men would take
those liberties with her that have ever been claimed as anJary by irreJular
fiJhtinJ  men, who  have willfully    severed themselves from the  softeninJ
feminine influence of civili]ed  society, with those women who have had the
misfortune to become their captives. To make this prospect less attractive,
she took the desperate measure of allowinJ her person to  become tainted
with the  noisome issue of her natural  internal processes. But most of the
Fists were  too  busy, and  when  some of   the  JrunJy  foot-soldier  types
arrived, Madame PinJ's Jirls were eaJer to make themselves useful in this
reJard. Nell   reflected  that  a  bunch of   soldiers  who  found  themselves
billeted in a bawdy-house would naturally arrive  with certain expectations,
and that the inmates would be unwise to disappoint them.

       Nell  had Jone into the world to seek her fortune and this was what she
had found. She understood more forcibly   than ever the  wisdom  of Miss
Matheson's remarks about the hostility of the world and the importance of
belonJinJ to a powerful tribe; all of  Nell's intellect, her vast knowledJe and
skills, accumulated over a lifetime of intensive traininJ, meant nothinJ at all
when she was confronted with a handful of  orJani]ed peasants. She could
not  really   sleep  in   her  current   position   but  drifted   in   and   out  of
consciousness, visited occasionally by hallucinatory wakinJ dreams. More
than once she dreamed that the Constable had come in his hoplite suit  to
rescue her; and the pain she felt when she returned to full consciousness and
reali]ed that her  mind had been lyinJ  to her, was worse than any tortures
others miJht inflict.

       Eventually  they Jot  tired of  the stink under the  bed and draJJed her
out of there on a smear of half-dried body fluids. ,t had been at least thirty-
six hours since her capture. The leader of the Jirls, the one who had put out
the ciJarette on Nell's face, cut the red ribbon away and cut off Nell's filthy
niJhtJown  with   it.  Nell's  limbs   bounced on  the  floor.  The  leader had
brouJht a whip  that they sometimes used on clients and beat Nell  with  it
until circulation returned. This spectacle drew Tuite a crowd of Fist soldiers,
who crowded into the bunk room to watch.

529
       The Jirl   drove Nell  on hands and knees to a maintenance closet and
made her Jet out a bucket and mop. Then she made Nell clean up the mess
under the bed, freTuently inspectinJ the results and beatinJ her, apparently
actinJ out a parody of a rich  Westerner bossinJ around some poor runninJ
doJ. ,t became clear after the third or fourth scrubbinJ of the floor that this
was beinJ done as much for the entertainment of the soldiers as for hyJienic
reasons.

       Then  it  was back to  the maintenance closet, where Nell  was bound
aJain, this time with liJhtweiJht  police shackles, and left there on the floor
in the dark, naked and filthy.  A  few minutes later, her possessions—some
clothes that the Jirls didn't like and a book they couldn't read—were thrown
in there with her.

       When she was sure that the Jirl with  the whip had Jone, she spoke to
her Primer and told it to make liJht.

       She could  see a biJ matter  compiler on  the floor  in  the back of  the
closet; the Jirls used it to manufacture larJer items when they were needed.
This buildinJ  was apparently hooked up to the Coastal Republic's PudonJ
Feed, because it hadn't lost Feed services when the Causeway had blown
up; and indeed the Fists probably would not have bothered to establish their
base here if the place had been cut off.

       Once every couple of  hours or so, a Fist would  come into this  closet
and order the M.C.  to  create somethinJ, usually a simple  bulk  substance
like rations. On  two of  these occasions, Nell was outraJed in  the manner
she had lonJ  suspected was inevitable.  She closed  her eyes  durinJ  the
commission of these atrocities, knowinJ that whatever miJht be done to the
mere vessel of her soul by the likes of these, her soul itself was as serene, as
remote from their Jrasp, as is the full moon from the furious incantations of
an aboriJinal shaman. She tried to  think  about the machine that  she was
desiJninJ in  her head, with  the help  of  the Primer, about  how the  Jears
meshed and the bearinJs spun, how  the rod  loJic  was  proJrammed and
where the enerJy was stored.

530
       On her second niJht in  the closet, after most of the Fists had Jone to
bed and use of the matter compiler had apparently ceased for the niJht, she
instructed the Primer to load her desiJn into the M.C.'s memory, then crept
forward and pressed the START button with her tonJue.

       Ten minutes later, the machine released its vacuum with a shriek. Nell
tonJued the door open. A knife and a sword rested on the floor of the M.C.
She turned  herself  around,  movinJ  in   small,  cautious  increments and
breathinJ deeply so that she would not  whimper from  the pain emanatinJ
from those parts of her  that were most tender and vulnerable and yet had
been most viciously depredated by her captors. She reached backward with
her shackled hands and Jripped the handle of the knife.

       Footsteps were approachinJ down  the hallway.  Someone must have
heard the hiss of the M.C. and thouJht it was dinner time. But Nell couldn't
rush this; she had to be careful.

       The door  opened. ,t was one of  the rankinJ Fists,  perhaps the rouJh
eTuivalent of a serJeant. He shone a torch in her  face, then chuckled and
turned on the overhead liJht.

       Nell's  body blocked his view of  the M.C., but  it was obvious that she
was reachinJ for somethinJ. He probably assumed it was only food.

       He stepped forward and kicked her  casually in the ribs, then Jrabbed
her upper arm and Merked her away from the M.C., causinJ such pain in her
wrists that tears spurted down her face. But she held on to the knife.

       The Fist  was starinJ into  the M.C. He  was startled and would be for
several moments. Nell maneuvered the knife so that the blade was touchinJ
nothinJ  but  the link   between the  shackles, then  hit  the  ON  switch.  ,t
worked; the edJe of  the blade came to life  like  a nanotech chainsaw and
]ipped throuJh the link in a moment, like clippinJ a finJernail.  Nell brouJht
it around her body in the same motion and buried it in the base of the Fist's
spine.

531
       He  fell  to the  Jround without  speakinJ—he wasn't feelinJ  any  pain
from that wound or from  anythinJ below his waist.  Before he could assess
matters any further, she plunJed the knife into the base of his skull.

       He was wearinJ  simple peasant stuff: indiJo  trousers and a tank-top.
She put them on. Then she tied her hair up behind her head usinJ strinJs cut
from a mop  and devoted a precious minute or two  to stretchinJ  her arms
and leJs.

       And  then it was out  into the hallway  with  her knife in  her waistband
and her sword in her hands. GoinJ round a corner, she cut a man in half as
he emerJed from the bathroom; the sword kept JoinJ of its own momentum
and carved a  lonJ  Jash in  the  wall.  This  assault released a  prodiJious
amount of blood, which Nell put behind her as Tuickly as possible. Another
man was on Juard in the elevator lobby, and as he came to investiJate the
sounds, she ran him  throuJh  several times  Tuickly,  takinJ  a paJe  from
Napier's book this time.

       The  elevators  were  now  under  some kind   of  central  control  and
probably subMect to surveillance; rather than press the button in the lobby,
she cut a hole in the doors, sheathed her sword, and clambered out onto a
ladder that ran down the shaft.

       She forced herself to descend slowly and carefully, pressinJ herself flat
aJainst the runJs whenever the car went by. By the time she had descended
perhaps fifty or  sixty floors,  the buildinJ  had come awake; all of  the cars
were in constant motion, and when they went past her, she could hear men
talkinJ excitedly inside them.

       LiJht  flooded into  the shaft several floors below. The doors had been
forced open. A couple of Fists thrust their heads out carefully into the shaft
and beJan lookinJ  up and down,  shininJ torches here and there. Several
floors below them, more Fists pried another door open; but they had to pull
their heads in rapidly as the ascendinJ car nearly decapitated them.

       She had imaJined that Madame PinJ's was playinJ host to an isolated
cell of  Fists, but it  was now clear that  most if  not all  of the  buildinJ  had

532
been taken over. For that matter, all of PudonJ miJht now be a part of  the
Celestial KinJdom. Nell  was much more profoundly  isolated than she had
feared.

       The skin of her arms Jlowed yellow-pink  in the beam of a torch shone
up from  below. She did  not  make the mistake of  lookinJ  down  into  the
da]]linJ  liJht  and did  not have to; the excited voice  of the Fist below  her
told her that she had been discovered. A moment later, the liJht vanished as
the ascendinJ elevator interposed itself between Nell and the Fists who had
seen her.

       She recalled Harv  and his buds elevator-surfinJ in  their old  buildinJ
and reckoned that this would be a Jood time to take up the practice. As the
car rose toward her, she Mumped off the ladder, tryinJ to Jive herself enouJh
upward thrust to match its velocity. She landed hard on the roof, for it was
movinJ far  more rapidly  than she could Mump. The roof knocked her feet
out from under her, and she fell backward, slamminJ her arms out as DoMo
had tauJht her so that she absorbed the impact with her fists and forearms,
not her back.

       More  excited talkinJ from inside the car. The access panel on the roof
suddenly flew into the air, driven  out of its  frame by a well-delivered kick
from below. A  head popped out of the open hatch; Nell skewered it on her
knife. The man tumbled down  into the car. There was no point  in waitinJ
now; the situation had Jone into violent motion, which Nell  was obliJed to
use. She rolled onto her belly and kicked both feet downward into the hatch,
spun down into the car, landed badly  on the corpse, and staJJered to one
knee. She had barked the point of her chin on the edJe of the hatch as she
fell throuJh and bitten her tonJue, so she was sliJhtly da]ed. A  Jaunt man
in a black leather skullcap was standinJ directly in front of her, reachinJ for
a Jun, and while  she was shovinJ  her knife  up throuJh  the center of his
thorax, she bumped into someone behind her. She Mumped to her feet and
spun around, terrified, readyinJ the knife for another blow, and discovered a
much more  terrified  man  in  a  blue coverall,  standinJ  by  the elevator's
control panel, holdinJ his arms up in front of his face and screaminJ.

533
       Nell  stepped back and lowered the point  of  the knife.  The man was
wearinJ the uniform of  a buildinJ services worker and had obviously been
yanked away from whatever  he had been doinJ and put  in  charJe of the
elevator's controls. The man whom Nell had Must killed, the one in the black
leather skullcap, was some sort  of low-level  official   in  the rebellion  and
could not be expected to demean himself by punchinJ the buttons himself.

       “Keep  JoinJ! 8p!  8p!”   she said, pointinJ at the ceilinJ. The last thinJ
she wanted was for him to stop the elevator at Madame PinJ's.

       The man bowed several times in Tuick  succession and did somethinJ
with the controls, then turned and smiled inJratiatinJly at Nell.

       As  a  Coastal Republic citi]en   workinJ  in  services, he  knew a  few
words of EnJlish, and Nell knew a few  of Chinese. “Down below—Fists?”
she said.

       “Many  Fist.”

       “Ground floor—Fists?”

       “Yes, many Fist Jround floor.”

       “Street—Fists?”

       “Fist,  army have fiJht in street.”

       “Around  this buildinJ?”

       “Fist  around this buildinJ all over.”

       Nell  looked  at  the elevator's control  panel: four  columns  of  tiJhtly
spaced buttons, color-coded accordinJ to each floor's  function:  Jreen for
shoppinJ, yellow for  residential, red for offices, and blue for  utility  floors.
Most of the blue floors were below Jround level, but one of  them was fifth
from the top.

       “BuildinJ   office?” she said, pointinJ to it.

534
       “Yes.”

       “Fists there?”

       “No,  Fist all down below. But Fist on roof!”

       “Go  there.”

       When the  elevator reached the fifth  floor  from the  top, Nell  had the
man free]e it  there, then climbed  on top and trashed its motors  so that it
would remain there. She dropped back into the car, tryinJ not to look at the
bodies or smell the reek of blood and other body fluids  that had Jotten all
over it, and that were now draininJ  out the open doors and drippinJ down
the shaft. ,t would not take lonJ for any of this to be discovered.

       She had some time, thouJh; all she had to do was decide how to make
use of it.  The maintenance closet had a matter compiler, Must like the one
Nell had used to make her weapons, and she knew that she could use it to
compile explosives and booby-trap the lobby. But the Fists had explosives
of their own  and could Must as well blow the top floors  of the  buildinJ  to
kinJdom come.

       For  that matter, they were probably  down in  some basement control
room watchinJ  traffic  on  the  buildinJ's  Feed network. 8se  of  the  M.C.
would simply announce her location; they would shut off the Feed and then
come after her slowly and carefully.

       She took a Tuick tour  of the offices, si]inJ  up her resources. LookinJ
out the panoramic windows of the finest office suite, she saw a new state of
affairs in the streets of PudonJ. Many of the skyscrapers had been rooted in
lines from  the foreiJn  Feeds and were now  dark, thouJh  in some places
flames vented from  broken windows,  castinJ primitive   illumination  over
the  streets a  thousand  feet  below.  These  buildinJs   had  mostly  been
evacuated, and so the streets were crowded with far more people than they
could  really  handle. The  pla]a   immediately  surroundinJ  this  particular
buildinJ  had been staked out by a  picket line  of  Fists and was relatively
uncrowded.

535
       She  found a  windowless  room  with  mediatronic  walls  that  bore a
bewilderinJ collaJe of  imaJes: flowers, details of European cathedrals and
Shinto temples, Chinese landscape art, maJnified   imaJes of  insects and
pollen Jrains,  many-armed ,ndian  Joddesses, planets and moons of   the
solar  system,   abstract  patterns  from   the   ,slamic   world,    Jraphs  of
mathematical eTuations, head shots of models male and female. Other than
that, the room was empty except for a model  of the buildinJ  that stood in
the  center  of   the  room,  about  Nell's   heiJht.   The  model's  skin   was
mediatronic, Must like the skin of  the buildinJ  itself,  and it  was currently
echoinJ (as she supposed) whatever imaJes were beinJ displayed on  the
outside of the buildinJ:   mostly advertisinJ panels, thouJh some Fists had
apparently come in here and scrawled Jraffiti across them.

       On top of  the model rested a stylus—Must a black stick pointed on one
end—and a palette, covered with  a  color wheel  and other controls.  Nell
picked them up, touched the tip of the stylus to a Jreen area on the palette's
color wheel, and drew it across the surface of the model. A JlowinJ  Jreen
line appeared alonJ the track of  the stylus, disfiJurinJ  an ad panel for  an
airship line.

       Whatever other  steps Nell miJht  take in  the time  she had left, there
was one thinJ she could do  Tuickly and easily  here. She was not entirely
sure why she did it, but  some intuition told  her that it  miJht  be useful; or
perhaps it was an artistic  urJe to make  somethinJ that would  live  lonJer
than she would, even if only by a few minutes. She beJan by erasinJ all of
the biJ advertisinJ  panels on the upper levels of the skyscraper. Then she
sketched out a simple line drawinJ in primary colors: an escutcheon in blue,
and within it, a crest depictinJ a book drawn in red and white; crossed keys
in Jold; and a seed in brown. She caused this imaJe to be displayed on all
sides of the skyscraper, between the hundredth and two-hundredth floors.

       Then she tried to think  of a way  out of this place. Perhaps there were
airships on the  roof.  There would  certainly  be Fist  Juards up there,  but
perhaps throuJh  a   combination  of   stealth  and  suddenness she could
overcome them. She used the emerJency stairs to make her way up to the
next floor, then  the next, and then the next. Two  fliJhts  above, she could

536
hear Fist Juards posted at the roof, talkinJ to each other and playinJ mah-
MonJJ. Many fliJhts below, she could hear more Fists makinJ their way up
the stairs one fliJht at a time, lookinJ for her.

       She was ponderinJ  her next move  when the Juards above her  were
rudely interrupted  by  orders sTuawkinJ  from  their  radios. Several  Fists
came charJinJ down the stairway, shoutinJ excitedly.  Nell, trapped in  the
stairwell, made herself ready to ambush them as they came toward her, but
instead they ran into the top floor and made for the elevator lobby. Within a
minute or two, an elevator had arrived and carried them away. Nell waited
for a while, listeninJ,  and could no lonJer hear the continJent approachinJ
from below.

       She  climbed  up   the  last  fliJhts   of  stairs  and  emerJed  onto  the
buildinJ's roof, exhilarated as much by the fresh air as by the discovery that
it was completely deserted. She walked to the edJe of the roof and peered
down almost  half  a mile  to  the street. ,n  the  black  windows  of  a dead
skyscraper across the way, she could see the mirror imaJe of Princess Nell's
crest.

       After  a minute or two, she noticed that somethinJ akin to a shock wave
was makinJ its  way  down  the street far  below, movinJ  in  slow  motion,
coverinJ a  city  block  every couple  of  minutes. Details  were difficult   to
make out at this distance: it was a hiJhly orJani]ed Jroup of pedestrians, all
wearinJ the  same Jenerally dark  clothinJ,  ramminJ  its way  throuJh  the
mob of refuJees, forcinJ the panicked barbarians toward the picket line of
the Fists or sideways into the lobbies of the dead buildinJs.

       Nell   was  transfixed  for   several minutes  by   this  siJht.  Then  she
happened to Jlance down a different street and saw the same phenomenon
there.

       She made  a Tuick  circuit  of  the  buildinJ's  roof.  All  in  all,  several
columns were  advancinJ inexorably  on  the  foundations of  the  buildinJ
where Nell stood.

537
       ,n  time, one of these columns broke throuJh the last of the obstructinJ
refuJees and reached the edJe of the broad open pla]a that surrounded the
foot of  Nell's  buildinJ,  where it  faced  off  aJainst the Fist  defenses. The
column  stopped abruptly  at  this  point   and waited  for   a  few  minutes,
collectinJ itself and waitinJ for the other columns to catch up.

       Nell    had  supposed  at  first    that  these  columns   miJht   be   Fist
reinforcements converJinJ on this buildinJ,  which was clearly  intended to
be the headTuarters of their final  assault on the  Coastal Republic. But  it
soon became evident that these newcomers had arrived for other purposes.
After  a few minutes  of unbearable tension had Jone by  in nearly  perfect
silence, the columns suddenly, on the same unheard siJnal, erupted into the
pla]a.  As they  debouched from  the narrow  streets, they spread out  into
many-pronJed formations, arranJinJ  themselves with   the precision  of  a
professional drill    team,  and  then  charJed  forward   into  the   suddenly
panicked and  disorJani]ed  Fists,  throwinJ   up  a  tremendous battle-cry.
When that sound echoed up two hundred stories to Nell's ears, she felt her
hair standinJ on end, because it was not the deep lusty roar of Jrown men
but the fierce thrill of thousands of younJ Jirls, sharp and penetratinJ as the
skirl of massed baJpipes.

       ,t  was Nell's tribe, and they had come for their leader. Nell spun on her
heel and made for the stairway.

       By  the time  she had reached Jround level  and burst  out, somewhat
unwisely, into the buildinJ's  lobby, the Jirls  had breached the walls of the
buildinJ  in  several places and  rushed in  upon the  remaininJ  defenders.
They moved in Jroups of four. One Jirl  (the larJest) would rush toward an
opponent, holdinJ a  pointed bamboo stick  aimed at  his heart.  While  his
attention was thus fixed, two  other Jirls  (the smallest) would converJe on
him  from  the  sides. Each  Jirl  would   huJ  one  of  his  leJs  and, actinJ
toJether, they would  lift  him  off  the Jround. The  fourth  Jirl  (the fastest)
would by this point have circled all the way round and would come in from
behind, drivinJ a knife  or other weapon into  the victim's back. DurinJ  the
half-do]en or so applications of this techniTue that Nell witnessed, it never

538
failed, and  none of  the Jirls   ever suffered more  than the  odd bruise  or
scrape.

       Suddenly she felt  a moment of  wild  panic as she thouJht  they were
doinJ the same to her; but  after she had been lifted into the air,  no attack
came from front or  back, thouJh many Jirls rushed in from  all  sides, each
addinJ her small strenJth to the paramount Joal of hoistinJ  Nell  hiJh into
the air. Even as the last remnants of the Fists were beinJ hunted down and
destroyed in the nooks and corners of the lobby, Nell  was beinJ borne on
the shoulders of her little sisters out the front doors of the buildinJ and into
the pla]a, where somethinJ like  a hundred thousand Jirls—Nell  could not
count all the reJiments and briJades—collapsed to their knees in unison, as
thouJh struck  down  by  a divine  wind,  and  presented her their  bamboo
stakes, pole knives, lead pipes, and nunchuks. The provisional commanders
of her divisions stood foremost, as did her provisional ministers of defense,
of state, and of research and development, all of them bowinJ to Nell,  not
with a Chinese bow or a Victorian one but somethinJ they'd come up with
that was in between.

       Nell  should have been tonJue-tied and  paraly]ed with  astonishment,
but she was not; for the first time in her life she understood why she'd been
put on the earth and felt  comfortable with  her position. One  moment, her
life  had been a  meaninJless abortion, and the  next it   all  made Jlorious
sense. She beJan to speak, the words rushinJ from her mouth as easily as if
she had been readinJ them from the paJes of the Primer. She accepted the
alleJiance of the  Mouse Army,  complimented them on  their  Jreat deeds,
and swept her  arm across the pla]a,  over  the heads of  her  little  sisters,
toward the  thousands upon thousands of  stranded soMourners from New
Atlantis, Nippon, ,srael, and all of the other Outer Tribes. “Our first  duty is
to protect these,” she said. “Show me the condition of the city and all those
in it.”

       They wanted to carry her, but she Mumped to the stones of the pla]a and
strode away from the buildinJ, toward her ranks, which parted to make way
for  her.  The  streets of   PudonJ  were  filled   with  hunJry   and  terrified
refuJees, and throuJh them,  in  simple peasant clothes streaked with  the

539
blood of  herself and of  others, broken shackles danJlinJ from  her wrists,
followed by her Jenerals and ministers, walked the barbarian Princess with
her book and her sword.


                     Carl Hollywood  takes a stroll to the waterfront.


Carl Hollywood was awakened by a rinJinJ in his ears and a burninJ in his
cheek that turned out to be an inch-lonJ fraJment of plate Jlass driven into
his flesh.  When  he sat up,  his  bed made clankinJ  and  crashinJ noises,
sheddinJ a heavy burden of shattered Jlass, and a fœtid exhalation from the
wrecked windows  blew  over his  face.  Old  hotels had their  charms, but
disadvantaJes too—such as windowpanes made out of antiTue materials.

       Fortunately some old  WyominJ  instinct had caused him  to leave his
boots next to the bed the niJht before. He inverted  each one and carefully
probed it for broken Jlass before he pulled it on. Only  when he had put on
all of his clothes and Jathered his thinJs toJether did he Jo to look  out the
window.

       His  hotel was near the HuanJ Pu waterfront. LookinJ across the river,
he could see that Jreat patches of PudonJ had Jone black aJainst the indiJo
sky of predawn. A few  buildinJs, connected to the indiJenous Feeds, were
still  lit   up. On  this  side  of  the  river  the  situation  was  not  so simple;
ShanJhai, unlike PudonJ, had lived throuJh many wars  and was therefore
made to be robust: the city  was rife with  secret power sources, old diesel
Jenerators, private Sources and Feeds, water tanks and cisterns. People still
raised chickens  for   food   in  the   shadow of   the  HonJkonJ&ShanJhai
BankinJ Corporation.  ShanJhai would weather the onslauJht  of the  Fists
much better than PudonJ.

       But  as a white person, Carl Hollywood miJht not weather it very  well
at all. ,t  was better to  be across the river, in  PudonJ, with the  rest of the
Outer Tribes.

540
       From here to the waterfront was about three blocks; but since this was
ShanJhai, those three blocks were frauJht with what in any other city would
be three miles' worth of complications. The main problem was JoinJ  to be
Fists; he could already hear the cries of  “Sha!  Sha!”  boilinJ  up from  the
streets, and shininJ a pocket torch throuJh the bars of his balcony, he could
see many  Fists,  emboldened by  the  destruction  of  the  foreiJn   Feeds,
runninJ  around with  their  scarlet Jirdles  and  headbands exposed to the
world.

       ,f  he weren't six and a half feet tall and blue-eyed, he'd probably try to
disJuise himself  as Chinese and slink  to  the waterfront,  and it  probably
wouldn't work.  He went  throuJh his closet  and hauled out his biJ  duster,
which swept  nearly to  his ankles.  ,t  was proof  aJainst bullets  and most
nanotech proMectiles.

       There was a lonJ item of luJJaJe he had thrown up on the closet shelf
unopened. HearinJ the reports of  trouble, he had taken the  precaution of
brinJinJ these relics with him:  an enJraved lever-action .44 rifle with  low-
tech iron siJhts and, as a last-ditch sort of thinJ, a Colt revolver. These were
unnecessarily Jlorious weapons, but he had lonJ aJo Jotten rid of any of his
Juns that did not have historical or artistic value.

       Two  Junshots sounded from within   the buildinJ,  very  close to him.
Moments later,  someone knocked at  his  door.  Carl  wrapped his  duster
around him, in case someone decided to fire throuJh the door, and peered
out throuJh  the peephole. To his  surprise, he  saw a white-haired  AnJlo
Jentleman with a handlebar mustache, JrippinJ a semiautomatic. Carl had
met him yesterday in the hotel bar; he was here tryinJ to clear up some kind
of business before the fall of ShanJhai.

       He  opened the door. The two men reJarded each other briefly.  “One
miJht  think   we  had   come  for  an   antiTue weapons  convention,”   the
Jentleman said throuJh his  mustache. “Say, ,'m  friJhtfully   sorry  to have
disturbed you, but , thouJht you  miJht like  to know  that there are Fists in
the hotel.” He Jestured down the corridor with his Jun. Carl poked his head

541
out and discovered a dead bellboy sprawled out in  front of  an open door,
still clutchinJ a lonJ knife.

       “As   it   happens, ,   was  already  up,”   said  Carl   Hollywood,   “and
contemplatinJ a bit of a stroll to the waterfront. Care to Moin me?”

       “DeliJhted.  Colonel Spence, Royal -oint Forces, Retired.”

       “Carl  Hollywood.”

       On  their  way  down  the  fire   stairs, Spence killed   two  more  hotel
employees whom he had, on somewhat ambiJuous Jrounds, identified  as
Fists. Carl was skeptical in both cases until Spence ripped their shirts open
to reveal the scarlet Jirdles beneath. “,t's  not that they're really  Fists, you
see,” Spence explained Movially. “-ust that when the Fists come, this sort of
nonsense becomes terribly fashionable.”

       After   exchanJinJ   some  more  self-consciously   dry   humor  about
whether they should settle their bills before departure, and how much you
were supposed to tip a bellboy  who came after you  with  a carvinJ  knife,
they aJreed it  miJht  be safest to exit  throuJh the kitchens.  Half  a do]en
dead Fists littered  the floor  here, their  bodies striped  with  the marks  of
cookie-cutters. ArrivinJ   at  the exit   they found  two  fellow   Juests, both
,sraelis, starinJ at them with  the fixed  Ja]e that implies  the presence of a
skull  Jun.  Seconds later,  they  were  Moined by  two  =ulu   manaJement
consultants carryinJ lonJ, telescopinJ poles with nanoblades affixed to the
ends, which they used to destroy all of the liJht fixtures in their path. ,t took
Carl a minute to appreciate their plan: They were all about to step out into a
dark alley, and they would need their niJht vision.

       The door beJan to shudder in its frame and make tremendous boominJ
noises. Carl stepped forward  and peered throuJh  the peephole; it  was a
couple of  urban homeboy types havinJ  at it  with  a  fire  axe. He stepped
away from the door, shruJJinJ the rifle from his shoulder, levered in a shell,
and fired it  throuJh the door, aiminJ  away from the youths. The  boominJ
stopped abruptly, and they heard the head of the axe rinJinJ like a bell as it
fell to the pavement.

542
       One  of  the  =ulus  kicked  the  door  open  and leapt  into   the alley,
whirlinJ  his blade in a vast, fatal arc like  the blade of a helicopter, slicinJ
throuJh a JarbaJe can but not hittinJ  any  people. When Carl came pilinJ
throuJh  the  door  a  few   seconds later,  he  saw  several  younJ  touJhs
scatterinJ down the alley, dodJinJ amonJ several do]en refuJees, loiterers,
and street people who pointed helpfully at their recedinJ backsides, makinJ
sure it was understood that their only reason for beinJ  in this  alley at this
time was to act as a sort of block watch on behalf of the gwailo visitors.

       Without  talkinJ  about it much, they fell  into an improvised formation
there in the  alley, where they had  a bit  of room  to maneuver. The =ulus
went in front, whirlinJ  their poles over their heads and hollerinJ some kind
of traditional  war-cry that drove  a Jood many of  the Chinese out of  their
path. One of the -ews went behind the =ulus, usinJ his skull Jun to pick off
any Fists who  charJed them. Then came Carl  Hollywood,  who,  with  his
heiJht and his rifle,   seemed to have ended up with the Mob of lonJ-ranJe
reconnaissance and defense. Colonel Spence and the other ,sraeli brouJht
up the rear, walkinJ backward most of the time.

       This  Jot them down the alley  without  much trouble, but that was the
easy part; when they reached the street, they were no lonJer the only focus
of action but mere motes in a sandstorm. Colonel Spence discharJed most
of a clip into the air;  the explosions were nearly inaudible in the chaos, but
the Jouts of liJht from the weapon's barrel drew some attention, and people
in their immediate vicinity actually Jot out of  their way. Carl saw one of the
=ulus do somethinJ very uJly with  his lonJ weapon and looked away; then
he reflected that it was the =ulus' Mob to break trail and his to concentrate on
more distant threats. He turned slowly around as he walked, tryinJ to iJnore
the threat that was Must beyond arm's lenJth and to Jet a view of the larJer
scene.

       They  had walked into a completely  disorJani]ed street fiJht  between
the Coastal Republic forces and the Fists of RiJhteous Harmony, which was
not made any clearer by the fact that many of the Coastals had defected by
tyinJ strips of red cloth round the arms of their uniforms,  and that many of
the Fists were not wearinJ any markinJs  at all, and that many others who

543
had no affiliation  were takinJ advantaJe of the situation to  loot stores and
were  beinJ  fouJht   off  by   private  Juards;  many   of  the  looters   were
themselves beinJ muJJed by orJani]ed JanJs.

       They were on NanMinJ Road, a broad thorouJhfare leadinJ straiJht to
the Bund and the HuanJ Pu, lined with four- and five-story buildinJs so that
many windows   looked  out  over  them,  any  one  of  which  miJht   have
contained a sniper.

       A  few  of them  did contain  snipers, Carl reali]ed,  but many of  these
were shootinJ across the street at each other, and the ones who were firinJ
into the street could  have been shootinJ  at anyone. Carl saw  one fellow
with  a laser-siJhted rifle  emptyinJ  clip  after  clip  into  the street, and  he
reckoned that this constituted a clear and present danJer; so at a moment
when their forward proJress had stalled momentarily, while the =ulus were
waitinJ  for  an  especially  desperate Coastal/Fist melee to  resolve  itself
ahead of them, Carl planted his feet, swunJ his rifle up to his shoulder, took
aim, and fired. ,n the dim  fire- and torch-liJht  risinJ  up from the street, he
could see powder  explode from  the stone window   frame Must above the
sniper's head. The sniper crinJed, then beJan to sweep the street with his
laser, lookinJ for the source of the bullet.

       Someone Mostled Carl from behind. ,t was Spence, who had been hit
with somethinJ and lost the use of his leJ. A Fist was in the Colonel's face.
Carl rammed the butt of the rifle into the man's chin, sendinJ him backward
into the melee with his eyes rolled up into their sockets. Then he levered in
another shell, raised the weapon to his shoulder aJain, and tried to find the
window with his sniper friend.

       He was still  there, tracinJ  a ruby-red line patiently  across the boilinJ
surface of the crowd. Carl took in a deep breath, released it slowly, prayed
that no one would bump into him, and sTuee]ed the triJJer. The rifle butted
him hard in the shoulder, and at the same moment he saw the sniper's rifle
fall  out of  the window,  spinninJ  end over end,  the laser beam sweepinJ
throuJh the smoke and steam like the trace on a radar scope.

544
       The  whole thinJ  had probably  been a bad  idea; if  any of  the  other
snipers had seen this, they'd be wantinJ to  Jet rid  of  him, whatever their
affiliation.  Carl levered in  another shell and then let the rifle  danJle from
one hand, pointed down at the street, where it wouldn't be so conspicuous.
He Jot the other hand into Spence's armpit and helped him continue down
the street. The ends of Spence's mustache wiJJled as he continued with his
endless and unflappable line of patter; Carl couldn't hear a word but nodded
encouraJinJly. Not even the most  literal-minded neo-Victorian  could take
that stiff-upper-lip  thinJ  seriously; Carl  reali]ed  now that  it was  all done
with a nod and a wink.  ,t  was not Colonel Spence's way of sayinJ that he
wasn't scared; it was, rather, a code of sorts, a face-savinJ way for him to
admit that  he was  terrified  half  out  of  his  wits,  and  for  Carl  to  admit
likewise.

       Several Fists  rushed them  at once;  the  =ulus  Jot  two,  the leadinJ
,sraeli Jot one, but another came in and bounced his knife from the ,sraeli's
knife-proof Macket. Carl raised the rifle, clampinJ the stock between his arm
and his body, and fired from the hip. The recoil nearly knocked the weapon
out of his hand; the Fist practically did a backflip.

       He couldn't  believe they had not reached the waterfront yet; they had
been doinJ this for hours. SomethinJ prodded him hard in the back, causinJ
him to stumble forward;  he looked back over his shoulder and saw a man
tryinJ to run  him throuJh with  a bayonet. Another man ran up and tried to
wrench the  rifle  out  of  Carl's  hand. Carl,  too  startled to  respond for  a
moment, finally  let  Jo  of Spence, reached across, and poked him  in the
eyes. A Jreat explosion sounded in his ear, and he looked over to see that
Spence had twisted  himself   round and  shot  the  attacker who  had  the
bayonet. The ,sraeli who had been JuardinJ their rear had simply vanished.
Carl raised his rifle toward the people who were converJinJ  on them from
the rear; that and Spence's pistol opened up a JratifyinJ clear space in their
wake. But somethinJ more powerful and terrifyinJ was drivinJ more people
toward them from the side, and as Carl tried to see what it was, he reali]ed
that a score of Chinese people were now between him and the =ulus. The
looks on their faces were pained and panicky; they were not attackinJ, they
were beinJ attacked.

545
       Suddenly all of the Chinese were Jone. Carl and Colonel Spence found
themselves comminJled  with  a  do]en  or  so  Boers—not  Must men, but
women and children  and elders too, a whole  laaJer on  the move. All   of
them surJed forward  instinctively  and reabsorbed the vanJuard of  Carl's
Jroup. They were a block from the waterfront.

       The Boer  leader, a stout man of about fifty,  somehow identified Carl
Hollywood as the leader, and they Tuickly redeployed what forces they had
for the final push to the waterfront. The only thinJ Carl remembered of this
conversation was the man sayinJ, “Good. You've Jot =ulus.” The Boers in
the vanJuard were  carryinJ  some sort  of  automatic weapons firinJ   tiny
nanotech hiJh-explosive rounds, which, indiscriminately  used, could have
turned the crowd into a rampart of chewed meat; but they fired the weapons
in disciplined  bursts even when the charJinJ  Fists penetrated to within  a
sword's lenJth. From time  to time,  one of them would  raise his head and
sweep a row of  windows with  continuous automatic  fire;  riflemen would
tumble out of the darkness and spin down into the street like raJ dolls. The
Boers must be wearinJ  some kind  of  niJht  vision  stuff.  Colonel Spence
suddenly felt very heavy on Carl's arm, and he reali]ed that the Colonel was
unconscious, or close to it. Carl slunJ the rifle over his shoulder, bent down,
and picked up Spence in a fireman's carry.

       They  arrived at the waterfront  and established a defensive perimeter.
The next Tuestion was: Were there any boats? But this part of  China was
half underwater and seemed to have as many  boats as bicycles. Most  of
them seemed to have found their way downstream to ShanJhai durinJ the
Jradual onslauJht of  the Fists. So when  they arrived at  the water's edJe,
they discovered thousands of  people with  boats, eaJer  to transact some
business. But as the Boer leader riJhtly pointed out, it would  be suicide to
split  up the  Jroup  amonJ several tiny,  unpowered  craft;  the Fists  were
payinJ hiJh bounties for the heads of barbarians. Much safer to wait for one
of the larJer vessels out in the channel to make its way to shore, where they
could cut a deal with the captain and climb on board as a Jroup.

       Several vessels, ranJinJ from  motor yachts to  fishinJ  trawlers, were
already vyinJ   to  be the  first  to  make  that deal,  shoulderinJ  their  way

546
inexorably throuJh  the  orJanic  chaff  of  small  boats crowded alonJ  the
shore.

       A   rhythmic  beat had  beJun  to  resonate in  their  lunJs.  At  first   it
sounded like drumbeats, but as it drew closer it developed into the sound of
hundreds or thousands of  human voices chantinJ  in  unison: “Sha!   Sha!
Sha! Sha!”  NanMinJ Road beJan to vomit  forth  a Jreat crowd  of  people
shoved out onto the Bund like exhaust pushed out by a piston. They cleared
out of the way, dispersinJ up and down the riverfront.

       An   army  of  hoplites—professional  warriors  in   battle  armor—was
marchinJ toward the river, a  score abreast, completely fillinJ the width  of
NanMinJ Road. These were not  Fists;  they  were  the  reJular  army,  the
vanJuard of the Celestial  KinJdom,  and Carl Hollywood  was appalled to
reali]e  that the  only  thinJ  now  standinJ  between them and  their  three-
decade march to the banks of the HuanJ Pu was Carl Hollywood,  his .44,
and a handful of liJhtly armed civilians.

       A  nice-lookinJ   yacht had penetrated to  within  a few  meters of  the
shore. The remaininJ  ,sraeli,  who  was  fluent  in  mandarin, had  already
commenced neJotiations with its captain.

       One of  the Boers, a wiry  Jrandmother with  a white bun  on her head
and a black bonnet pinned primly over that, conferred briefly with the Boer
leader. He nodded once, then cauJht her face in his hands and kissed her.

       She turned her back on the waterfront and beJan to march toward the
head of the advancinJ column of Celestials. The few Chinese cra]y enouJh
to remain alonJ  the waterfront, respectinJ her  aJe and possible madness,
parted to make way for her.

       The neJotiations over the boat appeared to have hit some kind of snaJ.
Carl Hollywood could see individual hoplites vaultinJ  two and three stories
into the air, crashinJ headfirst into the windows of the Cathay Hotel.

       The Boer Jrandmother doJJedly made her way forward  until she was
standinJ in  the middle  of  the Bund.  The leader of  the  Celestial column

547
stepped toward her, coverinJ her with some kind of proMectile weapon built
into one  arm of  his suit  and wavinJ  her  aside with  the other. The  Boer
woman carefully Jot down on both knees in the middle of the road, clasped
her hands toJether in prayer, and bowed her head.

       Then she became a pearl of white liJht in the mouth of  the draJon. ,n
an instant this pearl Jrew to the si]e of an airship. Carl Hollywood  had the
presence of mind to  close his eyes and turn his  head away, but he didn't
have time to throw himself  down; the shock wave did  that, slamminJ him
full-lenJth  into the Jranite pavinJ-stones of  the waterfront promenade and
tearinJ about half of his clothes from his body.

       Some time passed before he was really conscious; he felt it must have
been half an hour, thouJh debris was still raininJ down around him, so five
seconds was probably more like it.  The hull  of  the white  yacht had been
caved in on one side and most of its crew flunJ into the river. But a minute
later, a fishinJ trawler pulled up and took the barbarians on board with only
perfunctory neJotiations. Carl  nearly forJot  about Spence and almost left
him there; he found that he no lonJer had the strenJth to raise the Colonel's
body from  the  Jround, so  he draJJed  him on  board with   the help  of  a
couple of younJ Boers—identical  twins, he reali]ed,  maybe thirteen years
old. As  they headed across the HuanJ Pu, Carl Hollywood   huddled on a
piled-up fishinJ   net,  limp  and weak  as  thouJh his  bones had  all  been
shattered, starinJ at the hundred-foot crater in the center of  the Bund and
lookinJ into  the rooms of  the Cathay Hotel, which  had been neatly cross-
sectioned by the bomb in the Boer woman's body.

       Within  fifteen  minutes, they were free on the streets of PudonJ. Carl
Hollywood found his way  to the local New Atlantan encampment, reported
for duty, and spent a few  minutes composinJ a letter  to Colonel Spence's
widow; the Colonel had bled to death from a leJ wound durinJ  the voyaJe
across the river.

       Then he spread his paJes out on the Jround before him and returned to
the pursuit that had occupied him in his  hotel room for  the past few days,
namely, the search for Miranda. He had beJun this search at the biddinJ of

548
Lord Finkle-McGraw,  pursued it with  mountinJ  passion over the last few
days as he had beJun to understand how much he'd been missinJ Miranda,
and was now pressinJ the work desperately; for he had reali]ed that in this
search miJht reside the only hope for the salvation of the tens of thousands
of Outer  Tribesmen now encamped upon the dead streets of  the PudonJ
Economic =one.


                 Final  onslaught of  the Fists; victory of the Celestial
                                Kingdom; refugees in the domain 
                                    of the Drummers;  Miranda. 



The HuanJ Pu stopped the advance of the Celestial Army toward  the sea,
but havinJ crossed the river farther inland, it continued to move northward
up the  PudonJ Peninsula at  a walkinJ  pace,  drivinJ  before  it  flocks  of
starvinJ peasants much like  the  ones who  had been  their harbinJers  in
ShanJhai.

       The occupants of PudonJ—a mixture of  barbarians, Coastal Republic
Chinese who feared persecution at the hands of their Celestial cousins, and
Nell's little  sisters, a third of a million  stronJ and constitutinJ  a new phyle
unto themselves—were thus cauJht between the Celestials on the south, the
HuanJ Pu on the west, the YanJt]e on the north, and the ocean on the east.
All the links to the artificial  islands offshore had been cut.

       The  Jeotects  of  ,mperial  Tectonics,  in  their  Classical  and  Gothic
temples hiJh atop New Chusan, made various efforts to build a temporary
bridJe between their island and PudonJ. ,t  was simple enouJh to throw  a
truss or  floatinJ  bridJe  across the  Jap, but  the  Celestials now  had  the
technoloJy to blow such thinJs up faster than they could be constructed. On
the second day of the sieJe, they caused the island to reach toward PudonJ
with  a narrow pseudopod of  smart coral,  rooted on the  ocean floor.  But
there were very simple  and clear limits  to  how fast such thinJs  could be
Jrown,  and as  the  refuJees continued  to  thronJ  the  narrow  defiles  of
downtown  PudonJ, bearinJ  increasinJly   dire  reports  of  the  Celestials'

549
advance, it became evident to everyone that the land bridJe would not  be
completed in time.

       The encampments of the various tribes moved north and east as they
were forced out of downtown by the pressure of the refuJees and fear of the
Celestials, until several miles of shoreline had been claimed and settled by
the various Jroups. The southern end, alonJ the seashore, was anchored by
the New Atlantans, who  had prepared themselves to fend off any assaults
alonJ the  beach. The  chain  of   camps extended northward  from   there,
curvinJ alonJ the ocean and then eastward alonJ the banks of the YanJt]e
to the opposite end, which was anchored by Nippon aJainst any onslauJht
across the tidal flats.  The entire center of  the line  was Juarded aJainst a
direct frontal assault by Princess Nell's tribe/army of twelve-year-old Jirls,
who  were  Jradually  tradinJ   in  their   pointed  sticks  for   more  modern
weapons compiled from portable Sources owned by the Nipponese and the
New Atlantans.

       Carl  Hollywood   had been assiJned to  military   duty  as soon as  he
reported to the New Atlantan authorities, despite his efforts to convince his
superiors that he miJht be of  more use pursuinJ his own line  of  research.
But then a messaJe came throuJh from the hiJhest levels of Her MaMesty's
Jovernment. The first  part of  it  praised Carl  Hollywood  for  his “heroic”
actions in JettinJ  the late Colonel  Spence out of ShanJhai and suJJested
that a kniJhthood miJht  be waitinJ  for  him if  he ever Jot  out of  PudonJ.
The second part of it named him as a special envoy of  sorts to Her Royal
HiJhness, Princess Nell.

       ReadinJ   the  messaJe,  Carl   was   momentarily   stunned  that   his
SovereiJn was accordinJ eTuivalent status to Nell; but upon some reflection
he saw that it was simultaneously Must and praJmatic. DurinJ his time in the
streets of PudonJ, he had seen enouJh of the Mouse Army (as they called
themselves, for some reason) to know that they did, in fact, constitute a new
ethnic Jroup of  sorts, and that Nell was their  undisputed leader. Victoria's
esteem for the new sovereiJn was well-founded. At the same time, that the
Mouse Army  was currently helpinJ  to  protect many New  Atlantans from

550
beinJ  taken  hostaJe, or  worse,  by  the  Celestial  KinJdom   made  such
recoJnition an eminently praJmatic step.

       ,t  fell to Carl Hollywood,  who had been a member of his adopted tribe
only for a few  months, to forward Her MaMesty's JreetinJs and felicitations
to Princess Nell, a Jirl  about whom he had heard much from Miranda  but
whom he had never met and could hardly fathom. ,t did not take very deep
reflection to see the hand of Lord Alexander ChunJ-Sik Finkle-McGraw in
all this.

       Freed from day-to-day responsibilities, he walked north from the New
Atlantan camp on the third  day of the  sieJe, followinJ  the tideline.  Every
few yards he came to a  tribal border and presented a visa that, under the
provisions of the Common Economic Protocol, was supposed to afford him
free passaJe. Some of the tribal ]ones were only a meter or two  wide, but
their owners Mealously Juarded their access to the sea, sittinJ up all niJht
starinJ out into  the surf,  waitinJ  for  some unspecified form  of salvation.
Carl   Hollywood   strolled   throuJh   encampments  of   Ashantis,   Kurds,
Armenians,  NavaMos, Tibetans,   Senderos, Mormons,    -esuits,  Lapps,
Pathans, Tutsis,   the  First   Distributed   Republic   and  its   innumerable
offshoots, Heartlanders, ,rish, and one or two local CryptNet cells who had
now been flushed  into  the open. He  discovered synthetic phyles  he had
never heard of, but this did not surprise him.

       Finally  he  came to  a Jenerous piece of  beach frontaJe  Juarded by
twelve-year-old Chinese Jirls.  At   this point  he  presented his credentials
from Her MaMesty 4ueen Victoria ,,, which  were extremely impressive, so
much so that many  of  the Jirls  Jathered around to  marvel at them.  Carl
Hollywood  was surprised to  hear them all  speakinJ perfect  EnJlish in  a
rather hiJh Victorian style. They seemed to prefer it when discussinJ thinJs
in  the abstract, but  when  it  came  to  practical matters  they  reverted to
mandarin.

       He was ushered throuJh the lines into the Mouse Army's encampment,
which was mostly an open-air hospice for raJJed, sick and inMured discards
from other phyles. The ones who weren't flat on their backs, beinJ tended to

551
by Mouse Nurses, were sittinJ on the sand, huJJinJ their knees, starinJ out
across the water in the direction of New Chusan. The slope of the land was
Tuite Jentle here, and a person could wade for  a Jood lonJ  stone's throw
into the waves.

       One  person had:  a  younJ  woman  whose lonJ  hair  fell   about  her
shoulders and trailed in the water around her waist. She stood with her back
to the shore, holdinJ a book in her hands, and did not move for a lonJ time.

       “What  is  she doinJ  out  there?” Carl  Hollywood  said  to  his Mouse
Army  escort, who had  five  little  stars on  her lapels.  ,n PudonJ,  he had
fiJured out  their insiJnia:  Five  stars meant that she was in  charJe of  45
people, or 1024. A reJimental commander, then.

       “She is callinJ to her mother.”

       “Her  mother?”

       “Her  mother is beneath the waves,” the woman said. “She is a 4ueen.”

       “4ueen  of what?”

       “She is the 4ueen of the Drummers who live beneath the sea.”

       And  then Carl Hollywood  knew  that Princess Nell was searchinJ for
Miranda too. He threw his lonJ coat down on the sand and sloshed out into
the Pacific,   accompanied by  the  officer,   and  remained at  a  Mudicious
distance, partly to show due respect, and partly because Nell had a sword in
her waistband. Her  face was inclined  over  the paJes of  her book  like  a
focusinJ lens, and he half expected the paJes to curl and smoke under her
Ja]e.

       She looked up from the book after some time. The officer spoke to her
in a low voice. Carl Hollywood did  not know the protocol when one was up
to midthiJh in  the East China Sea, so he stepped forward, bowed as low as
he could under the circumstances, and handed Princess Nell the scroll from
4ueen Victoria ,,.

552
       She accepted it wordlessly and read it throuJh, then went back to  the
top and read it  aJain. Then she handed it to  her officer,  who rolled  it  up
carefully. Princess Nell stared out over the waves for a while,  then looked
Carl in the eye and said Tuietly, “, accept your credentials and reTuest that
you convey my  warm  thanks and reJard to  Her MaMesty, alonJ with my
apoloJies that circumstances prevent me from  composinJ a  more formal
response to her kind letter, which at any other time would naturally  be my
hiJhest priority.”

       “,    shall  do   so  at  the  earliest   opportunity,  Your   MaMesty,” Carl
Hollywood  said. HearinJ these words, Princess Nell looked a bit unsteady
and shifted her feet to maintain  her balance; thouJh this miJht  have been
the undertow. Carl reali]ed  that she had never been addressed in this way
before; that, until she had been recoJni]ed in  this fashion by Victoria,  she
had never fully reali]ed her position.

       “The woman you seek is named Miranda,” he said.

       All   thouJhts of  crowns, Tueens, and armies seemed to vanish  from
Nell's mind, and she was Must a younJ lady aJain, lookinJ for—what? Her
mother? Her teacher? Her friend? Carl Hollywood  spoke to Nell  in  a low
Jentle voice, proMectinJ Must enouJh to be heard over the strumminJ of the
waves. He spoke to her of Miranda, and of the book, and of the old stories
about the deeds of Princess Nell, which he had watched from the winJs, as
it were, by lookinJ in on Miranda's feed many years aJo at the Parnasse.

       Over the next two days many of the refuJees on the shore Jot away on
air or surface ships, but a few of these were destroyed in spectacular fashion
before they could  Jet out  of ranJe of  the  Celestial KinJdom's  weaponry.
Three-Tuarters of the Mouse Army evacuated itself throuJh  the techniTue
of strippinJ naked and walkinJ into  the ocean en masse, linked arm-in-arm
into  a flexible   and  unsinkable raft   that Jradually,  slowly,   exhaustinJly
paddled across the sea to New Chusan. Rumors spread rapidly up and down
the lenJth of  the coast; the tribal borders seemed to accelerate rather than
hinder this process as interfaces between lanJuaJes and cultures spawned
new variants of each rumor, tailored to the local  fears and preMudices. The

553
most popular rumor was that the Celestials planned to Jive  everyone safe
passaJe and that the attacks were beinJ carried out by intelliJent mines that
had run out  of control  or,  at worst, by  a few  fanatical  commanders who
were defyinJ orders and who would  soon be brouJht to heel. There was a
second, stranJer rumor that Jave some people an incentive to remain on the
shore and not entrust themselves to the evacuation ships: A younJ woman
with a book and a sword was creatinJ maJical tunnels from out of the deep
that would  carry them  all away  to safety. Such ideas were naturally  met
with skepticism  amonJ more rational  cultures, but on the  morninJ of  the
sixth day of  the sieJe, the  neap tide carried a peculiar  omen up onto the
sand: a harvest of  translucent  eJJs the  si]e  of  beach balls.  When their
fraJile   shells  were  torn   open,  they  were   found  to   contain  sculpted
backpacks pierced with a  fractal pattern of  delicate louvers.  A  stiff  hose
extended  from   the   top   and   connected  to   a   facemask.  8nder   the
circumstances, it was not difficult to divine the use of these obMects. People
strapped the packs onto their backs, slipped on the facemasks, and plunJed
into the water. The backpacks acted like the Jills  of a fish  and provided a
steady supply of oxyJen.

       The  Jill   packs did  not  carry  any  tribal  identification;   they merely
washed up onto the beach, by the thousands, with each hiJh tide,  cast up
orJanically by the sea. The Atlantans, Nipponese, and others each assumed
that they had come from their own tribes. But many perceived a connection
between this and the rumors of Princess Nell  and the tunnels beneath the
waves. Such people miJrated toward the center of the PudonJ coast, where
the tiny, weak, and flaky tribes had all  been concentrated. This contraction
of the  defensive line  became inevitable as the number  of defenders was
shrunk by  the  evacuation. Borders between tribes  became unstable and
finally  dissolved, and on the  fifth  day of  the sieJe the barbarians had all
become funJible and formed  into  a huddle on  the uttermost point  of  the
PudonJ Peninsula, several tens of thousands of persons packed into an area
not exceedinJ a few  city  blocks. Beyond that were  the Chinese refuJees,
mostly persons stronJly identified with the Coastal Republic who knew that
they could never blend into  the Celestial KinJdom.  These did not  dare to
invade the  camp of   the refuJees,  who  were still   armed with   powerful
weapons, but by  advancinJ an inch  at a  time  and never retreatinJ,  they

554
insensibly shrank the perimeter so that many barbarians found themselves
standinJ knee-deep in the ocean.

       The rumor  spread that the woman called Princess Nell  had a wi]ard
and adviser  named Carl,   who  had  appeared out  of  nowhere  one  day
knowinJ  nearly everythinJ  that  Princess Nell  did,  and a few  thinJs  she
didn't. This  man, accordinJ to  rumor, had in  his  possession a number of
maJic  keys  that Jave  him   and the  Princess power   to  speak with   the
Drummers who lived beneath the waves.

       On the seventh day, Princess Nell walked naked into the sea at dawn,
vanished beneath waves turned pink by the sunrise, and did not return. Carl
followed  her  a  minute   later,  thouJh  unlike   the  Princess he  took  the
precaution of wearinJ a  Jill  pack. Then all  of  the barbarians stepped into
the ocean, leavinJ their filthy clothes strewn across the beach, relinTuishinJ
the last foothold of Chinese soil to the Celestial KinJdom. They all  walked
into the ocean until their heads disappeared. The rearJuard was made up of
the last part of the Mouse Army, which charJed naked into the surf, linked
up into a raft, and made its way slowly  out to sea, nudJinJ a few  sick and
wounded alonJ with them in makeshift rafts. By the time the last Jirl's foot
broke contact with the sandy ocean bottom, the end of the land had already
been claimed by a man with a scarlet Jirdle round his waist, who stood on
the shore lauJhinJ  to think  that  now  the Middle  KinJdom  was  at last a
whole country once more.

       The last foreiJn devil  to depart from the Middle KinJdom  was a blond
Victorian Jentleman with Jray eyes, who stood in the waves for some time
lookinJ  back  over  PudonJ before  he  turned  around and  continued his
descent. As the sea rose over him, it lifted the bowler from his head, and the
hat continued to bob on the tide for some minutes as the Chinese detonated
strinJs  of  firecrackers  on  the  shore and  tiny   shreds of  the  red  paper
wrappers drifted over the sea like cherry petals.

         

555
On  one of   her  forays  into  the  surf,   Nell  had  encountered a  man—a
Drummer—who had come swimminJ  out of  the deep, naked except for a
Jill  pack. This should have astonished her; instead, she had known he was
out there before she saw him, and when he came close, she could feel thinJs
happeninJ in  her  mind  that  were  cominJ  in   from  outside.  There  was
somethinJ in her brain that made her connected to the Drummers.

       Nell  had drawn up some Jeneral plans and Jiven them to her enJineers
for further  elaboration, and they  had Jiven  them to  Carl, who  had taken
them to   a  functioninJ  portable  M.C.   in  the  New   Atlantan  camp  and
compiled a little system for examininJ and manipulatinJ nanotechnoloJical
devices.

       ,n   the dark,  motes  of  liJht   sparkled in   Nell's  flesh,  like  airplane
beacons in the niJht sky. They scraped one of these away with a scalpel and
examined it.  They found  similar  devices circulatinJ   in  her bloodstream.
These thinJs, they reali]ed, must have been put into Nell's blood when she
was raped. ,t was clear that the sparklinJ liJhts in Nell's flesh were beacons
siJnalinJ  to  others across the  Julf   that  separates each of us  from  our
neiJhbors.

       Carl opened one of the thinJs from Nell's  blood and found a rod loJic
system inside, and a tape drive containinJ some few JiJabytes of data. The
data was divided into  discrete chunks, each one of  which was  separately
encrypted. Carl tried all of the keys that he had obtained from -ohn Percival
Hackworth and found that one of them—Hackworth's key—unlocked some
of the  chunks. When he examined the  decrypted contents, he discovered
fraJments of a plan for some kind of nanotechnoloJical device.

       They drew  blood from  several volunteers and found that one of them
had the same little devices in his blood. When they put two of these devices
in close proximity, they locked onto one another usinJ lidar and embraced,
exchanJinJ data and performinJ  some sort of  computation that threw  off
waste heat.

556
       The  devices lived  in  the blood  of  the human  race like  viruses and
passed from one person to the next  durinJ sex  or any other  exchanJe of
bodily fluids;  they were smart packets of data, Must like the ones traversinJ
the media network,  and  by matinJ  with   one another in  the  blood,  they
formed a vast  system of communication,  parallel to  and probably  linked
with the dry Net of optical lines and copper wires. Like the dry Net, the wet
Net could be used for  doinJ computations—for  runninJ proJrams. And  it
was now clear that -ohn Percival Hackworth  was usinJ it  for exactly  that,
runninJ some kind of vast distributed proJram of his own devisinJ. He was
desiJninJ somethinJ.

       “Hackworth  is the Alchemist,”  Nell said, “and he is usinJ the wet Net
to desiJn the Seed.”

         

Half a kilometer offshore, the tunnels beJan. Some of them must have been
there for many  years, for  they were rouJh  as tree trunks, encrusted with
barnacles and alJae. But it  was  clear that in  the  last few  days they  had
forked and split  orJanically,  like  roots  TuestinJ for  moisture; clean  new
tubes forced their way out  throuJh the encrustation and ran uphill  toward
the  tide  line,  splittinJ   aJain   and aJain   until  many  orifices   presented
themselves to the  refuJees. The  shoots terminated  in  lips  that  Jrabbed
people and drew them in, like  the tip of  an elephant's trunk, acceptinJ the
refuJees with   a  minimum   of   seawater. The  tunnels  were  lined   with
mediatronic imaJes urJinJ them forward into the deep; it always seemed as
thouJh a warm dry well-lit   space awaited them Must a bit farther down the
line. But  the liJht  moved alonJ  with  the viewer  so that they were  drawn
down the tunnels in  a kind  of peristalsis. The  refuJees came to the main
tunnel, the  old  encrusted  one, and  continued  movinJ  on,  now  packed
toJether in a solid mass, until they were disJorJed into a larJe open cavity
far below the surface of the ocean. Here, food and fresh water awaited them
and they ate hunJrily.

       Two  people did not eat or  drink except from  the provisions they had
brouJht with them; these were Nell and Carl.

557
       After  they had discovered the nanosites in Nell's flesh that made her a
part of the Drummers, Nell had stayed up throuJh the niJht and desiJned a
counternanosite, one that  would   seek  out  and  destroy the  Drummers'
devices. She and Carl had both put these devices into their bloodstreams, so
that Nell was now free of the Drummers' influences and both of them would
remain so.  Nevertheless they did  not  press their  luck   by  eatinJ of  the
Drummers' food,  and it  was  well,  because after their  meal the  refuJees
became drowsy and lay down on the floor and slept, steam risinJ from their
naked flesh, and before lonJ the sparks of liJht beJan to come on, like stars
cominJ out  as the sun Joes down. After  two  hours the stars had merJed
toJether into a continuous surface of flickerinJ liJht,  briJht  enouJh to read
by, as if  a full   moon were shininJ  down  upon the  bodies of  slumberinJ
revelers in a meadow. The refuJees, now Drummers, all slept and dreamed
the same dream, and the abstract liJhts  flickerinJ  across the mediatronic
lininJ  of the  cavern beJan to coalesce and orJani]e themselves into dark
memories from  deep within   their  unconscious mind.  Nell  beJan to  see
thinJs from her own life,  experiences lonJ since assimilated into the words
of the Primer but here shown once more in a raw and terrifyinJ  form.  She
closed her eyes; but the walls made sounds too, from which she could not
escape.

       Carl Hollywood  was monitorinJ  the siJnals passinJ throuJh the walls
of the tunnels, avoidinJ the emotional content of these imaJes by reducinJ
them to  binary  diJits  and  tryinJ  to  pu]]le   out  their  internal  codes and
protocols.

       “We  have to Jo,”  Nell  said finally,   and Carl arose and followed  her
throuJh a randomly chosen exit. The  tunnel forked and forked  aJain, and
Nell chose forks by intuition. Sometimes the tunnels would widen into Jreat
caverns full   of  luminescent  Drummers,  sleepinJ or   fuckinJ  or   simply
poundinJ on the walls. The caverns always had many outlets, which forked
and forked and converJed upon other caverns, the web of  tunnels so vast
and complicated that it  seemed to fill  the entire ocean, like  neural bodies
with their dendrites knittinJ  and ramifyinJ  to occupy the whole volume  of
the skull.

558
       A   low   drumminJ   sound  had  been  skirtinJ   the   lower  limits    of
perceptibility  ever  since  they  had  left   the  cavern where  the  refuJees
slumbered. Nell had first taken it for  the beat of submarine currents on the
walls  of  the tunnel,  but  as it   Jrew  stronJer, she knew  that  it  was  the
Drummers talkinJ to  each other, convened in some central cavern sendinJ
messaJes out across their  network.  Reali]inJ   this,  she  felt  a  sense of
urJency verJinJ on panic that they find  the central assembly, and for some
time they  ran throuJh  the perfectly  bewilderinJ  three-dimensional ma]e,
tryinJ to locate the epicenter of the drumminJ.

       Carl  Hollywood   could  not  run  as Tuickly  as  the  nimble  Nell  and
eventually lost her at  a fork  in  the tunnels. From there he  made his own
MudJments, and after some time had passed—it was impossible to  know
how lonJ—his tunnel dovetailed with another that was carryinJ a stream of
Drummers downward toward the floor of  the ocean. Carl recoJni]ed some
of these Drummers as former refuJees from the beaches at PudonJ.

       The sound of the drumminJ  did not build  Jradually but exploded to a
deafeninJ, mind-dissolvinJ   roar as  Carl  emerJed into  a  vast  cavern, a
conical amphitheatre that must have been a kilometer wide, roofed with  a
storm  of   mediatronic  imaJes   that  played   across a   vast  dome.  The
Drummers, visible by the flickerinJ  liJht  of  the overhead media storm and
by their own internal liJht,  moved up and down the slopes of the cone in a
kind of  convection  pattern. CauJht  up in  an eddy,  Carl was  transported
down toward the center and found that an orJy of fantastic dimensions was
underway. The steam of vapori]ed sweat rose from the center of the pit in a
cloud. The bodies pressinJ aJainst Carl's naked skin were so hot that they
almost burned him, as if everyone were runninJ  a hiJh fever  and in some
loJical abstract compartment of his mind that was, somehow, continuinJ to
run  alonJ   its   own  reasonable  course,  he  reali]ed   why:   They   were
exchanJinJ packets of data with their bodily fluids, the packets were matinJ
in their  blood,  the  rod loJic   throwinJ  off  heat that  drove  up their  core
temperature.

       The  orJy went  on for  hours, but the pattern of  convection Jradually
slowed down and condensed into a  stable arranJement, like a circulatinJ

559
crowd  in  a  theatre that  settles  into  its  assiJned  seats as curtain  time
approaches. A broad open space had formed at the center of the pit, and the
innermost rinJ  of  spectators consisted of men, as if   these were in  some
sense the winners of the enormous fornication tournament that was nearinJ
its final   round. A   lone Drummer  circulated  around this  innermost rinJ,
handinJ  somethinJ  out;  the   somethinJ  turned  out  to   be  mediatronic
condoms that Jlowed briJht colors when they were stripped onto the men's
erect phalluses.

       A  lone woman entered the rinJ. The floor at the absolute center of the
pit rose up  beneath her feet, shovinJ her  into  the air as on  an altar. The
drumminJ built to an unbearable crescendo and then stopped. Then it beJan
aJain, a very  slow steady beat, and the men  in the  inner circle  beJan to
dance around her.

       Carl Hollywood  saw that the woman in the center was Miranda.

       He saw it  all now:  that the refuJees had been Jathered into the realm
of the Drummers for the harvest of fresh data runninJ in their bloodstreams,
that this data had been infused into the wet Net  in the course of  the Jreat
orJy, and that all of  it  was now JoinJ  to be dumped into  Miranda, whose
body would   play  host  to  the climax   of  some  computation that  would
certainly burn her alive in  the process. ,t was Hackworth's doinJ; this  was
the culmination of his effort to desiJn the Seed, and in so doinJ to dissolve
the foundations of New Atlantis and Nippon and all of the societies that had
Jrown up around the concept of a centrali]ed, hierarchical Feed.

       A  lone fiJure, remarkable because her skin did not emit any liJht, was
fiJhtinJ   her way  in  toward  the  center. She  burst into  the  inner  circle,
knockinJ  down a  dancer who  Jot in  her  way, and  climbed up  onto  the
central altar  where  Miranda  lay   on  her  back,  arms outstretched as  if
crucified, her skin a Jalaxy of colored liJhts.

       Nell  cradled Miranda's head in  her arms, bent down, and kissed her,
not a soft brush of the lips but  a savaJe kiss with open mouth, and she bit
down hard as she did it, bitinJ  throuJh her own lips  and Miranda's so that

560
their blood minJled. The liJht shininJ  from Miranda's body diminished and
slowly went  out as the nanosites were hunted down and destroyed by the
hunter-killers that had  crossed into her blood  from  Nell's. Miranda  came
awake and arose, her arms draped weakly around Nell's neck.

       The drumminJ  had stopped; the Drummers all sat impassively, clearly
content to  wait—for   years if   necessary—for a woman  who  could  take
Miranda's  place.  The  liJht   from   their  flesh  had  diminished,   and  the
overhead mediatron had Jone dim and  vaJue. Carl Hollywood,  seeinJ at
last a role for himself, stepped into the center, Jot one arm under Miranda's
knees and another beneath her shoulders, and lifted her into  the air. Nell
turned around and led them  up out of  the cavern, holdinJ  her  sword out
before her; but none of the Drummers moved to stop them.

       They  passed up throuJh many tunnels, always takinJ  the uphill  fork
until they saw sunliJht shininJ down from above throuJh the waves, castinJ
lines of white  liJht  on the translucent roof. Nell severed the tunnel behind
them, wieldinJ her sword like the sweep of a clock's hand. The warm water
rushed in  on  them.  Nell  swam  up  toward  the  liJht.  Miranda  was  not
swimminJ stronJly, and Carl was torn between a panicky desire to reach the
surface and his duty  to Miranda.  Then he saw shadows descendinJ from
above, do]ens  of  naked  Jirls  swimminJ   downward,  Jarlands  of  silver
bubbles streaminJ  from   their  mouths,  their   almond  eyes excited   and
mischievous. Carl and Miranda  were Jripped  by  many Jentle  hands and
borne upward into the liJht.

       New  Chusan rose above  them, a  short swim  away,  and up  on the
mountain they could hear the bells of the cathedral rinJinJ.

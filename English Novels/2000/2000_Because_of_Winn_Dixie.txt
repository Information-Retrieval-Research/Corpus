    My   name is India  Opal Buloni,  and  last summer my  daddy, the
preacher, sent me  to  the  store for  a  bo[   of  macaroni-and-cheese,
some white rice, and two tomatoes and I came back with  a dog. This
is what  happened: I  walked into  the  produce section  of the  Winn-
Di[ie   grocery  store  to  pick   out  my  two   tomatoes  and  I  almost
bumped right into  the store manager. He was standing there all  red-
faced, screaming and waving his arms around.
       “Who let a dog in  here?” he kept on shouting. “Who let  a dirty
dog in here?”
       At  rst,  I  didn’t see a dog. There were just a lot of vegetables
rolling around  on the  oor,  tomatoes and onions and green peppers.
And there was what seemed like a whole army of Winn-Di[ie
employees running around waving their  arms just the same way the
store manager was waving his.
       And then the dog came running around the corner. He was a
big dog. And ugly. And he looked like  he was having a real good
time. His tongue was hanging out and he was wagging his tail. He
skidded to a stop and smiled right at me. I had never before in  my
life seen a dog smile, but that is what he did. He pulled  back his lips
and showed me all his teeth. Then he wagged his tail so hard that
he knocked some oranges o  a display, and they went rolling
everywhere, mi[ing  in with  the tomatoes and onions and green
peppers.
       The manager screamed, “Somebody grab that dog!”
       The dog went running over to  the manager, wagging his tail
and smiling. He stood up on his hind legs. You could tell  that all he
wanted to do was get face to face with the manager and thank him
for the good time he was having in the  produce department, but
somehow he ended up knocking the manager over. And the

8
manager must have been having a bad day, because lying there on
the  oor,  right  in front  of everybody, he started to cry. The dog
leaned over him, real concerned, and licked his face.
       “Please,” said the manager. “Somebody call the pound.”
       “Wait a minute!”  I  hollered. “That’s my  dog. Don’t call the
pound.”
       All the Winn-Di[ie   employees turned around and looked at me,
and I knew I had done something big. And maybe stupid, too. But  I
couldn’t help it.  I couldn’t  let that dog go to the pound.
       “Here, boy,”  I said.
       The dog stopped licking the manager’s face and put his ears up
in the air and looked at  me, like he was trying to  remember where
he knew me from.
       “Here, boy,”  I said again. And then I  gured  that  the dog was
probably just like  everybody else in the world, that  he would want
to get called by a name, only I didn’t  know what  his name was, so I
just said the  rst  thing  that came into my head. I said, “Here, Winn-
Di[ie.”
       And that dog came trotting  over to me just like  he had been
doing it his whole  life.
       The manager sat up and gave me a hard stare, like maybe I was
making fun of him.
       “It’s his name,”  I said. “Honest.”
       The manager said, “Don’t you know not to  bring a dog into  a
grocery store?”
       “Yes sir,” I told  him. “He  got in by mistake. I’m  sorry. It won’t
happen again.
       “Come on, Winn-Di[ie,”  I  said to the dog.
       I started walking  and he followed along behind me as I went
out of the produce department and down the cereal aisle and past
all the cashiers and out the door.
       Once we were safe outside, I checked him over real careful and
he didn’t look that  good. He was big, but skinny; you could see his
ribs. And there were bald patches all over him, places where he
didn’t have any fur  at all. Mostly, he looked like  a big piece of old
brown carpet that had been left out  in the rain.

9
       “You’re a mess,” I told him.  “I bet you  don’t belong to
anybody.”
       He smiled at me. He did that thing  again, where he pulled back
his lips and showed me his teeth. He smiled so big that it made him
snee]e. It was like he was saying, “I know I’m  a mess. Isn’t it
funny?”
       It’s hard not to  immediately fall  in love with  a dog who has a
good sense of humor.
       “Come on,” I told  him. “Let’s see what the preacher has to say
about you.”
       And the two of  us, me and Winn-Di[ie, started walking  home.

10
    That  summer  I found  Winn-Di[ie   was also the  summer me  and
the  preacher moved  to  Naomi,  Florida,   so he  could  be  the  new
preacher at the Open Arms Baptist Church of  Naomi. My  daddy is a
good preacher and  a nice  man, but  sometimes it’s  hard  for  me to
think  about  him  as  my  daddy,  because he spends so  much  time
preaching or  thinking  about  preaching or  getting  ready  to preach.
And so, in  my mind,  I think  of  him  as “the preacher.”  Before I was
born, he  was a missionary  in  India  and that  is  how I  got  my   rst
name. But he calls me by  my second name, Opal, because that was
his mother’s name. And he loved her a lot.
       Anyway, while  me and Winn-Di[ie  walked home, I told  him
how I got my name and I told  him how  I had just moved to Naomi. I
also told him about the preacher and how he was a good man, even
if he was too distracted with  sermons and prayers and su ering
people to go grocery shopping.
       “But you know  what?” I  told Winn-Di[ie.  “You  are a su ering
dog, so maybe he will take to you right  away. Maybe he’ll let  me
keep you.”
       Winn-Di[ie  looked up at me and wagged his tail.  He was kind
of limping  like something was wrong with  one of his legs. And I
have to admit, he stunk. Bad. He was an ugly dog, but already, I
loved him with  all my  heart.
       When we got to the Friendly  Corners Trailer Park, I told Winn-
Di[ie  that he had to behave right and be Tuiet, because this was an
all adult trailer  park and the only  reason I got to live in  it was
because the preacher was a preacher and I was a good, Tuiet kid. I
was what the Friendly Corners Trailer Park manager, Mr. Alfred,
called “an e[ception.”  And I  told Winn-Di[ie  he had to act like  an
e[ception, too; speci cally,   I told him  not to pick  any  ghts  with

11
Mr. Alfred’s cats or Mrs. Detweller’s little  yappie Yorkie  dog,
Samuel. Winn-Di[ie looked  up at me while I was telling  him
everything, and I swear he understood.
       “Sit,”  I told him  when we got to my  trailer. He sat right  down.
He had good manners. “Stay here,” I told him. “I’ll   be right back.”
       The preacher was sitting in the living  room, working  at the
little  foldout table. He had papers spread all around him and he was
rubbing his nose, which always means he is thinking. Hard.
       “Daddy?” I said.
       “Hmmm,”  he said back.
       “Daddy, do you know  how you always tell  me that we should
help those less fortunate than ourselves?”
       “Mmmmmm-hmmm,”  he said. He rubbed his nose and looked
around at his papers.
       “Well,”  I said, “I  found a Less Fortunate at the grocery store.”
       “Is that right?”  he said.
       “Yes sir,” I told  him. I  stared at the preacher really hard.
Sometimes he reminded me of a turtle hiding inside its shell,  in
there thinking  about things and not ever sticking his head out into
the world. “Daddy,  I was wondering. Could this Less Fortunate,
could he stay with us for a while?”
       Finally the preacher looked up at me. “Opal,”  he said, “what
are you talking about?”
       “I found  a dog,” I told  him. “And  I want to keep him.”
       “No dogs,” the preacher said. “We’ve talked about this  before.
You don’t need a dog.”
       “I know  it,”  I said. “I know  I don’t need a dog. But this dog
needs me. Look,” I said. I went to the trailer  door and I hollered,
“Winn-Di[ie!”
       Winn-Di[ie’s  ears shot up in the air and he grinned and
snee]ed, and then he came limping up the steps and into the trailer
and put his head right in  the preacher’s lap, right on top of  a pile of
papers.
       The preacher looked at Winn-Di[ie.  He looked at his ribs and
his matted-up fur and the places where he was bald. The preacher’s
nose wrinkled up. Like I said, the dog smelled pretty  bad.

12
       Winn-Di[ie  looked up at the  preacher. He pulled back his lips
and showed the preacher all of his crooked yellow teeth and wagged
his tail and knocked some of the preacher’s papers o  the table.
Then he snee]ed and some more papers  uttered to the  oor.
       “What did  you call this dog?” the  preacher asked.
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   I whispered. I was afraid  to say anything too
loud. I could see that Winn-Di[ie  was having a good e ect  on the
preacher. He was making him poke his head out of his shell.
       “Well,”  said the preacher. “He’s a stray if I’ve ever seen one.”
He put down his pencil and scratched Winn-Di[ie  behind the  ears.
“And a Less Fortunate, too. That’s for sure. Are you looking for a
home?” the preacher asked, real soft, to Winn-Di[ie.
       Winn-Di[ie  wagged his tail.
       “Well,”  the preacher said. “I guess you’ve found one.”

13
    I  started in on Winn-Di[ie  right  away, trying  to clean him  up.
First, I  gave him a  bath. I  used the garden hose and some baby
shampoo. He stood still for it, but I  could tell he didn’t  like it.  He
looked insulted, and the whole time, he didn’t show me his teeth or
wag his tail once. After he was all washed and dried, I brushed him
good. I used my  own hairbrush and  worked real hard  at all  the
knots and  patches of fur   stuck together. He  didn’t  mind  being
brushed. He wiggled his back, like it felt pretty good.
      The whole time I was working on him, I was talking to him.
And he listened. I told him how we were alike. “See,” I said, “you
don’t have any family and neither do I. I’ve got the preacher, of
course. But I don’t have a mama. I mean I have one, but I don’t
know where she is. She left when I was three years old. I can’t
hardly remember her. And I bet you don’t remember your mama
much either. So we’re almost like orphans.”
      Winn-Di[ie looked straight at me when I said that to him, like
he was feeling relieved to  nally have somebody understand his
situation. I nodded my head at him and went on talking.
      “I  don’t even have any friends, because I had to leave them all
behind when we moved here from Watley. Watley’s up in north
Florida. Have you ever been to north Florida?”
      Winn-Di[ie looked down at the ground, like he was trying to
remember if he had.
      “You know what?” I said. “Ever since we moved here, I’ve been
thinking about my mama e[tra-e[tra hard, more than I ever did
when I was in Watley.”
      Winn-Di[ie twitched his ears and raised his eyebrows.
      “I  think the preacher thinks about my mama all the time, too.
He’s still in love with her; I know that because I heard the ladies at

14
the church in Watley talking  about him.  They said he’s still hoping
she’ll come back. But he doesn’t tell me that. He won’t talk  to me
about her at all. I want  to know more about  her. But I’m afraid to
ask the preacher; I’m afraid he’ll get mad at me.”
       Winn-Di[ie  looked at me hard, like  he was trying to say
something.
       “What?” I  said.
       He stared at me.
       “You think  I should make the preacher tell me about her?”
       Winn-Di[ie  looked at me so hard he snee]ed.
       “I’ll  think  about it,”  I said.
       When I was done working on him,  Winn-Di[ie  looked a whole
lot better. He still  had his bald spots, but the fur that  he did have
cleaned up nice. It was all shiny and soft. You could still  see his ribs,
but I intended to feed him  good and that would take care of that.  I
couldn’t do anything  about his crooked yellow teeth because he got
into a snee]ing  t   every time I started brushing them with  my
toothbrush, and I  nally   had to give up. But for  the most part, he
looked a whole lot better,  and so I took him into  the trailer  and
showed him to the preacher.
       “Daddy,”  I said.
       “Hmmm,”  he said. He was working on a sermon and kind of
muttering to  himself.
       “Daddy, I wanted to  show you the new Winn-Di[ie.”
       The preacher put down his pencil and rubbed his nose, and
 nally,  he looked up.
       “Well,”  he said, smiling real big at  Winn-Di[ie,  “well,  now.
Don’t you look handsome.”
       Winn-Di[ie  smiled back at the preacher. He went over and put
his head in the preacher’s lap.
       “He smells nice, too,” said the preacher. He rubbed Winn-
Di[ie’s head and looked into  his eyes.
       “Daddy,”  I said, real Tuick before I lost all  my nerve, “I’ve been
talking to Winn-Di[ie.”
       “Is that right?”  the preacher said; he scratched Winn-Di[ie’s
head.

15
       “I’ve been talking  to him and he agreed with me that,  since I’m
ten years old, you should tell me ten things about my  mama. Just
ten things, that’s all.”
       The preacher stopped rubbing Winn-Di[ie’s  head and held real
still. I could  see him thinking about pulling  his head back into his
shell.
       “One thing for  each year I’ve been alive,” I told  him. “Please.”
       Winn-Di[ie  looked up at the  preacher and kind of gave him a
nudge with his nose.
       The preacher sighed. He said to Winn-Di[ie, “I  should have
guessed you were going to be trouble.” Then he looked at me.
“Come on, Opal,” he said. “Sit down. And I  will  tell you  ten things
about your mama.”

16
    One,”  said the preacher. We were sitting on  the couch and Winn-
Di[ie  was sitting  between us.  Winn-Di[ie  had  already decided that
he liked the couch a lot.  “One,”  said the preacher again. Winn-Di[ie
looked at him kind  of hard. “Your  mama was funny. She could make
just about anybody laugh.”
       “Two,”  he said. “She had red hair and freckles.”
       “Just like  me,” I said.
       “Just like  you,” the preacher nodded.
       “Three. She liked to plant things.  She had a talent for it. She
could stick a tire in  the ground and grow a car.”
       Winn-Di[ie  started chewing on his paw, and I  tapped him on
the head to make him stop.
       “Four,”  said the preacher. “She could run fast. If you were
racing her, you couldn’t ever let  her get a head start, because she
would beat you for sure.”
       “I’m  that way, too,”  I said. “Back home, in Watley, I  raced Liam
Fullerton, and beat him, and he said it  wasn’t fair, because boys and
girls shouldn’t race each other to begin with.  I told  him he was just
a sore loser.”
       The preacher nodded. He was Tuiet for a minute.
       “I’m  ready for number  ve,”   I told him.
       “Five,”  he said. “She couldn’t cook. She burned everything,
including water.  She had a hard time opening a can of beans. She
couldn’t make head nor tail  of a piece of meat. Si[.” The preacher
rubbed his nose and looked up at the ceiling. Winn-Di[ie  looked up,
too. “Number si[  is that your  mama loved a story. She would sit and
listen to stories all day long. She loved to be told a story. She
especially liked funny ones, stories that made her laugh.” The
preacher nodded his head like he was agreeing with himself.
       “What’s number seven?” I asked.

17
       “Let’s see,” he said. “She knew all the constellations, every
planet in the nighttime  sky. Every last one of them. She could name
them. And point them  out. And she never got tired of looking  up at
them.
       “Number eight,”  said the preacher, with his  eyes closed, “was
that she hated being a preacher’s wife. She said she just couldn’t
stand having the ladies at church judge what she was wearing and
what she was cooking and how she was singing. She said it made
her feel like a bug under a microscope.”
       Winn-Di[ie  lay down  on the couch. He put his nose in the
preacher’s lap and his tail in mine.
       “Ten,” said the preacher.
       “Nine,”  I told him.
       “Nine,”  said the preacher. “She drank. She drank beer. And
whiskey. And wine. Sometimes, she couldn’t stop drinking. And  that
made me and your mama  ght  Tuite a bit. Number ten,”  he said
with a long sigh, “number  ten, is that your  mama loved you. She
loved you very much.”
       “But she left me,”  I told him.
       “She left us,” said the preacher softly. I could  see him pulling
his old turtle  head back into his stupid turtle  shell. “She packed her
bags and left us, and she didn’t leave one thing behind.”
       “Okay,” I  said. I got up o   the couch. Winn-Di[ie   hopped o ,
too. “Thank you for  telling me,”  I said.
       I went right  back to my room and wrote  down all  ten things
that the preacher had told me. I wrote  them down just the way  he
said them to me so that I wouldn’t  forget them, and then I read
them out loud to Winn-Di[ie   until  I had them memori]ed.  I wanted
to know those ten things inside and out. That way,  if my mama ever
came back, I could recogni]e her, and I would  be able to grab her
and hold on to her tight  and not let her get away from  me again.

18
    Winn-Di[ie   couldn’t stand to  be left alone; we  found that out
real Tuick. If me and the preacher went o  and left him by himself
in the trailer,  he pulled all  the cushions o   the couch and all the
toilet paper o   the roll.  So we started tying him up outside with a
rope when we left. That didn’t work either. Winn-Di[ie howled until
Samuel, Mrs. Detweller’s dog, started howling, too. It was e[actly
the kind of noise that people in an all adult trailer park do not like
to hear.
      “He just doesn’t want to be left alone,” I told the preacher.
“That’s all. Let’s take him with us.” I could understand the way
Winn-Di[ie felt. Getting left behind probably made his heart feel
empty.
      After a while, the preacher gave in. And everywhere we went,
we took Winn-Di[ie. Even to church.
      The Open Arms Baptist Church of Naomi isn’t a regular-looking
church. The building used to be a Pick-It-4uick store, and when you
walk in the front door, the  rst thing you see is the Pick-It-4uick
motto. It’s written on the  oor in little tiny red tiles that make great
big letters that say “PICK PICK PICK 4UICK 4UICK 4UICK.” The
preacher tried painting over those tiles, but the letters won’t stay
covered up, and so the preacher has just given up and let them be.
      The other thing about the Open Arms that is di erent from
other churches is there aren’t any pews. People bring in their own
foldup chairs and lawn chairs, and so sometimes it looks more like
the congregation is watching a parade or sitting at a barbecue
instead of being at church. It’s kind of a strange church and I
thought Winn-Di[ie would  t right  in.
      But the  rst  time we brought Winn-Di[ie to the Open Arms, the
preacher tied him outside the front door.

19
       “Why did  we bring him  all the way here just to  tie him up?”  I
asked the preacher.
       “Because dogs don’t belong in church, Opal,” the preacher said.
“That’s why.”
       He tied Winn-Di[ie  up to  a tree and said how there was lots of
shade for him and that it  ought to work  out real good.
       Well, it  didn’t. The service started and there was some singing
and some sharing and some praying, and then the preacher started
preaching. And he wasn’t but two or  three words into his sermon
when there was a terrible howl  coming from outside.
       The preacher tried to ignore it.
       “Today,” he said.
       “Aaaaaarrooo,” said Winn-Di[ie.
       “Please,” said the preacher.
       “Arrrroooowwww,” said Winn-Di[ie  back.
       “Friends,” said the preacher.
       “Arrruiiiiipppp,”  wailed Winn-Di[ie.
       Everyone turned in their  lawn chairs and foldup chairs and
looked at one another.
       “Opal,”  said the preacher.
       “Owwwwww,” said Winn-Di[ie.
       “Yes sir?” I said.
       “Go get that dog!”  he yelled.
       “Yes sir!” I yelled  back.
       I went outside and untied  Winn-Di[ie  and brought him  inside,
and he sat down beside me and smiled up at the preacher, and the
preacher couldn’t help it;  he smiled back. Winn-Di[ie  had that e ect
on him.
       And so the preacher started in preaching again. Winn-Di[ie  sat
there listening to it,  wiggling  his ears this way and that, trying  to
catch all the words. And everything  would have been all right,
e[cept that a mouse ran across the  oor.
       The Open Arms had mice. They were there from when it was a
Pick-It-4uick  and there were lots of good things to eat in  the
building, and when the  Pick-It-4uick  became the Open Arms Baptist
Church of Naomi, the mice stayed around to eat all the leftover

20
crumbs from the potluck suppers. The preacher kept on saying he
was going to have to do something about them, but he never did.
Because the truth is, he couldn’t stand the thought of hurting
anything, even a mouse.
       Well, Winn-Di[ie  saw that  mouse, and he was up and after him.
One minute, everything was Tuiet and serious and the preacher was
going on and on and on; and the ne[t  minute, Winn-Di[ie  looked
like a furry  bullet, shooting across the building,  chasing that mouse.
He was barking and his feet were skidding all over the polished
Pick-It-4uick   oor,  and people were clapping and hollering  and
pointing. They really  went wild  when Winn-Di[ie  actually  caught
the mouse.
       “I have never in my  life seen a dog catch a mouse,” said Mrs.
Nordley. She was sitting ne[t to  me.
       “He’s a special dog,” I told her.
       “I imagine  so,” she said back.
       Winn-Di[ie  stood up there in front  of the whole  church,
wagging his tail and holding  the mouse real careful in his mouth,
holding onto him  tight but  not sTuishing him.
       “I believe that  mutt has got some retriever in him,”  said
somebody behind me. “That’s a hunting dog.”
       Winn-Di[ie  took the mouse over to the preacher and dropped it
at his feet. And when the mouse tried to get away, Winn-Di[ie   put
his paw right on the mouse’s tail. Then he smiled up at the
preacher. He showed him all his teeth. The preacher looked down at
the mouse. He looked at Winn-Di[ie.  He looked at me. He rubbed
his nose. It got real Tuiet in the Pick-It-4uick.
       “Let us pray,” the  preacher  nally  said, “for  this mouse.”
       And everybody started laughing and clapping. The preacher
picked up the mouse by the tail and walked and threw  it out  the
front door of  the Pick-It-4uick,  and everybody applauded again.
       Then he came back and we all prayed together. I prayed for my
mama. I told God how much she would have enjoyed hearing the
story of Winn-Di[ie  catching that  mouse. It would have made her
laugh. I asked God if maybe I could be the one to tell her that  story
someday.

21
       And then I talked to  God about how I was lonely in  Naomi
because I didn’t know that many kids, only  the ones from church.
And there weren’t that many  kids at the Open Arms, just Dunlap
and Stevie Dewberry, two brothers who weren’t twins  but looked
like they were. And Amanda Wilkinson,  whose face was always
pinched up like she was smelling something real bad; and Sweetie
Pie Thomas, who was only  ve years old and still  mostly a baby.
And none of them wanted to be my friend  anyway because they
probably thought I’d  tell on them  to the preacher for every little
thing they did  wrong; and then they would  get in trouble  with God
and their parents. So I told God that I was lonely,  even having
Winn-Di[ie.
       And  nally,   I prayed for the mouse, like the preacher suggested.
I prayed that he didn’t  get hurt when he went   ying  out the door  of
the Open Arms Baptist Church of Naomi. I prayed that he landed on
a nice soft patch of grass.

22
    I  spent a  lot  of  time  that  summer at  the  Herman W.  Block
Memorial Library. The Herman W. Block Memorial Library sounds
like it  would be a big fancy place, but it’s not.  It’s just a little  old
house full of books, and Miss Franny Block is in charge of them all.
She is a very small, very old woman with short gray hair, and she
was the  rst friend I made in Naomi.
      It all  started with Winn-Di[ie not liking it when I went into the
library, because he couldn’t go inside, too. But I showed him how he
could stand up on his hind legs and look in the window and see me
in there, selecting my books; and he was okay, as long as he could
see me. But the thing was, the  rst time Miss Franny Block saw
Winn-Di[ie standing up on his hind legs like that, looking in the
window, she didn’t think he was a dog. She thought he was a bear.
      This is what happened: I was picking out my books and kind of
humming to myself, and all of a sudden, there was this loud and
scary scream. I went running up to the front of the library, and there
was Miss Franny Block, sitting on the  oor behind her desk.
      “Miss Franny?” I said. “Are you all right?”
      “A bear,” she said.
      “A bear?” I asked.
      “He has come back,” she said.
      “He has?” I asked. “Where is he?”
      “Out there,” she said and raised a  nger and pointed at Winn-
Di[ie standing up on his hind legs, looking in the window for me.
      “Miss Franny Block,” I said, “that’s not a bear. That’s a dog.
That’s my dog. Winn-Di[ie.”
      “Are you positive?” she asked.
      “Yes ma’am,” I told her. “I’m positive. He’s my dog. I would
know him anywhere.”
      Miss Franny sat there trembling and shaking.

23
       “Come on,” I said. “Let  me help you up. It’s okay.” I  stuck out
my hand and Miss Franny took hold of it,  and I pulled her  up o   the
 oor.  She didn’t weigh hardly  anything at all.  Once she was
standing on her feet, she started acting all embarrassed, saying how
I must think  she was a silly old lady, mistaking a dog for a bear, but
that she had a bad e[perience with a bear coming into  the Herman
W. Block Memorial Library  a long time ago and she never had Tuite
gotten over it.
       “When did that  happen?” I asked her.
       “Well,”  said Miss Franny, “it is a very  long story.”
       “That’s okay,” I  told her. “I  am like my  mama in that I like  to
be told stories. But before you start telling  it, can Winn-Di[ie  come
in and listen, too? He gets lonely without  me.”
       “Well, I  don’t know,”  said Miss Franny. “Dogs are not allowed
in the Herman W. Block Memorial  Library.”
       “He’ll  be good,” I told  her. “He’s a dog who goes to church.”
And before she could say yes or no, I went outside and got Winn-
Di[ie,  and he came in and lay down with  a “huummmpp ”  and a
sigh, right at Miss Franny’s feet.
       She looked down at him and said, “He most certainly  is a large
dog.”
       “Yes ma’am,” I told  her. “He has a large heart, too.”
       “Well,”  Miss Franny said. She bent over and gave Winn-Di[ie a
pat on the head, and Winn-Di[ie  wagged his tail back and forth  and
snu ed  his nose on her little  old-lady  feet. “Let me get a chair and
sit down so I can tell this story  properly.”

24
    Back when Florida was wild,  when it  consisted of nothing but
palmetto trees and mosTuitoes so big they could  y away with you,”
Miss Franny Block started in, “and I was just a little girl no bigger
than you, my father, Herman W. Block, told me that  I could have
anything I wanted for my birthday. Anything at all.”
      Miss Franny looked around the library. She leaned in close to
me. “I don’t want to appear prideful,” she said, “but my daddy was
a very rich man. A very rich man.” She nodded and then leaned
back and said, “And I was a little girl who loved to read. So I told
him, I said, ‘Daddy, I would most certainly love to have a library for
my birthday, a small little library would be wonderful.’”
      “You asked for a whole library?”
      “A small one,” Miss Franny nodded. “I wanted a little house full
of nothing but books and I wanted to share them, too. And I got my
wish. My father built me this house, the very one we are sitting in
now. And at a very young age, I became a librarian. Yes ma’am.”
      “What about the bear?” I said.
      “Did I  mention that Florida was wild in those days?” Miss
Franny Block said.
      “Uh-huh, you did.”
      “It  was wild. There were wild men and wild women and wild
animals.”
      “Like bears!”
      “Yes ma’am. That’s right. Now, I have to tell you, I was a little-
miss-know-it-all. I was a miss-smarty-pants with my library full of
books. Oh, yes ma’am, I thought I knew the answers to everything.
Well, one hot Thursday, I was sitting in my library with all the
doors and windows open and my nose stuck in a book, when a
shadow crossed the desk. And without looking up, yes ma’am,

25
without  even looking up, I said, ‘Is there a book I can help you
 nd?’
       “Well, there  was no answer. And I thought it might  have been a
wild man or  a wild woman, scared of all these books and afraid to
speak up. But then I became aware of a very peculiar smell, a very
strong smell. I raised my eyes slowly. And standing right in  front of
me was a bear. Yes ma’am. A very large bear.”
       “How big?”  I asked.
       “Oh, well,”  said Miss Franny, “perhaps three times the si]e of
your dog.”
       “Then what happened?” I asked her.
       “Well,”  said Miss Franny, “I looked at him  and he looked at me.
He put his big nose up in the air and sni ed  and sni ed   as if he was
trying to  decide if a little-miss-know-it-all  librarian  was what he was
in the mood to eat. And I sat there. And then  I thought, ‘Well,  if this
bear intends to eat me, I am not going to let it  happen without  a
 ght.  No ma’am.’ So very slowly and very carefully,  I raised up the
book I was reading.”
       “What book was that?”  I asked.
       “Why, it  was War and Peace, a very large book. I raised it up
slowly and then I aimed it  carefully and I  threw it  right at  that bear
and screamed, ‘Be gone!’ And do you know what?”
       “No ma’am,” I  said.
       “He went. But this  is what I will  never forget.  He took the book
with him.”
       “Nuh-uh,”  I said.
       “Yes ma’am,” said Miss Franny. “He snatched it up and ran.”
       “Did he come back?” I asked.
       “No, I never saw him again. Well,  the men in town  used to
tease me about it. They used to say, ‘Miss Franny, we saw that bear
of yours out in the woods today. He was reading that book  and he
said it sure was good and would it be all right  if  he kept it for  just
another week.’ Yes ma’am. They did tease me about it.” She sighed.
“I imagine I’m  the only one left  from those days. I imagine I’m the
only one that even recalls that bear. All  my friends, everyone I knew
when I was young, they are all dead and gone.”

26
       She sighed again. She looked sad and old and wrinkled. It was
the same way I felt sometimes, being friendless in a new town and
not having a mama to comfort me. I  sighed, too.
       Winn-Di[ie  raised his head o   his paws and looked back and
forth between me and Miss Franny. He sat up then and showed Miss
Franny his teeth.
       “Well now,  look at that,”  she said. “That dog is smiling at me.”
       “It’s a talent  of his,” I told  her.
       “It  is a  ne  talent,” Miss Franny said. “A very   ne  talent.”  And
she smiled back at Winn-Di[ie.
       “We could be friends,”  I said to Miss Franny. “I mean you and
me and Winn-Di[ie,  we could all be friends.”
       Miss Franny smiled even bigger. “Why, that would  be grand,”
she said, “just grand.”
       And right  at that minute, right  when the three  of us had
decided to be friends, who should come marching into the Herman
W. Block Memorial Library  but old pinch-faced Amanda Wilkinson.
She walked right up to Miss Franny’s desk and said, “I  nished
Johnny Tremain and I enjoyed it very much. I would like  something
even more di cult   to  read now, because I am an advanced reader.”
       “Yes dear, I know,” said Miss Franny. She got up out of her
chair.
       Amanda pretended like I wasn’t there. She stared right past me.
“Are dogs allowed in the library?”  she asked Miss Franny as they
walked away.
       “Certain ones,” said Miss Franny, “a select few.” And then she
turned around and winked at  me. I smiled back. I had just made my
 rst  friend in  Naomi, and nobody was going to mess that up for me,
not even old pinch-faced Amanda Wilkinson.

27
    Winn-Di[ie’s    bald spots started growing  fur,  and the fur  that  he
had to begin  with  started looking  shiny  and healthy;  and he didn’t
limp  anymore. And you  could  tell  that he  was proud of  looking  so
good, proud  of not  looking  like  a stray.  I thought  what  he needed
most was a collar and a leash, so I went  into Gertrude’s Pets, where
there were  sh  and snakes and mice and li]ards  and gerbils and pet
supplies, and  I  found  a  real  handsome red  leather  collar   with  a
matching leash.
       Winn-Di[ie  was not allowed to  come inside the store (there was
a big sign on the door that said NO DOGS ALLOWED), so I held the collar
and the leash up to the window. And Winn-Di[ie,   who was standing
on the other side of the window,  pulled up his lip  and showed me
his teeth and snee]ed and wagged his tail something furious; so I
knew he absolutely loved that leash and collar combination.  But it
was very e[pensive.
       I decided to e[plain  my situation  to the man behind the
counter. I said, “I don’t  get a big enough allowance to a ord
something this fancy. But I love this collar  and leash, and so does
my dog, and I was thinking  that maybe you could set me up on an
installment plan.”
       “Installment  plan?” said the man.
       “Gertrude!”  somebody screamed in a real irritating voice.
       I looked around. It  was a parrot. She was sitting on top of one
of the  sh  tanks, looking right  at me.
       “An installment  plan,”  I said, ignoring the parrot,  “you know,
where I promise to give you my allowance  every week and you give
me the leash and the collar now.”
       “I don’t  think  I can do that,” said the man. He shook his head.
“No, the owner, she wouldn’t  like that.”  He looked down at the

28
counter. He wouldn’t look  at me. He had thick black hair,  and it was
slicked back like Elvis Presley’s. He had on a name tag that said OTIS.
       “Or I could  work for  you,” I said. “I  could come in and sweep
the  oors  and dust the shelves and take out the trash. I could do
that.”
       I looked around Gertrude’s Pets. There was sand and sun ower-
seed shells and big dust bunnies all over the  oor. I  could tell that  it
needed to be swept.
       “Uh,”  said Otis. He looked down at the counter some more.
       “Gertrude!”  the parrot screamed again.
       “I’m  real trustworthy,”  I said. “I’m  new in  town, but my  daddy
is a preacher. He’s the preacher at the Open Arms Baptist Church of
Naomi, so I’m real honest. But the only thing  is, Winn-Di[ie,  my
dog, he would have to come inside with  me; because if we get
separated for too long, he starts to howl something terrible.”
       “Gertrude doesn’t like dogs,” said Otis.
       “Is she the owner?” I asked.
       “Yes, I mean, no, I mean . . .” He  nally   looked up. He pointed
at the  sh  tank. “That Gertrude. The parrot.  I named her after the
owner.”
       “Gertrude’s a pretty bird!”  screamed Gertrude.
       “She might like  Winn-Di[ie,”  I  told Otis. “Almost  everybody
does. Maybe he could come inside and meet her, and if the two of
them get along, then could I have the job?”
       “Maybe,” Otis mumbled.  He looked down at the counter again.
       So I went and opened the door, and Winn-Di[ie  came trotting
on inside the store.
       “Dog!”  screamed Gertrude.
       “I know  it,”  Otis told her.
       And then Gertrude got real Tuiet. She sat on the top of the  sh
tank and cocked her head from one side to the other, looking at
Winn-Di[ie.  And Winn-Di[ie  stood and stared back at her. He didn’t
hardly move. He didn’t  wag his tail. He didn’t  smile. He didn’t
snee]e. He just stared at Gertrude and she stared at him. And then
she spread her wings out real far and  ew  and landed on top of
Winn-Di[ie’s  head.

29
       “Dog,” she croaked.
       Winn-Di[ie  wagged his tail just  a little  tiny bit.
       And Otis said, “You can start on Monday.”
       “Thank you,”  I told  him. “You won’t  be sorry.”
       On the way out of Gertrude’s Pets, I said to Winn-Di[ie,  “You
are better at making friends than anybody I  have ever known. I bet
if my mama knew you, she would think  you were the best dog
ever.”
       Winn-Di[ie  was smiling up at  me and I was smiling down at
him, and so neither one of us was looking where we were going and
we almost bumped right into  Sweetie Pie Thomas. She was standing
there, sucking on the knuckle of her third   nger,  staring in  the
window of Gertrude’s Pets.
       She took her  nger  out of her mouth  and looked at me. Her
eyes were all big and round. “Was that bird  sitting on that  dog’s
head?” she asked. She had her hair tied up in a ponytail with a pink
ribbon. But it  wasn’t much of a ponytail,  it was mostly ribbon  and a
few strands of hair.
       “Yes,” I told  her.
       “I seen it,”  she said. She nodded her head and put her knuckle
back in her mouth. Then she took it out  again real Tuick. “I  seen
that dog in church, too.  He was catching a mouse. I want a dog just
like it,  but my mama won’t let  me get no dog. She says if I’m real
good, I might get to buy  me a gold sh or  one of them gerbils. That’s
what she says. Can I pet your dog?”
       “Sure,” I told  her.
       Sweetie Pie stroked Winn-Di[ie’s head so long and serious that
his eyes drooped half closed and drool came out of the side of his
mouth. “I’m  going to be si[  years old in September. I got to stop
sucking on my knuckle once I’m si[,”  said Sweetie Pie. “I’m having a
party. Do you want to  come to my party? The theme is pink.”
       “Sure,” I told  her.
       “Can this dog come?” she asked.
       “You bet,” I  told her.
       And all of a sudden, I felt  happy. I had a dog. I had a job. I had
Miss Franny Block for a friend. And I had my   rst  invitation  to  a

30
party in Naomi. It didn’t matter that it came from a  ve-year-old
and the party wasn’t until September. I didn’t feel so lonely
anymore.

31
    Just   about   everything    that   happened  to   me   that   summer
happened because of Winn-Di[ie. For instance, without him,  I would
never have met Gloria Dump. He was the one who introduced us.
       What happened was this: I was riding my bike  home from
Gertrude’s Pets and Winn-Di[ie was running along beside me. We
went past Dunlap and Stevie Dewberry’s house, and when Dunlap
and Stevie saw me, they got on their bikes and started following me.
They wouldn’t ride  with  me; they just rode behind me and
whispered things that I couldn’t  hear. Neither one of them had any
hair on his head, because their mama shaved their heads every week
during the summer because of the one time Dunlap got  eas in his
hair from their  cat, Sadie. And now they looked like  two identical
bald-headed babies, even though they weren’t twins. Dunlap was
ten years old, like me, and Stevie was nine and tall for his age.
       “I can hear you,”  I hollered back at them. “I  can hear what
you’re saying.” But I couldn’t.
       Winn-Di[ie  started to race way ahead of me.
       “You better watch  out,” Dunlap hollered.  “That dog is headed
right for  the witch’s house.”
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   I called. But he kept on going  faster and hopped
a gate and went into the most overgrown jungle  of a yard that I had
ever seen.
       “You better go get your dog out  of there,” Dunlap said.
       “The witch  will  eat that dog,” Stevie said.
       “Shut up,”  I told them.
       I got o   my  bike and went up to the gate and hollered,  “Winn-
Di[ie,  you better come on out of there.”
       But he didn’t.
       “She’s probably eating him right  now,”  Stevie said. He and
Dunlap were standing behind me. “She eats dogs all the time.”

32
       “Get lost, you bald-headed babies,” I said.
       “Hey,”  said Dunlap, “that ain’t  a very nice way for  a preacher’s
daughter to talk.”  He and Stevie backed up a little.
       I stood there and thought for  a minute. I  nally   decided that I
was more afraid of losing Winn-Di[ie  than  I was of having to deal
with a dog-eating witch,  so I went through the  gate and into the
yard.
       “That witch  is going to eat the dog for  dinner and you for
dessert,” Stevie said.
       “We’ll  tell the preacher what happened to you,”  Dunlap shouted
after me.
       By then, I was deep in the jungle. There was every kind of thing
growing everywhere. There were  owers  and vegetables and trees
and vines.
       “Winn-Di[ie?”   I said.
       “Heh-heh-heh.” I heard: “This  dog sure likes to eat.”
       I went around a really  big tree all covered in moss, and there
was Winn-Di[ie.  He was eating something right out of the  witch’s
hand. She looked up at me. “This dog sure likes peanut butter,” she
said. “You can always trust a dog that likes peanut butter.”
       She was old with crinkly  brown skin. She had on a big  oppy
hat with   owers  all over it,  and she didn’t have any teeth, but she
didn’t look  like a witch.  She looked nice. And Winn-Di[ie  liked her,
I could tell.
       “I’m  sorry he got in your garden,”  I said.
       “You ain’t  got to be sorry,” she said. “I enjoy a little  company.”
       “My name’s Opal,” I  told her.
       “My name’s Gloria Dump,”  she said. “Ain’t that  a terrible last
name? Dump?”
       “My last name is Buloni,”  I said. “Sometimes the kids at school
back home in Watley called me ‘Lunch Meat.’”
       “Hah!”  Gloria Dump laughed. “What  about this dog? What you
call him?”
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   I said.
       Winn-Di[ie  thumped his tail  on the ground. He tried  smiling,
but it was hard with  his mouth  all full  of peanut butter.

33
       “Winn-Di[ie?”   Gloria Dump said. “You mean like the  grocery
store?”
       “Yes ma’am,” I said.
       “Whooooeee,” she said. “That takes the strange-name pri]e,
don’t it?”
       “Yes ma’am,” I said.
       “I was just  [ing    to make myself a peanut-butter sandwich,”
she said. “You want one, too?”
       “All  right,”  I said. “Yes, please.”
       “Go on and sit down,”  she said, pointing at a lawn chair  with
the back all busted out of it.  “But sit down  careful.”
       I sat down careful and Gloria Dump made me a peanut butter
sandwich on white bread.
       Then she made one for herself and put her false teeth in, to eat
it; when she was done, she said to me, “You know, my eyes ain’t too
good at all. I can’t see nothing but the general shape of things, so I
got to rely on my heart.  Why don’t you go on and tell  me everything
about yourself, so as I can see you with my heart.”
       And because Winn-Di[ie was looking up  at her like she was the
best thing he had ever seen, and because the peanut-butter
sandwich had been so good, and because I had been waiting for a
long time to tell  some person everything about me, I did.

34
    I  told  Gloria  Dump  everything. I  told   her how  me  and  the
preacher had just moved to Naomi and how I had to leave all my
friends behind. I told her about my mama leaving, and I listed out
the ten things that I knew about her; and I e[plained  that here, in
Naomi, I missed Mama more than I ever had in Watley. I told her
about the preacher being like a turtle, hiding all the time inside his
shell. I told her about  nding Winn-Di[ie in the produce department
and how, because of him, I became friends with Miss Franny Block
and got a job working for a man named Otis at Gertrude’s Pets and
got invited  to  Sweetie Pie Thomas’s birthday party.  I  even told
Gloria Dump how Dunlap and Stevie Dewberry called her a witch.
But I told her they were stupid, mean, bald-headed boys and I didn’t
believe them, not for long anyhow.
      And the whole time I was talking, Gloria Dump was listening.
She was nodding her head and smiling and frowning and saying,
“Hmmm,” and “Is that right?”
      I could feel her listening with all her heart, and it felt good.
      “You know what?” she said when I was all done.
      “What?”
      “Could be that you got more of your mama in you than just red
hair and freckles and running fast.”
      “Really?” I said. “Like what?”
      “Like maybe you got her green thumb. The two of us could
plant something and see how it grows; test your thumb out.”
      “Okay,” I said.
      What Gloria Dump picked for me to grow was a tree. Or she
said it was a tree. To me, it looked more like a plant. She had me
dig a hole for it and put it in the ground and pat the dirt around it
tight, like it was a baby and I was tucking it into bed.
      “What kind of tree is it?” I asked Gloria Dump.

35
       “It’s a wait-and-see tree,” she said.
       “What’s that mean?”
       “It  means you got to wait for it  to grow  up before you know
what it is.”
       “Can I come back and see it tomorrow?” I asked.
       “Child,”  she said, “as long as this is my garden, you’re welcome
in it. But  that tree ain’t going  to have changed much by tomorrow.”
       “But I want  to see you, too,” I said.
       “Hmmmph,”  said Gloria Dump. “I  ain’t going nowhere. I  be
right here.”
       I woke Winn-Di[ie  up  then. He had peanut butter in his
whiskers, and he kept yawning and stretching. He licked Gloria
Dump’s hand before we left, and I thanked her.
       That night when the  preacher was tucking me into bed, I told
him how I got  a job at Gertrude’s Pets, and I told him all about
making friends with  Miss Franny Block and getting invited  to
Sweetie Pie’s party, and I told him about meeting Gloria  Dump.
Winn-Di[ie  lay on the  oor,   waiting  for the preacher to leave so he
could hop up on the bed like he always did.  When I was done
talking, the preacher kissed me good night, and then he leaned way
over and gave Winn-Di[ie  a kiss, too, right on top of his  head.
       “You can go ahead and get up there now,” he said to Winn-
Di[ie.
       Winn-Di[ie  looked at the preacher. He didn’t  smile at him, but
he opened his mouth wide like he was laughing, like  the preacher
had just told him  the funniest joke in the  world; and this  is what
ama]ed me the most: The preacher laughed back. Winn-Di[ie
hopped up on the bed, and the preacher got up and turned out the
light. I  leaned over and kissed Winn-Di[ie, too, right  on the nose,
but he didn’t notice.  He was already asleep and snoring.

36
    That  night,  there  was a  real bad  thunderstorm.  But what  woke
me up wasn’t the thunder and lightning.   It was Winn-Di[ie,  whining
and butting his head against my bedroom door.
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   I said. “What  are you doing?”
       He didn’t pay any attention  to me. He just kept beating his head
against the door and whining and whimpering;  and when I got  out
of bed and went over and put my hand on his head, he was shaking
and trembling so hard that it  scared me. I knelt down and wrapped
my arms around him, but he didn’t  turn  and look at me or smile or
snee]e or wag his tail, or do any normal  kind of Winn-Di[ie   thing;
he just kept beating his head against the door and crying and
shaking.
       “You want the door  open?” I said. “Huh? Is that what  you
want?” I stood up and opened the door and Winn-Di[ie   ew
through it  like something big and ugly  and mean was chasing him.
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   I hissed, “come back here.” I didn’t  want him
going and waking the preacher up.
       But it was too late. Winn-Di[ie   was already at the other end of
the trailer, in  the preacher’s room. I could tell  because there was a
sproi-i-ing sound that must have come from Winn-Di[ie jumping  up
on the bed, and then there was a sound from the preacher like he
was real surprised. But none of it lasted long, because Winn-Di[ie
came tearing back out of the preacher’s room, panting and running
like cra]y.  I tried  to grab him, but he was going too fast.
       “Opal?” said the preacher. He was standing at the door to his
bedroom, and his hair was all kind  of wild  on top of his head, and
he was looking around like he wasn’t sure where he was. “Opal,
what’s going on?”

37
      “I  don’t know,” I told him. But just then there was a huge crack
of thunder, one so loud that it shook the whole trailer, and Winn-
Di[ie came shooting back out of my room and went running right
past me and I screamed, “Daddy, watch out!”
      But the preacher was still confused. He just stood there, and
Winn-Di[ie came barreling right toward him like he was a bowling
ball and the preacher was the only pin left standing, and wham, they
both fell to the ground.
      “Uh-oh,” I said.
      “Opal?” said the preacher. He was lying on his stomach, and
Winn-Di[ie was sitting on top of him, panting and whining.
      “Yes sir,” I said.
      “Opal,” the preacher said again.
      “Yes sir,” I said louder.
      “Do you know what a pathological fear is?”
      “No sir,” I told  him.
      The preacher raised a hand. He rubbed his nose. “Well,” he
said, after a minute, “it’s a fear that goes way beyond normal fears.
It’s a fear you can’t be talked out of or reasoned out of.”
      Just then there was another crack of thunder and Winn-Di[ie
rose straight up in the air like somebody had poked him with
something hot. When he hit the  oor, he started running. He ran
back to my bedroom, and I didn’t even try to catch him; I just got
out of his way.
      The preacher lay there on the ground, rubbing his nose. Finally,
he sat up. He said, “Opal, I believe Winn-Di[ie has a pathological
fear of thunderstorms.” And just when he  nished his sentence, here
came Winn-Di[ie again, running to save his life. I got the preacher
up o  the  oor  and out of the way just in time.
      There didn’t seem to be a thing we could do for Winn-Di[ie to
make him feel better, so we just sat there and watched him run back
and forth, all terrori]ed and panting. And every time there was
another crack of thunder, Winn-Di[ie acted all over again like it was
surely the end of the world.
      “The storm won’t last long,” the preacher told me. “And when
it’s over, the real Winn-Di[ie will come back.”

38
       After a while,  the storm did end. The rain stopped. And there
wasn’t any more lightning,  and  nally,  the last rumble  of thunder
went away and Winn-Di[ie  Tuit  running back and forth  and came
over to where me and the preacher were sitting and cocked his
head, like he was saying, “What in the world  are you two doing  out
of bed in the middle of  the night?”
       And then he crept up on the couch with  us in this funny  way he
has, where he gets on the couch an inch at a time, kind of sliding
himself onto it,  looking o   in  a di erent  direction,  like  it’s all
happening by accident, like he doesn’t intend to get on the couch,
but all of a sudden, there he is.
       And so the three of us sat there. I rubbed Winn-Di[ie’s  head and
scratched him behind the ears the way he liked. And the preacher
said, “There are an awful lot of  thunderstorms in Florida in  the
summertime.”
       “Yes sir,” I said. I was afraid that  maybe he would say we
couldn’t keep a dog who went cra]y  with  pathological fear every
time there was a crack of thunder.
       “We’ll  have to keep an eye on him,” the preacher said. He put
his arm around Winn-Di[ie.  “We’ll  have to make sure he doesn’t get
out during a storm. He might  run away. We have to make sure we
keep him safe.”
       “Yes sir,” I said again. All  of a sudden it was hard for me to
talk. I loved the preacher so much. I loved him  because he loved
Winn-Di[ie.  I loved him  because he was going to forgive Winn-Di[ie
for being afraid. But most of all,  I loved him  for putting  his arm
around Winn-Di[ie  like  that, like he was already trying  to keep him
safe.

39
    Me   and Winn-Di[ie   got  to Gertrude’s Pets so early  for  my   rst
day of work  that  the CLOSED sign was still in the window. But when I
pushed on the door, it  swung open, and so we went on inside. I  was
about to call out  to Otis that  we were there, but  then I heard music.
It  was the  prettiest  music  I  have ever  heard  in  my  life.  I  looked
around to see where it  was coming from,  and that’s  when I noticed
that all  the animals were out  of their  cages. There were rabbits and
hamsters and gerbils and mice and birds and li]ards and snakes, and
they were all  just  sitting  there on the   oor   like they  had turned  to
stone, and Otis was standing in the  middle of  them. He was playing
a guitar and he had on skinny pointy-toed  cowboy boots and he was
tapping them while  he was playing  the music.  His eyes were closed
and he was smiling.
       Winn-Di[ie  got a dreamy kind  of look on his face. He smiled
really hard at Otis and then he snee]ed and then his whiskers went
all fu]]y,   and then he sighed and kind of dropped to the  oor   with
all the other animals. Just then, Gertrude caught sight of  Winn-
Di[ie.  “Dog,” she croaked, and  ew  over and landed on his head.
Otis looked up at me. He stopped playing his guitar and the spell
was broken. The rabbits started hopping and the birds started  ying
and the li]ards started leaping  and the snakes started slithering and
Winn-Di[ie  started barking and chasing everything that  was moving,
and Otis shouted, “Help me!”
       For what seemed like a long time, me and Otis ran around
trying to  catch mice and gerbils and hamsters and snakes and
li]ards. We kept on bumping  into each other and tripping  over the
animals, and Gertrude kept screaming, “Dog! Dog!”
       Every time I caught something, I put  it back in  the  rst  cage I
saw; I didn’t care if it  was the right  cage or not. I just put it  in and

40
slammed the door. And the whole time I  was chasing things, I was
thinking that  Otis must be some kind of snake charmer, the way he
could play his guitar  and make all the animals turn to  stone. And
then I thought, “This  is silly.”  I shouted over Winn-Di[ie  barking
and Gertrude yelling. I said, “Play  some more music, Otis.”
       He looked at me for a minute. Then he started playing  his
guitar, and in just  a few seconds, everything was Tuiet. Winn-Di[ie
was lying on the  oor,  blinking  his eyes and smiling to himself  and
snee]ing every now and then, and the mice and the gerbils and the
rabbits and the li]ards  and the snakes that we hadn’t caught yet got
Tuiet and sat still, and I picked them  up one by one and put them
back in their cages.
       When I was all done, Otis stopped playing. He looked down at
his boots. “I was just playing them  some music. It makes them
happy.”
       “Yes sir,” I said. “Did  they escape from their cages?”
       “No,”  Otis said. “I take them out. I  feel sorry for them being
locked up all the time.  I know what  it’s like, being locked up.”
       “You do?” I said.
       “I have been in jail,”  Otis said. He looked up at me real Tuick
and then looked back down at his boots.
       “You have?” I said.
       “Never mind,”  said Otis. “Aren’t  you here to sweep the  oor?”
       “Yes sir,” I told  him.
       He walked over to the counter and started digging  through a
pile of things, and  nally,   he came up with a broom.
       “Here,” he said. “You should start  sweeping.” Only he must
have gotten confused. He was holding out his guitar to me, instead
of the broom.
       “With  your guitar?”  I asked.
       He blushed and handed me the broom and I started to work. I
am a good sweeper. I swept the whole store and then dusted some
of the shelves. The whole time I worked, Winn-Di[ie   followed me,
and Gertrude followed him,   ying  behind him  and sitting on his
head and his back and croaking real Tuiet to herself, “Dog, dog.”

41
       When I was done, Otis thanked me. I left Gertrude’s Pets
thinking about  how the preacher probably wouldn’t  like  it very
much that I was working  for a criminal.
       Sweetie Pie Thomas was waiting for me right out front.  “I  seen
that,” she said. She stood there and sucked on her knuckle and
stared at me.
       “Seen what?” I said.
       “I seen all them animals out of  their cages and keeping real
still. Is that man magic?”  she asked.
       “Kind of,”  I told  her.
       She hugged Winn-Di[ie around the neck. “Just  like this grocery-
store dog, right?”
       “Right,”  I said.
       I started walking,  and Sweetie Pie took her knuckle out of her
mouth and put her hand in  mine.
       “Are you coming to  my birthday  party?” she asked.
       “I surely am,”  I told  her.
       “The theme is pink,”  she said.
       “I know  it,”  I told  her.
       “I gotta  go,” she said all of a sudden. “I gotta go home and tell
my mama about what I seen. I live right  down there. In  that yellow
house. That’s my mama on the porch. You see her? She’s waving at
you.”
       I waved at the woman on the porch  and she waved back, and I
watched Sweetie Pie run o   to tell her mama about Otis being a
magic man. It made me think about my  mama and how I wanted to
tell her the story about  Otis charming all the animals. I  was
collecting stories for her. I would  also tell her about Miss Franny
and the bear, and about meeting Gloria Dump and believing for  just
a minute that she was a witch. I had a feeling that  these were the
kind of stories my mama would  like, the kind  that would  make her
laugh out loud, the way  the preacher said she liked to laugh.

42
    Me   and  Winn-Di[ie   got  into  a  daily  routine   where we  would
leave the  trailer  early  in  the morning  and  get down  to  Gertrude’s
Pets in  time  to  hear  Otis  play  his  guitar   music for   the  animals.
Sometimes, Sweetie Pie snuck in for the concert, too. She sat on the
 oor   and  wrapped  her  arms around  Winn-Di[ie    and rocked  him
back and forth like  he was a big old  teddy bear. And then  when the
music was over, she would walk around trying  to pick  out which pet
she wanted; but  she always  gave up  and went  home, because the
only thing  she really  wanted  was a dog  like  Winn-Di[ie.   After  she
was gone, I  would  sweep and clean  up and  even arrange some of
Otis’s shelves, because he did not have an  eye for arranging  things
and I did. And  when I was done, Otis would  write  down my  time in
a notebook  that  he had  marked  on  the outside,  “One  red leather
collar, one red leather leash.” And  the whole time,  he did not in  any
way ever act like a criminal.
       After working  at Gertrude’s Pets, me and Winn-Di[ie would  go
over to the Herman W. Block Memorial  Library and talk  to Miss
Franny Block and listen to her tell  us a story. But my favorite place
to be that summer was in Gloria Dump’s yard. And I   gured  it was
Winn-Di[ie’s  favorite place to be, too, because when we got up to
the last block before her house, Winn-Di[ie  would break away from
my bike and start to run  for all he was worth,  heading for Gloria
Dump’s backyard and his spoonful of peanut butter.
       Sometimes, Dunlap and Stevie Dewberry would follow me.
They would holler,  “There goes the preacher’s daughter, visiting the
witch.”
       “She’s not a witch,” I  told them. It  made me mad the way they
wouldn’t listen  to me and kept on believing whatever  they wanted
to believe about Gloria Dump.

43
       One time Stevie said to me, “My mama says you shouldn’t be
spending all your time cooped up in that  pet shop and at that
library, sitting  around talking  with  old ladies. She says you should
get out in the fresh air and play  with kids  your own age. That’s what
my mama says.”
       “Oh, lay o    her,” Dunlap said to Stevie. Then he turned to me.
“He don’t mean it,”  he said.
       But I was already mad. I shouted at Stevie. I said, “I don’t  care
what your mama says. She’s not my mama, so she can’t tell me what
to do.”
       “I’m  going to tell my  mama you said that,” shouted Stevie, “and
she’ll tell your  daddy and he’ll shame you in front  of the whole
church. And that pet shop man is retarded and he was in jail  and I
wonder if your  daddy knows that.”
       “Otis is not retarded,”  I said. “And  my daddy knows that he was
in jail.”  That was a lie. But I didn’t  care. “And you  can go ahead and
tell on me if you  want, you big bald-headed baby.”
       I swear, it about wore me out  yelling at Dunlap  and Stevie
Dewberry every day; by the time I  got to Gloria Dump’s yard, I felt
like a soldier who had been  ghting   a hard battle. Gloria would
make me a peanut-butter sandwich straight o   and then she would
pour me a cup of co ee with  half  co ee and half  milk and that
would refresh me.
       “Why don’t  you play with  them boys?” Gloria asked me.
       “Because they’re ignorant,” I told  her. “They still  think  you’re a
witch. It  doesn’t matter how many times I tell  them you’re not.”
       “I think  they are just trying  to make friends with  you in  a
roundabout way,” Gloria  said.
       “I don’t  want to be their  friend,”  I said.
       “It  might be fun having  them two boys for friends.”
       “I’d rather  talk with  you,”  I said. “They’re stupid.  And mean.
And they’re boys.”
       Gloria would  shake her head and sigh, and then she would ask
me what was going on in the world  and did I have any stories to tell
her. And I always did.

44
    Sometimes,  I told   Gloria  the story  Miss  Franny  Block had  just
told  me.  Or   I  imitated   Otis   tapping  his   pointy-toed   boots  and
playing  for all  the  animals,  and that  always  made her laugh.  And
sometimes, I made up a story and Gloria Dump would  listen to  it all
the way  through  from  beginning  to  end. She told  me  she used to
love to read stories, but she couldn’t anymore because her eyes were
so bad.
       “Can’t you get some really strong glasses?” I asked her.
       “Child,”  she said, “they don’t make glasses strong enough for
these eyes.”
       One day, when the storytelling  was done, I decided to tell
Gloria that Otis was a criminal.  I thought maybe I should  tell an
adult about it,  and Gloria was the best adult I knew.
       “Gloria?”  I said.
       “Mmmm-hmmm,”  she said back.
       “You know Otis?”
       “I don’t  know him.  But I know what  you tell me ’bout  him.”
       “Well, he’s a criminal.  He’s been in jail. Do you think  I should
be afraid of him?”
       “What for?”
       “I don’t  know. For doing bad things, I  guess. For being in jail.”
       “Child,”  said Gloria, “let  me show you something.” She got up
out of her chair real slow  and took hold of my  arm. “Let’s the two of
us walk all the way to  the back of this yard.”
       “Okay,” I  said.
       We walked and Winn-Di[ie  followed  right behind  us. It was a
huge yard and I had never been all the way back in it.  When we got
to a big old tree, we stopped.
       “Look at this tree,”  Gloria said.

45
       I looked up. There were bottles hanging from  just about every
branch. There were whiskey bottles and beer bottles and wine
bottles all tied on with  string,  and some of them were clanking
against each other and making a spooky kind of noise. Me and
Winn-Di[ie  stood and stared at the tree, and the hair on top of  his
head rose up a little bit and he growled  deep in his throat.
       Gloria Dump pointed her cane at the tree.
       “What you think  about this  tree?”
       I said, “I don’t  know. Why are all  those bottles on it?”
       “To keep the ghosts away,” Gloria said.
       “What ghosts?”
       “The ghosts of all the things I done wrong.”
       I looked at all  the bottles on the tree. “You did  that many things
wrong?” I asked her.
       “Mmmm-hmmm,”  said Gloria. “More  than that.”
       “But you’re the  nicest person I know,” I told  her.
       “Don’t mean I haven’t  done bad things,” she said.
       “There’s whiskey bottles on there,”  I told her. “And  beer
bottles.”
       “Child,”  said Gloria Dump, “I  know that.  I’m the one who put
’em there. I’m the one who drank what  was in ’em.”
       “My mama drank,”  I whispered.
       “I know  it,”  Gloria Dump said.
       “The preacher says that sometimes she couldn’t stop drinking.”
       “Mmmm-hmmm,”  said Gloria again. “That’s the  way it is for
some folks. We get started and we can’t get stopped.”
       “Are you one of those people?”
       “Yes ma’am. I am. But these days, I don’t drink nothing  stronger
than co ee.”
       “Did the whiskey  and beer and wine, did they make you do the
bad things that are ghosts now?”
       “Some of them,” said Gloria Dump. “Some of them I  would’ve
done anyway, with alcohol  or without  it. Before I learned.”
       “Learned what?”
       “Learned what is the most important  thing.”
       “What’s that?”  I asked her.

46
       “It’s di erent   for everyone,”  she said. “You  nd  out on your
own. But in the meantime, you  got to remember, you can’t always
judge people by the things they done. You got to judge them by
what they are doing now. You judge Otis by  the pretty music he
plays and how kind he is to them animals, because that’s all you
know about him right  now. All  right?”
       “Yes ma’am,” I said.
       “And them Dewberry  boys, you try not to  judge them too harsh
either, all right?”
       “All  right,”  I said.
       “All  right then,”  said Gloria Dump, and she turned and started
walking away. Winn-Di[ie   nudged me with his wet nose and
wagged his tail; when he saw I wasn’t going, he trotted  after Gloria.
I stayed where I was and studied the tree. I wondered if my mama,
wherever she was, had a tree full of bottles; and I wondered if  I was
a ghost to her, the same way she sometimes seemed like a ghost to
me.

47
    The  Herman  W. Block  Memorial  Library’s  air-conditioning   unit
didn’t  work  very  good, and  there was only  one  fan; and  from  the
minute me  and Winn-Di[ie   got in  the  library,  he hogged  it  all. He
lay right  in front  of  it and wagged his  tail and  let it  blow his  fur all
around. Some of his fur  was pretty  loose and blew  right  o    of him
like  a dandelion  pu .   I  worried  about him  hogging  the  fan, and  I
worried about the fan  blowing him  bald; but Miss Franny said not to
worry  about either  thing,  that  Winn-Di[ie   could  hog the  fan  if  he
wanted and she had never in her life seen a dog made bald by a fan.
       Sometimes, when Miss Franny was telling a story, she would
have a  t.  They were small  ts  and they didn’t  last long. But what
happened was she would forget what she was saying. She would just
stop and start to shake like a little  leaf. And when that happened,
Winn-Di[ie  would get up from  the fan and sit right  at Miss Franny
Block’s side. He would sit up tall, protecting  her, with  his ears
standing up straight on his head, like soldiers. And when Miss
Franny stopped shaking and started talking again, Winn-Di[ie  would
lick her hand and lie back down  in front  of the fan.
       Whenever Miss Franny had one of her  ts, it  reminded me of
Winn-Di[ie  in a thunderstorm.  There were a lot of thunderstorms
that summer. And I got real good at holding  on to Winn-Di[ie
whenever they came. I held on to him and comforted  him and
whispered to him and rocked him,  just the same way he tried to
comfort Miss Franny when she had her  ts.  Only I held on to  Winn-
Di[ie  for another reason, too. I held on to him  tight  so he wouldn’t
run away.
       It all  made me think about Gloria Dump. I  wondered who
comforted her when she heard those bottles knocking together,
those ghosts chattering about the things she had done wrong. I

48
wanted to comfort Gloria  Dump. And I decided that the best way to
do that would be to read her a book, read it  to her loud enough to
keep the ghosts away.
       And so I asked Miss Franny. I said, “Miss Franny, I’ve got a
grown-up friend whose eyes are going on her, and I would like  to
read her a book out loud. Do you have any suggestions?”
       “Suggestions?” Miss Franny said. “Yes ma’am, I have
suggestions. Of course, I have suggestions. How about Gone with the
Wind?”
       “What’s that about?”  I asked her.
       “Why,”  said Miss Franny, “it’s a wonderful  story about the Civil
War.”
       “The Civil  War?” I said.
       “Do not tell  me you have never heard of the Civil War?”  Miss
Franny Block looked like she was going to faint. She waved her
hands in front of her face.
       “I know  about the Civil  War,” I told  her. “That was the war
between the South and the North over slavery.”
       “Slavery, yes,” said Miss Franny. “It was also about states’
rights and money. It was a terrible  war. My great-grandfather fought
in that war.  He was just a boy.”
       “Your great-grandfather?”
       “Yes ma’am, Littmus W. Block. Now there’s a story.”
       Winn-Di[ie  yawned real big and lay  down on his side, with  a
thump and a sigh. I swear he knew that phrase: “Now there’s a
story.” And he knew it  meant we weren’t going anywhere real soon.
       “Go ahead and tell it to  me, Miss Franny,” I said. And I sat
down cross-legged ne[t to Winn-Di[ie.  I pushed him and tried  to get
him to share the fan. But he pretended he was asleep. And he
wouldn’t move.
       I was all settled in and ready for  a good story when the door
banged and pinch-faced Amanda Wilkinson came in. Winn-Di[ie  sat
up and stared at her. He tried out a smile on her, but  she didn’t
smile back and so he lay down again.
       “I’m  ready for another book,”  Amanda said, slamming her book
down on Miss Franny’s desk.

49
       “Well,”  said Miss Franny, “maybe you wouldn’t  mind waiting.  I
am telling India  Opal a story about my great-grandfather. You are,
of course, more than welcome to listen. It will  be just one minute.”
       Amanda sighed a real big dramatic sigh and stared past me. She
pretended like she wasn’t interested, but she was, I could tell.
       “Come sit over here,” said Miss Franny.
       “I’ll  stand, thank you,”  said Amanda.
       “Suit yourself,”  Miss Franny shrugged. “Now where was I? Oh,
yes. Littmus. Littmus W. Block.”

50
    Littmus  W.  Block was just a boy  when the   ring   on Fort Sumter
occurred,” Miss Franny Block said as she started in on her story.
       “Fort Sumter?” I  said.
       “It  was the  ring  on Fort Sumter that  started the war,” said
Amanda.
       “Okay,” I  said. I shrugged.
       “Well, Littmus  was fourteen years old. He was strong and big,
but he was still just a boy. His daddy, Artley  W. Block, had already
enlisted, and Littmus told his mama that  he could not stand by and
let the South get beat, and so he went to  ght,  too.”  Miss Franny
looked around the library  and then she whispered, “Men and boys
always want to  ght.  They are always looking  for a reason to go to
war. It is the saddest thing. They have this abiding notion  that war
is fun. And no history lesson will  convince them di erently.
       “Anyway, Littmus  went and enlisted. He lied about  his age. Yes
ma’am. Like I said, he was a big boy. And the army took him,  and
Littmus went o    to war, just like  that. Left behind his  mother and
three sisters. He went o   to be a hero. But he soon found out the
truth.”  Miss Franny closed her eyes and shook her head.
       “What truth?”  I asked her.
       “Why, that  war is hell,”  Miss Franny said with her eyes still

       “ closed. “Pure hell.”
        Hell is a cuss word,” said Amanda. I stole a look at her. Her
face was pinched up even more than usual.
       “War,”  said Miss Franny with her eyes still closed, “should be a
cuss word, too.” She shook her head and opened her eyes. She
pointed at me and then she pointed at Amanda. “You, neither of
you, can imagine.”
       “No ma’am!”  Amanda and me said at e[actly the same time. We
looked real Tuick at each other and then back at Miss Franny.

51
       “You cannot imagine. Littmus  was hungry all the time.  And he
was covered with all manner of vermin;   eas and lice.  And in the
winter, he was so cold he thought for sure he would  free]e to death.
And in the summer, why there’s nothing  worse than war in the
summertime. It stinks so. And the only thing  that made Littmus
forget that he was hungry and itchy  and hot or cold was that he was
getting shot at. And he got shot at Tuite a bit.  And he was nothing
more than a child.”
       “Did he get killed?”  I asked Miss Franny.
       “Good grief,”  said Amanda. She rolled her eyes.
       “Now, Opal,”  Miss Franny said, “I wouldn’t  be standing in this
room telling  this story if he was killed.  I wouldn’t  e[ist.  No ma’am.
He had to live. But he was a changed man. Yes ma’am. A changed
man. He walked back home when the war was over. He walked
from Virginia  all the way  back to Georgia. He didn’t have a horse.
Nobody had a horse e[cept for the Yankees. He walked. And when
he got home, there was no home there.”
       “Where was it?” I  asked her. I didn’t care if Amanda thought  I
was stupid. I wanted to know.
       “Why,”  Miss Franny shouted so loud that Winn-Di[ie  and
Amanda Wilkinson and me all jumped, “the  Yankees burned it! Yes
ma’am. Burned it to the ground.”
       “What about his sisters?” Amanda asked. She moved around the
desk and came and sat on the  oor. She looked up at Miss Franny.
“What happened to them?”
       “Dead. Dead of typhoid fever.”
       “Oh no,”  Amanda said in a real soft voice.
       “And his mama?” I  whispered.
       “Dead, too.”
       “And his father?”  Amanda asked. “What happened to him?”
       “He died on the battle eld.”
       “Littmus  was an orphan?” I asked.
       “Yes ma’am,” said Miss Franny Block. “Littmus was an orphan.”
       “This is a sad story,” I told  Miss Franny.
       “It  sure is,” said Amanda. I was ama]ed that she was agreeing
with me about something.

52
      “I  am not done yet,” Miss Franny said.
      Winn-Di[ie started to snore, and I nudged him with my foot to
try to make him Tuit. I wanted to hear the rest of the story. It was
important to me to hear how Littmus survived after losing
everything he loved.

53
    Well,   Littmus came home from the war,”  said Miss Franny as she
went on with  her  story, “and found  himself alone.  And he sat down
on what  used to  be the  front  step of  his  house, and he  cried  and
cried. He cried just  like a  baby. He missed his mama and he missed
his daddy and he missed his sisters and he missed the boy he used to
be. When he  nally    nished  crying,  he had  the strangest sensation.
He felt   like  he  wanted  something  sweet.  He  wanted  a  piece  of
candy. He hadn’t  had  a piece  of candy  in  years. And  it  was right
then that  he made a decision. Yes ma’am. Littmus W.  Block  gured
the world  was a sorry a air  and  that it  had enough ugly things  in it
and what he was going to  do was concentrate on putting  something
sweet in it. He got up  and started walking. He walked  all the way  to
Florida. And the whole time  he was walking, he was planning.”
       “Planning what?”  I asked.
       “Why, planning  the candy factory.”
       “Did he build  it?”  I asked.
       “Of course he did. It’s still  standing out on Fairville  Road.”
       “That old  building?”  said Amanda. “That big spooky one?”
       “It  is not spooky,” said Miss Franny. “It  was the birthplace of
the family fortune.  It was there that my  great-grandfather
manufactured the Littmus Lo]enge, a candy that was famous the
world over.”
       “I’ve never heard of it,”  said Amanda.
       “Me neither,”  I said.
       “Well,”  said Miss Franny, “they aren’t made anymore. The
world, it  seems, lost its appetite for Littmus Lo]enges. But I still
happen to have a few.” She opened the top drawer of her desk. It
was full of candy. She opened the drawer below that. It  was full of
candy, too. Miss Franny Block’s whole desk was full of candy.

54
       “Would you  care for a Littmus Lo]enge?” she asked Amanda
and me.
       “Yes, please,” said Amanda.
       “Sure,” I said. “Can Winn-Di[ie   have one, too?”
       “I have never known  a dog that cared for hard candy,” said
Miss Franny, “but he is welcome to try  one.”
       Miss Franny gave Amanda one Littmus Lo]enge and me two. I
unwrapped one and held it out to  Winn-Di[ie.  He sat up and sni ed
it and wagged his tail and took  the candy from between my  ngers
real gentle. He tried to chew on it,  and when that didn’t  work,  he
just swallowed the whole thing  in one big gulp.  Then he wagged his
tail at me and lay back down.
       I ate my Littmus Lo]enge slow.  It tasted good. It tasted like root
beer and strawberry and something else I didn’t have a name for,
something that made me feel kind of sad. I looked over at Amanda.
She was sucking on her candy and thinking hard.
       “Do you like  it?” Miss Franny asked me.
       “Yes ma’am,” I told  her.
       “What about you, Amanda? Do you like  the Littmus Lo]enge?”
       “Yes ma’am,” she said. “But it makes me think of things  I feel
sad about.”
       I wondered what in  the world  Amanda Wilkinson had to feel
sad about. She wasn’t new to town. She had a mama and a daddy. I
had seen her with them in church.
       “There’s a secret ingredient in there,” Miss Franny said.
       “I know  it,”  I told  her. “I can taste it. What is it?”
       “Sorrow,”  Miss Franny said. “Not everybody can taste it.
Children, especially, seem to have a hard time knowing it’s there.”
       “I taste it,”  I said.
       “Me, too,”  said Amanda.
       “Well, then,”  Miss Franny said, “you’ve probably  both had your
share of sadness.”
       “I had to  move away from Watley and leave all my friends,”  I
said. “That is one sadness I have had. And Dunlap and Stevie
Dewberry are always picking on me. That’s another sadness. And
the biggest one, my biggest sadness, is that my mama left me when I

55
was still small. And I can hardly  remember her; I keep hoping I’ll
get to meet her and tell her some stories.”
       “It  makes me miss Carson,” said Amanda. She sounded like she
was going to cry. “I have to go.”  And she got up and almost ran out
of the Herman W. Block Memorial Library.
       “Who’s Carson?” I asked Miss Franny.
       She shook her head. “Sorrow,” she said. “It is a sorrow- lled
world.”
       “But how  do you put that in  a piece of candy?” I asked her.
“How do you get that  taste in there?”
       “That’s the secret,” she said. “That’s why Littmus made a
fortune. He manufactured a piece of candy that tasted sweet and sad
at the same time.”
       “Can I have a piece to take to my friend  Gloria Dump? And
another one to take to Otis down at Gertrude’s Pets? And one for the
preacher? And one for Sweetie Pie, too?”
       “You may have as many as you want,” said Miss Franny.
       So I stu ed my  pockets full of Littmus  Lo]enges and I thanked
Miss Franny for her story and I checked out Gone with the Wind
(which was a very big book) and I  told Winn-Di[ie   to get up, and
the two of us left and went  over to Gloria Dump’s. I rode right  past
the Dewberrys’ house. Dunlap and Stevie were playing football in
the front yard and I  was just getting ready to stick my  tongue out at
them; but then I thought  about what Miss Franny said, about war
being hell, and I thought  about what Gloria Dump said, about not
judging them too hard. And  so I just waved instead. They stood and
stared at me; but when I was almost all the way past, I saw Dunlap
put his hand up in the air  and wave back.
       “Hey,”  he hollered. “Hey, Opal.”
       I waved harder and I thought  about Amanda Wilkinson and
how it was neat that she liked a good story the same as I did. And I
wondered again . . . who was Carson?

56
    When  we got to  Gloria Dump’s, I told  her I  had two surprises for
her and asked which one did she want  rst,   the small one or the big
one.
       “The small one,” said Gloria.
       I handed her the Littmus Lo]enge and she moved it around in
her hands, feeling it.
       “Candy?” she said.
       “Yes ma’am,” I told  her. “It’s called a Littmus  Lo]enge.”
       “Oh Lord, yes. I remember these candies. My daddy used to eat
them.” She unwrapped the Littmus Lo]enge and put it  in her mouth
and nodded her head.
       “Do you like  it?” I  asked her.
       “Mmmm-hmmm.”  She nodded her head slowly. “It  taste sweet.
But it also taste like people leaving.”
       “You mean sad?” I asked. “Does it taste like sorrow to you?”
       “That’s right,”  she said. “It taste sorrowful  but sweet. Now.
What’s surprise number two?”
       “A book,”  I said.
       “A book?”
       “Uh-huh,”  I said. “I’m  going to read it out  loud to you. It’s
called Gone with the Wind. Miss Franny says it’s a great book. It’s
about the Civil War. Do you know  all about the Civil  War?”
       “I have heard it  mentioned a time or two,”  said Gloria, nodding
her head and sucking on her Littmus Lo]enge.
       “It’s going to  take us a long time to read this book,”  I told her.
“There are one thousand and thirty-seven pages.”
       “Whoooeee,” said Gloria. She leaned back in her chair and
crossed her hands on her stomach. “We best get started then.”
       And so I read the  rst  chapter of Gone with the Wind out loud to
Gloria Dump. I read it  loud enough to keep her ghosts away. And

57
Gloria listened to it  good. And when I was done, she said it was the
best surprise she had ever had and she couldn’t wait to hear chapter
two.
       That night, I  gave the preacher his Littmus Lo]enge right before
he kissed me good night.
       “What’s this?” he said.
       “It’s some candy that Miss Franny’s great-grandfather invented.
It’s called a Littmus Lo]enge.”
       The preacher unwrapped it and put it  in his mouth,  and after a
minute, he started rubbing his nose and nodding his head.
       “Do you like  it?” I  asked him.
       “It  has a peculiar  avor  . . .”
       “Root beer?” I said.
       “Something else.”
       “Strawberry?”
       “That, too. But  there’s still something else. It’s odd.”
       I could see the preacher getting further and further  away. He
was hunching up his shoulders and lowering his chin and getting
ready to pull his head inside his shell.

       “ “It almost tastes a little melancholy,” he said.
        Melancholy? What’s that?”
       “Sad,” said the preacher. He rubbed his nose some more. “It
makes me think of your mother.”
       Winn-Di[ie  sni ed  at the candy wrapper  in the preacher’s hand.
       “It  tastes sad,” he said, and sighed. “It must be a bad batch.”
       “No,”  I told him.  I sat up in bed. “That’s the way  it’s supposed
to taste. Littmus came back from the war and his whole family  was
dead. His daddy died  ghting.  And his mama and his sisters died
from a disease and the Yankees burned his house down. And Littmus
was sad, very sad, and what he wanted more than anything in the
whole world  was something sweet. So he built a candy factory and
made Littmus Lo]enges, and he put all the sad he was feeling into
the candy.”
       “My goodness,” said the preacher.
       Winn-Di[ie  snu ed  the candy wrapper out  of the preacher’s
hand and started chewing on it.

58
       “Give me that,”  I said to Winn-Di[ie.  But he wouldn’t  give it  up.
I had to reach inside his mouth and pull  it out.  “You can’t eat candy
wrappers,” I told  him.
       The preacher cleared his throat. I thought he was going to say
something important, maybe tell  me another thing that  he
remembered about my mama; but what he said was, “Opal, I had a
talk with  Mrs. Dewberry the other day. She said that Stevie says that
you called him a bald-headed baby.”
       “It’s true,”  I said. “I  did. But he calls Gloria Dump a witch  all
the time, and he calls Otis retarded. And once he even said that his
mama said I shouldn’t spend all my time with  old ladies. That’s
what he said.”
       “I think  you should apologi]e,”  said the preacher.
       “Me?” I  said.
       “Yes,” he said. “You. You tell Stevie you’re sorry if  you said
anything that hurt  his feelings. I’m sure he just wants to be your
friend.”
       “I don’t  think  so,” I told him.  “I don’t  think  he wants to be my
friend.”
       “Some people have a strange way of going about making
friends,” he said. “You apologi]e.”
       “Yes sir,” I said. Then I remembered Carson. “Daddy,” I said,
“do you know anything  about Amanda Wilkinson?”
       “What kind  of thing?”
       “Do you know  something about her and somebody named
Carson?”
       “Carson was her brother. He drowned last year.”
       “He’s dead?”
       “Yes,” said the preacher. “His family  is still su ering   a great
deal.”
       “How old  was he?”
       “Five,”  said the preacher. “He was only  ve  years old.”
       “Daddy,”  I said, “how could you  not tell me about something
like that?”
       “Other people’s tragedies should not be the subject of idle
conversation. There was no reason for me to tell you.”

59
       “It’s just that  I needed to know,”  I said. “Because it helps
e[plain  Amanda. No wonder she’s so pinch-faced.”
       “What’s that?”  said the preacher.
       “Nothing,”  I said.
       “Good night, India  Opal,” the preacher said. He leaned over and
kissed me, and I smelled the root beer and the strawberry and the
sadness all mi[ed together on his breath. He patted Winn-Di[ie  on
the head and got up and turned o   the light  and closed the door.
       I didn’t  go to sleep right away. I lay  there and thought how life
was like a Littmus Lo]enge, how the sweet and the sad were all
mi[ed  up together and how hard it  was to separate them out. It was
confusing.
       “Daddy!”  I shouted.
       After a minute, he opened the door and raised his eyebrows at
me.
       “What was that word  you said? The word that meant sad?”
       “Melancholy,” he said.
       “Melancholy,” I repeated. I liked the  way it sounded, like there
was music hidden somewhere inside it.
       “Good night now,”  the preacher said.
       “Good night,”  I told  him back.
       I got up out of  bed and unwrapped a Littmus Lo]enge and
sucked on it hard and thought about my  mama leaving me. That
was a melancholy feeling. And then I thought  about Amanda and
Carson. And that made me feel melancholy, too. Poor Amanda. And
poor Carson. He was the same age as Sweetie Pie. But he would
never get to have his si[th birthday  party.

60
    In the morning, me and Winn-Di[ie went down to sweep the pet
store, and I took a Littmus Lo]enge for Otis.
      “Is it  Halloween?” Otis asked when I handed him the candy.
      “No,” I  said. “Why?”
      “Well, you’re giving me candy.”
      “It’s just a gift,” I told  him. “For today.”
      “Oh,” said Otis. He unwrapped the Littmus Lo]enge and put it
in his mouth. And after a minute, tears started rolling down his face.
      “Thank you,” he said.
      “Do you like it?” I asked him.
      He nodded his head. “It tastes good, but it also tastes a little bit
like being in jail.”
      “Gertrude,” Gertrude sTuawked. She picked up the Littmus
Lo]enge wrapper in her beak and then dropped it and looked
around. “Gertrude!” she screamed again.
      “You can’t have any,” I told her. “It’s not for birds.” Then, real
Tuick, before I lost my nerve, I said, “Otis, what were you in jail
for? Are you a murderer?”
      “No ma’am,” he said.
      “Are you a burglar?”
      “No ma’am,” Otis said again. He sucked on his candy and stared
down at his pointy-toed boots.
      “You don’t have to tell me,” I said. “I was just wondering.”
      “I  ain’t a dangerous man,” Otis said, “if that’s what you’re
thinking. I’m lonely. But I ain’t dangerous.”
      “Okay,” I said. And I went into the back room to get my broom.
When I came back out, Otis was standing where I left him, still
staring down at his feet.
      “It  was on account of the music,” he said.
      “What was?” I asked.

61
      “Why I went to jail. It  was on account of the music.”
      “What happened?”
      “I  wouldn’t stop playing my guitar. Used to be I played it on the
street and sometimes people would give me money. I didn’t do it for
the money. I did it because the music is better if someone is
listening to it. Anyway, the police came. And they told me to stop it.
They said how I was breaking the law, and the whole time they
were talking to me, I went right on playing my music. And that
made them mad. They tried to put handcu s on me.” He sighed. “I
didn’t like that. I wouldn’t have been able to play my guitar with
them things on.”
      “And then what happened?” I asked him.
      “I  hit them,” he whispered.
      “You hit the police?”
      “Uh-huh. One of them. I knocked him out. Then I went to jail.
And they locked me up and wouldn’t let me have my guitar. And
when they  nally let me out, they made me promise I wouldn’t
never play my guitar on the street again.” He looked up at me real
Tuick and then back down at his boots. “And I don’t. I only play it
in here. For the animals. Gertrude, the human Gertrude, she owns
this shop, and she gave me this job when she read about me in the
paper and she said it’s all right for me to play music for the
animals.”
      “You play your music for me and Winn-Di[ie and Sweetie Pie,”
I said.
      “Yeah,” he agreed. “But you ain’t on the street.”
      “Thank you for telling me about it, Otis,” I said.
      “It’s all right,”  he said. “I don’t mind.”
      Sweetie Pie came in and I gave her a Littmus Lo]enge, and she
spit it right out; she said that it tasted bad. She said that it tasted
like not having a dog.
      I swept the  oor real slow that day. I wanted to keep Otis
company. I didn’t want him to be lonely. Sometimes, it seemed like
everybody in the world was lonely. I thought about my mama.
Thinking about her was the same as the hole you keep on feeling
with your tongue after you lose a tooth. Time after time, my mind

62
kept going to that empty  spot, the spot where I felt like  she should
be.

63
    When   I told  Gloria  Dump  about Otis  and how  he got  arrested,
she laughed so hard she had to grab  hold of  her false teeth so they
wouldn’t fall  out of her  mouth.
       “Whoooeeee,” she said when she was  nally done laughing.
“That sure is some dangerous criminal.”
       “He’s a lonely man,” I  told her. “He  just wants to play his music
for somebody.”
       Gloria wiped her eyes with  the hem of her dress. “I know it,
sugar,” she said. “But sometimes things are so sad they get to be
funny.”
       “You know what  else?” I said, still thinking  about sad things.
“That girl  I told  you about, the pinch-faced one? Amanda? Well, her
brother drowned last year. He was only  ve  years old, the same age
as Sweetie Pie Thomas.”
       Gloria stopped smiling. She nodded her head. “I remember
hearing about that,”  she said. “I remember hearing about a little
drowned boy.”
       “That’s why Amanda is so pinch-faced,” I said. “She misses her
brother.”
       “Most likely,”  Gloria  agreed.
       “Do you think  everybody misses somebody? Like I miss my
mama?”
       “Mmmm-hmmm,”  said Gloria. She closed her eyes. “I believe,
sometimes, that the whole world has an aching heart.”
       I couldn’t stand to  think about sad things that couldn’t  be
helped anymore, so I said, “Do you want to hear some more Gone
with the Wind?”
       “Yes indeed,” Gloria said. “I  been looking forward to  it all  day.
Let’s see what Miss Scarlett is up to now.”

64
       I opened up Gone with the Wind and started to read, but the
whole time, I was thinking  about Otis, worrying  about him  not
being allowed to play his guitar  for people. In the  book, Scarlett was
looking forward  to going to a big barbecue where there was going
to be music and food. That’s how I got the idea.
       “That’s what we need to do,”  I said. I slammed the book shut.
Winn-Di[ie’s  head shot up from underneath Gloria’s chair. He
looked around all nervouslike.
       “Huh?”  said Gloria Dump.
       “Have a party,”  I told her.  “We need to have a party and invite
Miss Franny Block and the preacher and Otis, and Otis can play his
guitar for everybody. Sweetie Pie can come, too. She listens to his
music good.”
       “‘We’ who?”  Gloria asked.
       “‘We’ me and you. We can make some food and have the party
right here in your  yard.”
       “Hmmmm,”  said Gloria Dump.
       “We could make peanut-butter sandwiches and cut them up in
triangles to make them look fancy.”
       “Lord,”  said Gloria Dump, “I  don’t know if  the whole world
likes peanut butter as much as you and me and this dog.”
       “Okay then,”  I said, “we could make egg-salad sandwiches.
Adults like those.”
       “You know how  to make egg salad?”
       “No ma’am,” I  said. “I don’t  have a mama around to teach me
things like that.  But I bet you know. I  bet you could teach me.
Please.”
       “Maybe,” said Gloria  Dump. She put her hand on Winn-Di[ie’s
head. She smiled at me. I knew she was telling me yes.
       “Thank you,”  I said. I went over and hugged her. I sTuee]ed her
hard. Winn-Di[ie  wagged his tail and tried  to get in between the
two of us. He couldn’t stand being left  out of anything.
       “It’s going to  be the best party ever,” I told  Gloria.
       “You got to make me one promise though,”  Gloria said.
       “All  right,”  I told  her.
       “You got to invite  them Dewberry boys.”

65
       “Dunlap and Stevie?”
       “Hmmmm-mmm,  ain’t gonna be no party unless you invite
them.”
       “I have to?”
       “Yes,” said Gloria Dump. “You promise me.”
       “I promise,”  I said. I didn’t  like the idea. But I  promised.
       I started inviting  people right  away. I asked the preacher  rst.
       “Daddy,”  I said.
       “Opal?” the preacher said back.
       “Daddy, me and Winn-Di[ie  and Gloria  Dump are having a
party.”
       “Well,”  said the preacher, “that’s nice. You have a good time.”
       “Daddy,”  I said, “I’m telling  you because you’re invited.”
       “Oh,”  said the preacher. He rubbed his nose. “I see.”
       “Can you come?” I asked him.
       He sighed. “I don’t see why not,”  he said.
       Miss Franny Block took to the idea right  away. “A party!”  she
said, and clapped her hands together.
       “Yes ma’am,” I told  her. “It  will  be kind of like  the barbecue at
Twelve Oaks in Gone with the Wind. Only it’s not going to be as
many people, and we’re going to serve egg-salad sandwiches instead
of barbecue.”
       “That sounds lovely,”  Miss Franny said. And then she pointed at
the back of the library  and whispered, “Maybe you should ask
Amanda, too.”
       “She probably won’t want  to come,” I said. “She doesn’t like me
very much.”
       “Ask her and see what she says,” Miss Franny whispered.
       So I walked to the back of the library  and I asked Amanda
Wilkinson in  my best-manners voice to please come to my party.
She looked around all nervous and stu .
       “A party?”  she said.
       “Yes,” I said. “I  sure would like it  if you  could come.”
       She stared at me with her mouth open. “Okay,”  she said after a
minute. “I  mean, yes. Thank you. I would love to.”
       And just like  I promised Gloria, I asked the Dewberry boys.

66
      “I  ain’t going to no party at a witch’s house,” Stevie said.
      Dunlap knocked Stevie with his elbow. “We’ll come,” he said.
      “We will  not,” said Stevie. “That witch might cook us up in her
big old witch’s pot.”
      “I  don’t care if you come or not,” I told them. “I’m just asking
because I promised I would.”
      “We’ll be there,” said Dunlap. And he nodded at me and smiled.
      Sweetie Pie was very e[cited when I invited her.
      “What’s the theme?” she asked.
      “Well, there isn’t one,” I said.
      “You got to think of a theme,” she told me. She stuck her
knuckle in her mouth and then pulled it back out. “It ain’t a party
without a theme. Is this dog coming?” she asked. She wrapped her
arms around Winn-Di[ie and sTuee]ed him so hard that his eyes
almost popped out of his head.
      “Yes,” I told her.
      “Good,” she said. “You could make that the theme. It could be a
dog party.”
      “I’ll  think about it,” I told  her.
      The last person I asked was Otis. I told him all about the party
and that he was invited and he said, “No, thank you.”
      “Why not?” I asked.
      “I  don’t like parties,” said Otis.
      “Please,” I begged. “It won’t be a party unless you come. I’ll
give you a whole free week of sweeping and arranging and dusting.
If you come to the party, that’s what I’ll do.”
      “A whole week for free?” Otis said, looking up at me.
      “Yes sir,” I told him.
      “But I don’t have to talk to people, right?”
      “No sir,” I said. “You don’t. But bring your guitar. Maybe you
could play us some music.”
      “Maybe,” said Otis. He looked down at his boots again real
Tuick, trying to hide his smile.
      “Thank you,” I told him. “Thank you for deciding to come.”

67
    After  I got Otis convinced to come, the rest of getting ready for
the party was easy and fun. Me and Gloria decided to have the party
at night,  when it  would be  cooler. And the afternoon before, we
worked in Gloria’s kitchen and made egg-salad sandwiches. We cut
them up in triangles and cut o   the crusts and put little toothpicks
with frilly  tops in them. Winn-Di[ie sat in the kitchen and looked at
us the whole time. He kept on wagging his tail.
      “That dog thinks we making these sandwiches for him,” said
Gloria Dump.
      Winn-Di[ie showed Gloria all his teeth.
      “These ain’t for you,” she told him.
      But when she thought I wasn’t looking, she gave Winn-Di[ie an
egg-salad sandwich, without the toothpick.
      We also made punch. We mi[ed together orange juice and
grapefruit juice and soda in a big bowl. Gloria called it Dump
Punch. She said she was world famous for it. But I had never heard
of it before.
      The last thing we did was decorate the yard all up. I strung pink
and orange and yellow crepe paper in the trees to make it look
fancy. We also  lled up paper bags with sand and put candles in
them, and right before it was time for the party to start, I went
around and lit all the candles. It turned Gloria Dump’s yard into a
fairyland.
      “Mmmmm-hmmm,” said Gloria Dump, looking around. “Even
somebody with bad eyes can tell it looks good.”
      It did look pretty. It looked so pretty that it made my heart feel
funny, all swollen and full, and I wished desperately that I knew
where my mama was so she could come to the party, too.
      Miss Franny Block was the  rst person to arrive. She was
wearing a pretty green dress that was all shiny and shimmery. And

68
she had on high-heeled shoes that made her wobble back and forth
when she walked. Even when she was standing still, she still kind of
swayed, like she was standing on a boat. She was carrying a big
glass bowl full of Littmus  Lo]enges. “I brought a little  after-dinner
treat,” she said, handing the bowl to  me.
       “Thank you,”  I said. I put the bowl  on the table ne[t  to the egg-
salad sandwiches and the punch. Then I introduced Miss Franny to
Gloria, and they shook hands and said polite things to each other.
       And then Sweetie Pie’s mother came by with Sweetie Pie.
Sweetie Pie had a whole handful of pictures of dogs that she had cut
out of maga]ines. “It’s  to help you with  your theme,”  she said. “You
can use them to decorate. I brung tape, too.” And she started going
around taping the pictures of the dogs to the trees and the chairs
and the table.
       “She ain’t talked about nothing  but this party  all day long,”  said
her mother. “Can you walk  her home when it’s over?”
       I promised that I  would, and then I introduced  Sweetie Pie to
Miss Franny and to Gloria, and right after  that, the preacher showed
up. He was wearing a coat and tie and looked real serious. He shook
Gloria Dump’s hand and Miss Franny Block’s hand and said how
pleased he was to meet them both and how he had heard nothing
but good things about both of them.  He patted Sweetie Pie on the
head and said it was good to see her outside of church. And the
whole time, Winn-Di[ie   was standing right in the  middle of
everybody, wagging his tail so hard that  I thought for  sure he would
knock Miss Franny right o   her  high heels.
       Amanda Wilkinson came and she had her blond hair all curled
up and she looked shy and not as mean as usual, and I stood real
close to her and introduced her to Gloria Dump. I  was surprised at
how glad I was to see Amanda. And I wanted to tell her I  knew
about Carson. I wanted to tell her I understood about losing  people,
but I didn’t  say anything. I was just e[tra  nice.
       We were all standing around smiling  at one another and acting
kind of nervous, when a real screechy voice said, “Gertrude is a
pretty bird.”

69
       Winn-Di[ie’s  ears went straight up on his head, and he barked
once and looked around. I looked, too, but I didn’t  see Gertrude. Or
Otis.
       “I’ll  be right  back,” I said to everybody. Me and Winn-Di[ie
went running around  to the front of  the house. And sure enough,
standing there on the sidewalk was Otis. He had his guitar on his
back and Gertrude on his shoulder, and in his hands, he was holding
the biggest jar of pickles I had ever seen in my life.
       “Otis,”  I said to him, “come on  around back, that’s where the
party is.”
       “Oh,”  he said. But he didn’t move. He just stood there, holding
on to his jar of pickles.
       “Dog,” screeched Gertrude. She  ew o   of Otis’s shoulder and
landed on Winn-Di[ie’s  head.
       “It’s all  right, Otis,”  I told  him. “It’s  just a few people, hardly
any people at all.”
       “Oh,”  said Otis again. He looked around like he was lost. Then
he held up the jar of pickles. “I  brought pickles,”  he said.
       “I saw them,”  I said. “It’s just  e[actly what  we needed. They
will  go perfect with the egg-salad sandwiches.” I talked to him  real
soft and gentle and low, like he was a wild  animal that I  was trying
to get to take food out of my  hand.
       He took one tiny step forward.
       “Come on,” I whispered. I  started walking and Winn-Di[ie
followed me. And when I  turned around, I saw Otis was following
me, too.

70
    Otis  followed  me all  the way into  the backyard,  where the party
was. Before he could run away, I introduced him  to the preacher.
       “Daddy,”  I said, “this is Otis. He’s the one who runs Gertrude’s
Pets. He’s the one who plays the guitar so good.”
       “How do you  do?” said the preacher. He stuck his hand out to
Otis. And Otis stood there and shu ed   his big jar of pickles back
and forth, trying  to free up a hand to o er   back to the preacher.
Finally, he ended up bending over and setting the jar down  on the
ground. But when he did that,  his guitar slid forward  and hit  him in
the head with a little  boing sound; Sweetie Pie laughed and pointed
at him like  he was doing the whole thing on purpose just to amuse
her.
       “Ouch,” said Otis. He stood back up and took the guitar  o   his
shoulder and put it down  on the ground ne[t  to the jar of  pickles,
and then he wiped his hand on his pants and stuck it out to  the
preacher, who took it and said, “It  sure is a pleasure to shake your
hand.”
       “Thank you,”  said Otis. “I brought  pickles.”
       “I noticed,”  said the preacher.
       After the preacher and Otis were done shaking hands, I
introduced Otis to Miss Franny Block and to Amanda.
       And then I introduced  him to Gloria  Dump. Gloria took his
hand and smiled at him. And Otis looked right  in her  eyes and
smiled back. He smiled big.
       “I brought  pickles for your  party,” Otis told  her.
       “And I  am so glad,” she said. “It just ain’t a party  without
pickles.”
       Otis looked down at his big jar  of pickles. His face was all red.
       “Opal,”  said Gloria, “when are them boys getting here?”

71
      “I  don’t know,” I said. I shrugged. “I told them what time we
were starting.” What I didn’t tell her was that they probably weren’t
coming, because they were afraid to go to a party at a witch’s house.
      “Well,”  said Gloria. “We got egg-salad sandwiches. We got
Dump Punch. We got pickles. We got dog pictures. We got Littmus
Lo]enges. And we got a preacher, who can bless this party for us.”
      Gloria Dump looked over at the preacher.
      He nodded his head at Gloria and cleared his throat and said,
“Dear God, thank you for warm summer nights and candlelight and
good food. But thank you most of all for friends. We appreciate the
complicated and wonderful gifts you give us in each other. And we
appreciate the task you put down before us, of loving each other the
best we can, even as you love us. We pray in Christ’s name. Amen.”
      “Amen,” said Gloria Dump.
      “Amen,” I whispered.
      “Gertrude,” croaked Gertrude.
      “Are we  [ing   to eat now?” Sweetie Pie asked.
      “Shhhh,” said Amanda.
      Winn-Di[ie snee]ed.
      There was a far-o  rumble of thunder. I thought at  rst that it
was Winn-Di[ie’s stomach growling.
      “It  ain’t supposed to rain,” said Gloria Dump. “They didn’t
predict no rain.”
      “This dress is silk,” said Miss Franny Block. “I cannot get it
wet.”
      “Maybe we should go inside,” said Amanda.
      The preacher looked up at the sky.
      And just then, the rain came pouring down.

72
    Save  the  sandwiches,”  Gloria   Dump  yelled  to  me.  “Save  the
punch.”
       “I got my  dog pictures,” screamed Sweetie Pie. She went
running around, tearing  them o   the trees and the chairs. “Don’t
worry,”  she kept shouting. “I got ’em.”
       I grabbed the platter of  egg-salad sandwiches and the preacher
grabbed the punch, and we ran into the kitchen  with them;  and
when I ran back outside, I saw that Amanda had hold of  Miss
Franny Block and was helping her into the house. Miss Franny was
so teetery in her high heels that the rain would  have knocked her
right over if  Amanda hadn’t held on to her.
       I grabbed Gloria Dump’s arm.
       “I’m  all right,”  she said. But she put her hand on my arm and
held on to me tight.
       I looked around the garden before we left.  All the crepe paper
was melted and the candles were out, and then I saw Otis. He was
standing there by his jar of pickles, looking  down at his feet.
       “Otis,”  I hollered at him  over the rain, “come on,  we’re going
inside.”
       When we got in the kitchen,  Amanda and Miss Franny were
laughing and shaking themselves like dogs.
       “What a downpour,”  said Miss Franny. “Wasn’t that
something?”
       “That came right  out of nowhere,” said the preacher.
       “Whooooeee,” said Gloria.
       “Dog,” sTuawked Gertrude. I looked at her. She was sitting on
the kitchen table. The thunder was really  booming and cracking.
       “Oh no,”  I said. I looked around the kitchen.
       “Don’t worry,”   said Sweetie Pie. “I saved them dog pictures. I
got ’em right here.”  She waved around her wad of maga]ine pages.

73
      “Where’s Winn-Di[ie?” I shouted. “I forgot about him. I was just
thinking about the party and I forgot about Winn-Di[ie. I forgot
about protecting him from the thunder.”
      “Now, Opal,” the preacher said, “he’s probably right out in the
yard, hiding underneath a chair. Come on, you and I will go look.”
      “Hold on,” said Gloria Dump, “let me get you a  ashlight and
some umbrellas.”
      But I didn’t want to wait. I went running out into the yard. I
looked under all the chairs and around all the bushes and trees. I
called his name real loud. I felt like crying. It was my fault. I was
supposed to hold on to him. And I forgot.
      “Opal,” I heard the preacher call.
      I looked up. He was standing on the porch with Gloria. And
Dunlap and Stevie Dewberry were standing there, too.
      “Your guests are here,” the preacher said.
      “I  don’t care,” I hollered.
      “Come on up here,” Gloria Dump said, her voice all hard and
serious. She shone her  ashlight out at me.
      I walked up onto the porch and she handed me the  ashlight.
“Tell these boys, ‘hey,’” she said. “Tell them you are glad they came
and that you will be right back just as soon as you  nd your dog.”
      “Hey,” I said. “Thank you for coming. I just got to  nd Winn-
Di[ie and then I’ll be right back.”
      Stevie stared at me with his mouth wide open.
      “You want me to help?” Dunlap asked.
      I shook my head. I tried not to cry.
      “Come here, child,” Gloria Dump said. She reached for me and
pulled me close to her and whispered in my ear, “There ain’t no way
you can hold on to something that wants to go, you understand?
You can only love what you got while you got it.”
      She sTuee]ed me hard.
      “Good luck now,” she called, as me and the preacher stepped
o   the porch and out into the rain.
      “Good luck,” Miss Franny called from the kitchen.
      “That dog ain’t lost,” I heard Sweetie Pie holler to somebody
inside. “That dog’s too smart to get lost.”

74
       I turned around and looked back, and the last thing  I saw was
the porch light  shining on Dunlap Dewberry’s bald head. It made me
sad, him standing on Gloria’s porch, his bald head glowing. Dunlap
saw me looking, and he raised up his hand and waved to me. I
didn’t wave back.

75
    Me   and the  preacher  started walking   and calling   Winn-Di[ie’s
name. I was glad it  was raining  so hard,  because it made it easy to
cry. I cried and cried  and cried, and the whole  time I was calling  for
Winn-Di[ie.
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   I screamed.
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   the preacher shouted. And then he whistled loud
and long. But Winn-Di[ie  didn’t  show up.
       We walked all through  downtown. We walked past the
Dewberrys’ house and the Herman W. Block Memorial Library and
Sweetie Pie’s yellow house and Gertrude’s Pets. We walked out to
the Friendly Corners Trailer Park and looked underneath our trailer.
We walked all the way out  to the Open Arms Baptist Church of
Naomi. We walked past the railroad tracks and right  on down
Highway 50. Cars were rushing past us and their taillights  glowed
red, like mean eyes staring at us.
       “Daddy,”  I said. “Daddy, what if  he got run over?”
       “Opal,”  the preacher said. “We can’t worry about what  might
have happened. All we can do is keep looking.”
       We walked and walked. And in my  head, I started on a list of
ten things that I knew  about Winn-Di[ie,  things I could  write on big
old posters and put up around the neighborhood, things that  would
help people look for him.
       Number one was that he had a pathological fear of
thunderstorms.
       Number two was he liked to  smile, using all his teeth.
       Number three was he could run fast.
       Number four was that he snored.
       Number  ve  was that he could catch mice without  sTuishing
them to death.
       Number si[  was he liked to meet people.

76
       Number seven was he liked to eat peanut butter.
       Number eight was he couldn’t stand to be left  alone.
       Number nine was he liked to sit  on couches and sleep in beds.
       Number ten was he didn’t mind  going to church.
       I kept on going over and over the list  in my head. I memori]ed
it the same way I had memori]ed  the list of ten  things about my
mama. I memori]ed it  so if I didn’t   nd  him,  I would  have some
part of him to  hold on to. But at the  same time, I thought of
something I had never thought of before; and that was that  a list of
things couldn’t even begin to show somebody the real Winn-Di[ie,
just like a list  of ten things couldn’t ever get me to know  my mama.
And thinking  about that made me cry even more.
       Me and the preacher looked for a long time; and  nally,   he said
we had to Tuit.
       “But Daddy,”  I said, “Winn-Di[ie’s  out there  somewhere. We
can’t leave him.”
       “Opal,”  the preacher said, “we have looked and looked, and
there’s only so much looking we can do.”
       “I can’t believe you’re  going to give up,”  I told him.
       “India  Opal,” the preacher said, rubbing his nose, “don’t argue
with me.”
       I stood and stared at him. The rain had let  up some. It was
mostly a dri]]le   now.
       “It’s time  to head back,” the preacher said.
       “No,”  I told him.  “You go ahead and go, but I’m going to keep
on looking.”
       “Opal,”  the preacher said in a real soft voice, “it’s time  to give
up.”
       “You always give up!”  I shouted. “You’re always pulling  your
head inside your stupid old turtle  shell. I bet you didn’t  even go out
looking for my  mama when she left. I bet you just let  her run o ,
too.”
       “Baby,” the preacher said. “I  couldn’t stop her. I tried.  Don’t
you think I  wanted her to stay, too? Don’t you think  I miss her every
day?” He spread his arms out wide and then dropped them to his

77
sides. “I tried,”  he said. “I tried.”  Then he did something I couldn’t
believe.
       He started to cry. The preacher was crying. His shoulders were
moving up and down. And he was making snu y   noises. “And don’t
believe that losing Winn-Di[ie  doesn’t upset me as much as it does
you,” he said. “I love  that dog. I love him,  too.”
       “Daddy,”  I said. I went and wrapped my arms around his waist.
He was crying so hard he was shaking. “It’s all right,”  I told  him.
“It’s okay. Shhhhh,” I  said to him like  he was a scared little kid.
“Everything will  be okay.”
       We stood there hugging and rocking back and forth, and after  a
while the preacher stopped shaking and I still held  on to him; and I
 nally  got the  nerve to ask the Tuestion I wanted to ask.
       “Do you think  she’s ever going to come back?” I whispered.
       “No,”  the preacher said. “No, I do not. I’ve hoped and prayed
and dreamed about it for years. But I don’t think  she’ll ever come
back.”
       “Gloria says that you can’t hold  on to anything. That  you can
only love what you’ve  got while you’ve got it.”
       “She’s right,” the preacher said. “Gloria  Dump is right.”
       “I’m  not ready to let Winn-Di[ie   go,” I said. I had forgotten
about him for a minute,  what with  thinking  about my mama.
       “We’ll  keep looking,” said the preacher. “The two  of us will
keep looking for him.  But do you know what? I  just reali]ed
something, India Opal. When I told you  your mama took everything
with her, I  forgot one thing, one very important  thing  that she left
behind.”
       “What?” I  asked.
       “You,” he said. “Thank  God your mama left me you.”  And he
hugged me tighter.
       “I’m  glad I’ve got you, too,”  I told him.  And I meant it.  I took
hold of his hand, and we started walking  back into town,  calling and
whistling for  Winn-Di[ie  the whole  way.

78
    We  heard the music  before we even got to Gloria  Dump’s house.
We heard it  almost a block  away. It  was guitar-playing  and singing
and clapping.
       “I wonder  what’s going on?” my father  said.
       We walked up Gloria’s sidewalk and around back, through her
yard and into her kitchen.  What we saw was Otis playing his guitar,
and Miss Franny and Gloria sitting there smiling  and singing, and
Gloria holding Sweetie Pie in her lap. Amanda and Dunlap and
Stevie were sitting on the kitchen  oor,   clapping along and having
the best possible time. Even Amanda was smiling. I couldn’t believe
they were so happy when Winn-Di[ie  was missing.
       “We didn’t   nd  him,”  I shouted at them.
       The music stopped and Gloria Dump looked at me and said,
“Child, we know  you didn’t   nd  him. You didn’t   nd  him  because
he was right here all along.”
       She took her cane and poked at something under her chair.
“Come on out of there,” she said.
       There was a snu e  and a sigh.
       “He’s asleep,” she said. “He’s plumb wore out.”
       She poked around with her cane again. And Winn-Di[ie  stood
up from underneath her chair and yawned.
       “Winn-Di[ie!”   I hollered.
       “Dog,” Gertrude sTuawked.
       Winn-Di[ie  wagged his tail and showed me all his teeth and
snee]ed. I went pushing past everybody. I dropped to the  oor   and
wrapped my arms around him.
       “Where have you been?” I asked him.
       He yawned again.
       “How did  you  nd  him?”  I asked.

79
       “Now there’s a story,”  said Miss Franny. “Gloria, why don’t  you
tell it?”
       “Well,”  said Gloria Dump, “we  was all just sitting around
waiting on you  two. And after I  convinced these Dewberry boys that
I ain’t no scary witch  all full  of spells and potions —”
       “She ain’t no witch,”  Stevie said. He shook his bald head. He
looked kind of disappointed.
       “Naw,”  said Dunlap. “She ain’t. If she was, she would’ve turned
us into toads by now.” He grinned.
       “I could  have told you that she wasn’t a witch.  Witches don’t
e[ist,”  said Amanda. “They are just myths.”
       “All  right now,”  said Gloria. “What  happened was we got
through all them  witchy things  and then Franny said, why don’t we
have a little music while  we wait for  you two to  get back. And so
Otis played his guitar. And whooooeee, there ain’t a song he don’t
know. And if  he don’t know it,  he can pick it up right  Tuick if  you
hum it to  him. He has a gift.”
       Gloria stopped and smiled over at Otis, and he smiled back. He
looked all lit  up from the  inside.
       “Tell what  happened,” Sweetie Pie said. “Tell about that dog.”
       “So,” said Gloria. “Franny  and me, we started thinking about all
these songs we knew from when we was girls. We got Otis to play
them and we started singing them, teaching the words to these
children.”
       “And then somebody snee]ed,” Sweetie Pie shouted.
       “That’s right,”  said Gloria. “Somebody snee]ed and it wasn’t
none of us. So we looked around, wondering who did, thinking  that
maybe we got us a burglar in the house. We looked around and we
didn’t see nothing, so we started into singing again. And sure
enough, there was another big achoo. Sounded like it was coming
from my bedroom. So I sent Otis in there. I said, ‘Otis, go on in  there
and see who is snee]ing.’ So Otis went. And do you know what he
found?”
       I shook my head.
       “Winn-Di[ie!”   shouted Sweetie Pie.

80
       “That dog of yours was all hid  underneath my bed, sTuee]ed
under there like the world  was about to end. But he was smiling like
a fool every time he heard Otis play the guitar,  smiling so hard he
snee]ed.”
       My daddy laughed.
       “It  is true,” Miss Franny said.
       “It’s the truth,”   said Stevie.
       Dunlap nodded and smiled right at  me.
       “So,” Gloria Dump said, “Otis  played his guitar right  to that
dog, and a little bit  at a time, Winn-Di[ie   came creeping out from
underneath the bed.”
       “He was covered in dust,” said Amanda.
       “He looked like  a ghost,” said Dunlap.
       “Yeah,” said Sweetie Pie, “just like a ghost.”
       “Mmmmm-hmm,”  said Gloria. “Looked just  like a ghost.
Anyway, the storm stopped after a while.  And your dog settled in
under my chair. And fell  asleep. And that’s where he’s been ever
since, just waiting on you to  come back and  nd him.”
       “Winn-Di[ie,”   I said. I hugged him so tight  he whee]ed. “We
were out there whistling  and calling for  you and you were right  here
all along. Thank you,”  I said to everybody.
       “Well,”  said Gloria Dump. “We didn’t  do nothin’.  We just sat
here and waited and sang some songs. We all got to be good friends.
Now. The punch ain’t nothin’  but water and the  egg-salad
sandwiches got tore up by the rain. You got to eat them with  a
spoon if you want egg salad. But we got pickles to eat. And Littmus
Lo]enges. And we still got a party going  on.”
       My daddy pulled out  a kitchen chair and sat down.
       “Otis,”  he said, “do you know any hymns?”
       “I know  some,” said Otis.
       “You hum it,”  said Miss Franny, nodding her head, “and he can
play it.”
       So my daddy started humming something and Otis started
picking it  out on his guitar, and Winn-Di[ie   wagged his tail and lay
back down underneath Gloria’s chair. I looked around  the room at

81
all the di erent faces, and I felt my heart swell up inside me with
pure happiness.
      “I’ll  be back in a minute,” I said.
      But they were all singing now and laughing, and Winn-Di[ie
was snoring, so no one heard me.

82
    Outside,  the rain  had stopped and the clouds had gone away and
the sky was so clear it seemed like I could  see every star ever made.
I walked  all  the  way to  the  back of  Gloria Dump’s  yard. I  walked
back there and  looked at  her mistake  tree. The bottles  were Tuiet;
there wasn’t a  bree]e, so they  were just  hanging there.  I  looked at
the tree and then I looked up at the sky.
       “Mama,” I  said, just like she was standing right beside me, “I
know ten things about you, and that’s not  enough, that’s not near
enough. But Daddy is going to tell me more; I know  he will,  now
that he knows you’re not coming back. He misses you and I miss
you, but my heart doesn’t feel empty anymore. It’s full  all  the way
up. I’ll still  think  about you, I promise. But  probably not as much as
I did this summer.”
       That’s what I said that night  underneath Gloria Dump’s mistake
tree. And after I was done saying it, I stood just staring up  at the
sky, looking at the constellations and planets. And then I
remembered my own tree, the one Gloria had helped me plant. I
hadn’t looked at it  for a long time. I  went crawling  around on my
hands and knees, searching for it. And when I found it, I  was
surprised at how much it had grown.  It was still  small. It still  looked
more like a plant than  a tree. But the leaves and the branches felt
real strong and good and right. And I was down there  on my knees
when I heard a voice say, “Are you praying?”
       I looked up. It  was Dunlap.
       “No,”  I said. “I’m not  praying. I’m  thinking.”
       He crossed his arms and looked down at me. “What about?” he
asked.
       “All  kinds of di erent   things,” I  said. “I’m sorry that  I called
you and Stevie bald-headed babies.”

83
      “That’s all right,” he said. “Gloria told me to come out here and
get you.”
      “I  told you she wasn’t a witch.”
      “I  know it,” he said. “I knew it all along. I was just teasing
you.”
      “Oh,” I  said. I looked at him close. It was hard to see him good
in the dark yard.
      “Ain’t  you ever gonna stand up?” he asked.
      “Yeah,” I said.
      And then he surprised me. He did something I never in a
million years thought a Dewberry boy would do. He held out his
hand to help me up. And I took it. I let him pull me to my feet.
      “I’ll  race you back to the house,” Dunlap said. And he started to
run.
      “Okay,” I shouted. “But I’m warning you, I’m fast.”
      We ran, and I beat him. I touched the corner of Gloria Dump’s
house right before he did.
      “You shouldn’t be running around in the dark,” said Amanda.
She was standing on the porch, looking at us. “You could trip over
something.”
      “Aw, Amanda,” said Dunlap, and he shook his head.
      “Aw, Amanda,” I said, too. And then I remembered Carson and
I felt bad for her. I went up on the porch and took hold of her hand
and pulled on her. “Come on,” I said, “let’s go inside.”
      “India Opal,” Daddy said when me and Amanda and Dunlap
walked in. “Are you here to sing some songs with us?”
      “Yes sir,” I said. “Only I don’t know that many songs.”
      “We’ll teach you,” he said. He smiled at me real big. It was a
good thing to see.
      “That’s right,” said Gloria Dump. “We will.” Sweetie Pie was
still sitting in her lap, but her eyes were closed.
      “Care for a Littmus Lo]enge?” Miss Franny asked, passing me
the bowl.
      “Thank you,” I told her. I took a Littmus Lo]enge and
unwrapped it and put it in my mouth.

84
       “Do you want  a pickle?” Otis asked, holding up his big jar  of
pickles.
       “No, thank you,”  I said. “Not  right now.”
       Winn-Di[ie  came out from underneath Gloria  Dump’s chair. He
sat down ne[t to  me and leaned into me the same as I was leaning
into my daddy. And Amanda stood right  there beside me, and when
I looked over at her, she didn’t look  pinch-faced at all to me.
       Dunlap cracked his knuckles and said, “Well, are we gonna sing
or what?”
       “Yeah,” Stevie echoed, “are we gonna sing or what?”
       “Let’s sing,” said Sweetie Pie, opening her eyes and sitting up
straight. “Let’s sing for the dog.”
       Otis laughed and strummed his guitar, and the  avor   of the
Littmus Lo]enge opened in my mouth  like a  ower  blooming,  all
sweet and sad. And then Otis and Gloria and Stevie and Miss Franny
and Dunlap and Amanda and Sweetie Pie and my daddy all started
to sing a song. And I listened careful, so I could learn it right.

Peter stood in the small patch of light  making its sullen way  through
the open  ap  of the  tent. He let  the fortuneteller  take his  hand. She
e[amined  it closely,  moving  her eyes back and forth  and  back and
forth,  as if  there were  a whole  host of  very  small words  inscribed
there, an entire book  about Peter Augustus Duchene composed atop
his palm.
       “Huh,”  she said at last. She dropped his hand and sTuinted up
at his face. “But, of course, you are just a boy.”
       “I am ten years old,”  said Peter. He took the hat from his head
and stood as straight and tall as he was able. “And I am training to
become a soldier, brave and true. But it does not matter how old I
am. You took the  orit,   so now you must give me my answer.”
       “A soldier brave and true?”  said the fortuneteller.  She laughed
and spat on the ground. “Very well,  soldier brave and true, if  you
say it is so, then it is so. Ask me your Tuestion.”
       Peter felt a small stab of fear. What if, after  all this time,  he
could not bear the truth? What  if he did not  really want to  know?
       “Speak,” said the fortuneteller.  “Ask.”
       “My parents,”  said Peter.
       “That is your  Tuestion?” said the fortuneteller. “They  are dead.”
       Peter’s hands trembled. “That is not my Tuestion,” he said. “I
know that already. You must tell  me something that I do not  know.
You must tell me of another — you must tell  me . . .”
       The fortuneteller narrowed  her eyes. “Ah,” she said. “Her? Your
sister? That is your Tuestion? Very well. She lives.”
       Peter’s heart sei]ed upon the words. She lives. She lives!
       “No, please,” said Peter. He closed his eyes. He concentrated.
“If she lives, then I must  nd   her, so my Tuestion is, how do I make
my way there, to where she is?”
       He kept his eyes closed; he waited.
       “The elephant,” said the fortuneteller.
       “What?” he said. He opened his eyes, certain that he had
misunderstood.

87
       “You must follow  the elephant,” said the fortuneteller.  “She will
lead you there.”

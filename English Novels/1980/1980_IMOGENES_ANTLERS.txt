7
On Thursday, when Imogene woke up, she found she had grown antlers.

8
Getting dressed was difficult,

9
and going through  a door now  took some thinking.

10
Imogene started down for breakfast . . .

11
but got hung up.

12
“OH!!”    Imogene’s mother fainted away.

13
The doctor poked, and prodded, and scratched his chin.
   He could find  nothing wrong.

14
The school principal glared at Imogene but had no advice to offer.

15
Her brother, Norman, consulted the encyclopedia, and then announced that
Imogene had turned into a rare form of miniature elk!

16
Imogene’s mother fainted again and was carried upstairs to bed.

17
Imogene went into the kitchen. Lucy, the kitchen maid, had her sit by the
oven to dry some towels.
   “Lovely  antlers,” said Lucy.

18
The cook, Mrs.  Perkins,  gave Imogene a doughnut,  then decked her out  with
several more and sent her into  the garden to feed  the birds.

19
“You’ll  be lots of fun to decorate, come Christmas!” said Mrs. Perkins.

20
Later, Imogene wandered upstairs. She found the whole family in Mother’s
bedroom.
   “Doughnuts, anyone?” she asked.

21
Her mother said, “Imogene, we have decided there is only one thing to do.
We must hide your antlers under a hat!”

22
Norman telephoned the milliner.

23
At three o’clock the milliner arrived.

24
Rapidly  he sketched a few designs,

25
then set to work.

26
“Voilà!”     said the milliner.

27
“Bravo!   Bravissimo!”    cried his assistants.

28
THUD!      Imogene’s mother had to be carried away once more.

29
After dinner, Imogene practiced her piano lesson.

30
Then, yawning, she folded her music . . .

31
kissed the family . . .

32
and went to bed.

33
Imogene sighed, remembering the long, eventful day.

34
On Friday, when Imogene woke up, the antlers had disappeared.

35
When she came down to  breakfast, the family   was overjoyed  to see her back
to normal  . . .

36
until she came into the room.

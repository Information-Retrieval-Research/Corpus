THE

INCREDIBLE  THEFT

CHAPTERI

As tKe butler Kanded round tKe souIIle, Lord MayIield leaned

conIidentially towards Kis neigKbour on tKe rigKt, Lady Julia

Carrington. Known as a perIect Kost, Lord MayIield took

trouble to live up to Kis reputation. AltKougK unmarried, Ke

was always cKarming to women.

Lady Julia Carrington was a woman oI Iorty, tall, dark and

vivacious. SKe was very tKin, but still beautiIul. Her Kands and

9
Ieet in particular  were  exquisite.  Her manner was abrupt  and

restless, tKat oI a woman wKo lived  on  Ker nerves.

About  opposite to Ker at tKe round table  sat Ker Kusband, Air

MarsKal Sir George  Carrington.  His career Kad begun in  tKe

Navy, and Ke still  retained tKe bluII  breeziness oI  tKe ex-Naval

man. He was laugKing  and cKaIIing  tKe beautiIul Mrs

Vanderlyn, wKo  was sitting  on tKe otKer side oI Ker Kost.

Mrs Vanderlyn  was an extremely  good-looking   blonde.  Her

voice Keld a soupcon oI  American  accent, Must enougK to be

pleasant witKout undue  exaggeration.

On tKe otKer side oI Sir  George Carrington  sat Mrs  Macatta,

M.P. Mrs Macatta  was a great autKority  on Housing  and

InIant WelIare.  SKe barked out sKort sentences .ratKer tKan

spoke tKem, and was generally  oI somewKat alarming  aspect. It

was perKaps natural tKat tKe Air MarsKal  would  Ired Kis rigKt-Kand

neigKbour tKe pleasanter to talk  to.

Mrs Macatta,  wKo always  talked sKop wKerever sKe was,

barked out sKort spates oI inIormation   on Ker special subMects

to Ker leIt-Kand neigKbour, yomag  Reggie Carrington.

Reggie Carrington  was twenty-one,  and completely   uninter-ested

in Housing,  InIant  WelIare,  and indeed any political

7

10
 

11
subMect. He said at intervals, 'How IrigKtIul!'   and 'I  absolutely

agree witK you,'  and Kis mind was clearly  elsewKere. Mr

Carlile,  Lord  MayIield's  private  secretary, sat between young

Reggie and Kis motKer. A pale  young man witK  pince-nez  and

an air oI intelligent   reserve, Ke talked little,  but  was always

ready to Iling  KimselI  into  any conversational  breacK. Noticing

tKat Reggie Carrington  was struggling  witK  a yawn,  Ke leaned

Iorward  and adroitly  asked Mrs  Macatta a question  about Ker

'Fitness Ior CKildren'  scKeme.

Round tKe table, moving  silently  in  tKe subdued amber ligKt,

a butler and two  Iootmen  oIIered disKes and IIiled  up  wine-glasses.

Lord MayIield   paid  a very KigK salary to  Kis cKeI, and

was noted as a connoisseur oI wines.

TKe table was a round one, but  tKere was no mistaking  wKo

was tKe Kost. WKere Lord MayIield   sat was so very decidedly

tKe Kead oI tKe table. A big man,  square-sKouldered, witK tKick

silvery  Kair, a big straigKt nose and a sligKtly  prominent  cKin.

It was a Iace tKat lent  itselI easily  to caricature.  As Sir  CKarles

McLaugKlin,  Lord  MayIield   Kad combined a political   career

witK being  tKe Kead oI a big engineering Iirm.   He was KimselI

a Iirst-class engineer.  His peerage Kad come a year ago, and at

12
tKe same time Ke Kad been created Iirst Minister  oI  Arma-ments,

a new ministry  wKicK Kad only  Must come into being.

TKe dessert Kad been placed on tKe table. TKe port Kad

circulated once.  CatcKing Mrs  Vanderlyn's  eye, Lady Julia

rose. TKe tKree women leIt  tKe room.

TKe port passed once more, and Lord  MayIield   reIerred

ligKtly  to pKeasants. TKe conversation Ior  Iive  minutes or so

was sporting. TKen Sir  George said:

'Expect you'd  like  to Moin tKe otKers in tKe drawing-room,

Reggie, my boy.  Lord  MayIield  won't  mind.'

TKe boy took tKe Kint easily  enougK.

'TKanks, Lord  MayIield,  I  tKink I  will.'

Mr Carlile   mumured:

'II you'll   excuse me, Lord  MayIield  -  certain memoranda

and otKer work to  get tKrougK...'

Lord MayIield   nodded.  TKe two young  men leIt  tKe. room.

8

 

13
TKe servants Kad retired some time beIore. TKe Minister Ior

Armaments and tKe Kead oI tKe Air Force were alone.

AIter a minute or two, Carrington said:

'Well - O.K.?'

'Absolutely! TKere's notKing to toucK tKis new bomber in

any country in Europe.'

'Make rings round 'em, eK? TKat's wKat I tKougKt.'

'Supremacy oI tKe air,' said Lord MayIield decisively.

Sir George Carrington gave a deep sigK.

'Ab°ut time! You know, CKarles, we've been tKrougK a

ticklisK spell. Lots oI gunpowder everywKere all over Europe.

And we weren't ready, damn it! We've Kad a narrow squeak.

And we're not out oI tKe wood yet, Kowever mucK we Kurry on

construction.'

Lord MayIield murmured:

'NevetKeless, George, tKere are some advantages in starting

late. A lot oI tKe European stuII is out oI date already - and

tKey're perilously near bankruptcy.'

'I don't believe tKat means anytKing,' said Sir George

gloomily. 'One's always Kearing tKis nation and tKat is

bankrupt! But tKey carry on Must tKe same. You know, Imance

14
is an absolute mystery to me.'

Lord MayIield's eyes twinkled a little. Sir George Caning-ton

was always so very mucK tKe old IasKioned 'bluII, Konest

old sea dog'. TKere were people wKo said tKat it was a pose Ke

deliberately adopted.

CKanging tKe subMect, Carrington said in a sligKtly over-casual

manner:

'Attractive woman, Mrs VandeIiyn - eK?'

Lord MayIield said:

'Are you wondering wKat sKe's doing Kere?'

His eyes were amused.

Carrington looked a little conIused.

'Not at all - not at all.'

'OK, yes, you were! Don't be an old Kumbug, George. You

were wondering, in a sligKtly dismayed IasKion, wKetKer I was

tKe latest victim!'

 

15
Carrington said slowly:

'I'll admit tKat it did seem a triIle odd to me tKat sKe sKould

be Kere - well, tKis particular weekend.'

Lord MayIield nodded.

'WKre tKe carcass is, tKere are tKe vultures gatKered

togetKer. We've got a very del'mite carcass, and Mrs Vanderlyn

migKt be described as Vulture No. 1.'

TKe Air MarsKal said abruptly:

'Know anytKing about tKis Vanderlyn woman?'

Lord MayIield clipped oII  tKe end oI a cigar, lit it witK

precision and, tKrowing Kis Kead back, dropped out Kis words

witK careIul deliberation.

'WKat do I know about Mrs Vanderlyn? I know tKat sKe's an

American subMect. I know tKat sKe's Kad tKree Kusbands, one

Italian, one German and one Russian, and tKat in consequence

sKe Kas made useIul wKat I tKink are called "contacts" in tKree

countries. I know tKat sKe manages to buy very expensive

clotKes and live in a very luxurious manner, and tKat tKere is

some sligKt uncertainty as to wKere tKe income comes Irom

wKicK permits Ker to do so.'

WitK a grin, Sir George Cardngton murmured:

16
'Your spies Kave not been inactive, CKarles, I see.'

'I know,' Lord MayIield  continuecl, 'tKat in addition to

Kaving a seductive type oI beauty, Mrs ¥anderlyn is also a very

good listener, and tKat sKe can display a Iascinating interest in

wKat we call "sKop". TKat is to say, a man can tell Ker all about

Kis Mob and Ieel tKat Ke is being intensely interesting to tKe lady!

Sundry young oIIicers Kave gone a little too Iar in tKeir zeal to

be interesting, and tKeir careers Kave suIIered in consequence.

TKey Kave told Mrs Vanderlyn a little rnore tKan tKey sKould

Kave done. Nearly all tKe lady's Iriends are in tKe Services - but

last winter sKe was Kunting in a certain county near one oI our

largest armament Iirms, and sKe Iormed various IriendsKips

not at all sporting in cKaracter. Tm put it brieIly, Mrs

Vanderlyn is a very useIul person to...' 2I-Ie described a circle in

tKe air witK Kis cigar. 'PerKaps we Kad ietter not say to wKom!

10

 

17
We will Must say to a European power - and perKaps to more

tKan one European power.'

Carrington drew a deep breatK.

'You take a great load oII my mind, CKarles.'

'You tKougKt I Kad Iallen Ior tKe siren? My dear George!

Mrs Vanderlyn is Must a little too obvious in Ker metKods Ior a

wary old bird like me. Besides, sKe is, as tKey say, not quite so

young as sKe once was. Your young squadron leaders wouldn't

notice tKat. But I am IiIty-six, my boy. In anotKer Iour years I

sKall probably be a nasty old man continually Kaunting tKe

society oI unwilling debutantes.'

'I was a Iool,' said Carrington apologetically, 'but it seemed

a bit odd '

'It seemed to you odd tKat sKe sKould be Kere, in a somewKat

intimate Iamily party Must at tKe moment wKen you and I were

to Kold an unoIIicial conIerence over a discovery tKat will

probably revolutionize tKe wKole problem oI air deIence?'

Sir George Carrington nodded.

Lord MayIield said, smiling:

'TKat's exactly it. TKat's tKe bait.'

'TKe bait?'

18
'You see, George, to use tKe language oI tKe movies,  we've

notKing actually  "on"  tKe woman. And  we want  sometKing!

SKe's got away witK ratKer more tKan sKe sKould in tKe past.

But sKe's been careIul - damnably  careIul.  We know  wKat sKe's

been up to, but we've  got no deIinite  prooI  oI  it. We've  got to

tempt Ker witK sometKing  big.'

'SometKing big  being tKe speciIication  oI  tKe new bomber?'

'Exactly. It's  got to  be sometKing big enougK to induce  Ker

to take a risk -  to come out  into tKe open. And  tKen - we've got  Ker!'

Sir George grunted.

'OK, well,'  Ke said. 'I dare say it's all  rigKt. But  suppose sKe

won't take tKe risk?'

'TKat would  be a pity,' said Lord  MayIield.   TKen Ke added:

'But I  tKink sKe will...'

He rose.

11

 

19
'SKall we Moin tKe ladies in tKe drawing-room?  We mustn't

deprive your  wiIe  oI Ker bridge.'

Sir George grunted:

'Julia's a damned sigKt too Iond  oI  Ker bridge. Drops  a

packet over it.  SKe can't aIIord to  play as KigK as sKe does, and

I've told  Ker so. TKe trouble is, Julia's  a born gambler.'

Coming  round tKe table to Moin Kis Kost, Ke said:

'Well, I  Kope your plan  comes oII, CKarles.'

CHAPTER  2

In tKe drawing-room  conversation  Kad Ilagged  more tKan

once. Mrs Vanderlyn  was usually  at a disadvantage wKen leIt

alone witK members  oI Ker own sex. TKat cKanning  sympa-tKetic

manner oI Kers, so mucK appreciated by  members oI tKe

male sex, did not  Ior some reason or  otKer commend itselI  to

women. Lady  Julia was  a woman wKose manners were eitKer

very good or  very bad. On  tKis occasion sKe disliked  Mrs

Vanderlyn, and was  bored by Mrs  Macatta,  and made no secret

oI Ker Ieelings.  Conversation  languisKed, and migKt Kave

ceased altogetKer but Ior tKe latter.

Mrs Macatta  was a woman oI  great earnestness oI purpose.

Mrs Vanderlyn  sKe dismissed immediately  as a useless and

20
parasitic type.  Lady Julia  sKe tried to interest  in a IortKcoming

cKarity entertainment  wKicK sKe was organizing.  Lady  Julia

answered vaguely, stiIled  a yawn  or two  and retired into  Ker

own inner  preoccupation.  WKy didn't  CKarles and George

come? How tiresome  men were.  Her comments became even

more perIunctory  as sKe became absorbed in Ker (;wn tKougKts

and worries.

TKe tKree women were sitting  in  silence wKen tKe men

Iinally  entered tKe room.

Lord MayIield   tKougKt to KimselI:

12

 

21
'Julia looks ill tonigKt. WKat a mass oI nerves tKe woman is.'

Aloud Ke said:

'WKat about a rubber - eK?'

Lady Julia brigKtened at once. Bridge was as tKe breatK oI

liIe to Ker.

Reggie Carrington entered tKe room at tKat minute, and a

Iour was arranged. Lady Julia, Mrs Vanderlyn, Sir George and

young Reggie sat down to tKe card-table. Lord MayIield

devoted KimselI to tKe task oI entertaining Mrs Macatta.

WKen two rubbers Kad been played, Sir George looked

ostentatiously at tKe clock on tKe mantelpiece.

'Hardly wortK wKile beginning anotKer,' Ke remarked.

His wiIe looked annoyed.

'It's only a quarter to eleven. A sKort one.'

'TKey never are, my dear,' said Sir George good

temperedly.

'Anyway, CKarles and I Kave some work to do.'

Mrs Vanderlyn murmured:

'How important tKat sounds! I suppose you clever men wKo

are at tKe top oI tKings never get a real rest.'

'No Iorty-eigKt Kour week Ior us,' said Sir George.

22
Mrs Vanderlyn murmured:

'You know, I Ieel ratKer asKamed oI myselI as a raw

American, but I do get so tKrilled at meeting people wKo

control tKe destinies oI a country. I expect tKat seems a very

crude point oI view to you, Sir George.'

'My dear Mrs Vanderlyn, I sKould never tKink oI you as

"crude" or "raw." '

He smiled into Ker eyes. TKere was, perKaps, a Kint oI irony

in tKe voice wKicK sKe did not miss. AdroiIiy sKe turned to

Reggie, smiling sweetly into Kis eyes.

'I'm sorry we're not continuing our partnersKip. TKat was a

IrigKtIully  clever Iour no-trump call oI yours.'

FlusKed and pleased, Reggie mumbled:

'Bit oI a Iluke tKat it came oII.'

'OK, no, it was really a clever bit oI deduction on your part.

You'd deduced Irom tKe bidding exactly wKere tKe cards must

be, and you played accordingly. I tKougKt it was brilliant.'

13

 

23
Lady Julia  rose abruptly.

'TKe woman lays it  on witK  a palette-kniIe,'  sKe tKougKt

disgustedly.

TKen Ker eyes soItened as tKey rested on Ker son. He

believed it  all. How  patKetically  young  and pleased Ke looked.

How incredibly   niive  Ke was. No wonder  Ke got into  scrapes.

He was too trusting.  TKe trutK oI  it was Ke Kad too sweet a

nature. George didn't  tmderstand Kim  in tKe least. Men were

so unsympatKetic in  tKeir Mudgments. TKey Iorgot tKat tKey

Kad even been young tKemselves. George was mucK too KarsK

witK Reggie.

Mrs Macatta  Kad risen. GoodnigKts were  said.

TKe tKree women went out  oI tKe room. Lord  MayIield

Kelped KimselI to a drink  aIter  giving  one to Sir  George, tKen

Ke looked up as Mr  Carlile  appeared at tKe door.

'Get out tKe Iries and all  tKe papers, will  you,  Catlile?

Including  tKe plans and tKe prints. TKe Air  MarsKal  and I will

be along sKortly. We'll  Must take a turn outside Iirst, eK,

George? It's stopped raining.'

Mr Carlile,   turning  to depart, murmured  an apology  as Ke

almost collided  witK  Mrs  Vanderlyn.

24
SKe driIted towards tKem, murmuring:

'My book, I was reading it beIore dinner.'

Reggie sprang Ior'ward and Keld up a book.

'Is tKis it? On tKe soIa?'

'OK, yes. TKank You so mucK.'

SKe smiled sweetly, said goodnigKt again andwent out oI tKe

room.

Sir George Kad olaened one oI tKe IrencK windows.

'BeautiIul nigKt now,' Ke announced. 'Good idea oI yours to

take a turn.'

Reggie said:

'Well, goodnigKt, sir. I'll be toddling oII to bed.'

'GoodnigKt, my boy,' said Lord MayIield.

Reggie picked uD a detective story wKicK Ke Kad begun

earlier in tKe evening and leIt tKe room.

Lord MayIield anl Sir George stepped out upon tKe terrace.

14

 

25
It was a beautiIul nigKt, witK a clear sky studded witK stars.

Sir George drew a deep breatK.

'PKew, tKat woman uses a lot oI scent,' Ke remarked.

Lord MayIield laugKed.

'Anyway, it's not cKeap scent. One oI tKe most expensive

brands on tKe market, I sKould say.'

Sir George gave a grimace.

'I suppose one sKould be tKankIul Ior tKat.'

'You sKould, indeed. I tKink a woman smotKered in cKeap

scent is one oI tKe greatest abominations known to manldnd.'

Sir George glanced up at tKe sky.

'Extraordinary tKe way it's cleared. I Keard tKe rain beating

down wKen we were at dinner.'

TKe two men strolled gently along tKe terrace.

TKe terrace ran tKe wKole lengtK oI tKe Kouse. Below it tKe

ground sloped gently away, permitting a magniIicent view over

tKe Sussex weald.

Sir George lit a cigar.

'About tKis metal alloy -' Ke began.

TKe talk became tecKnical.

As tKey approacKed tKe Iar end oI tKe terrace Ior tKe IiItK

26
time, Lord MayIield said witK a sigK:

'OK, well, I suppose we'd better get down to it.'

'Yes, good bit oI work to get tKrougK.'

TKe two men turned, and Lord MayIield uttered a surprised

eMaculation.

'Hallo! See tKat?'

'See wKat?' asked Sir George.

'TKougKt I saw someone slip across tKe terrace Irom my

study window.'

'Nonsense, old boy. I didn't see anytKing.'

'Well, I did - or I tKougKt I did.'

'Your eyes are playing nicks on you. I was looking straigKt

down tKe terrace, and I'd Kave seen anytKing tKere was to be

seen. TKere's precious little I don't see - even iI I do Kave to

Kold a newspaper at arm's lengtK.'

Lord MayIield cKuckled.

15.

 

27
'I can put one over on you tKere, George. I read easily

witKout glasses.'

'But you can't always distinguisK tKe Iellow on tKe otKer side

oI tKe House. Or is tKat eyeglass oI yours sKeer intimidation?'

LaugKing, tKe two men entered Lord MayIield's study, tKe

IrencK window oI wKicK was open.

Mr Carlile was busy arranging some papers in a Iile by tKe

saIe.

He looked up as tKey entered.

'Ha, Carlile, everytKing ready?'

'Yes, Lord MayIield, all tKe papers are on your desk.'

TKe desk in question was a big important-looking wIiting-table

oI maKogany set across a corner by tKe window. Lord

MayIield went over to it, and began sorting tKrougK tKe various

documents laid out.

'Lovely nigKt now,' said Sir George.

Mr Carlile agreed.

'Yes, indeed. Remarkable tKe way it's cleared up aIter tKe

rain.'

Putting away Kis I'Ile, Mr Carlile asked:

'Will you want me any more tonigKt, Lord MayIield?'

28
'No, I don't tKink so, Carlile. I'll put all tKese away myselI.

We sKall probably be late. You'd better mm in.'

'TKank you. GoodnigKt, Lord MayIield. GoodnigKt, Sir

George.'

'GoodnigKt, Carlile.'

As tKe secretary was about to leave tKe room, Lord MayIield

said sKarply:

'Just a minute, Carlile. You've Iorgotten tKe most important

oI tKe lot.'

'I beg your pardon, Lord MayIield.'

'TKe actual plans oI tKe bomber, man.'

TKe secretary stared.

'TKey're IigKt on tKe top, sir.' 'TKey're notKing oI tKe sort.'

'But I've Must put tKem tKere.'

'Look Ior yourselI, man.'

16

 

29
WitK a bewildered expression, tKe young man came Iorward

and Moined Lord MayIield at tKe desk.

SomewKat impatiently tKe Minister indicated tKe pile oI

papers. Carlile sorted tKrougK tKem, Kis expression oI bewil-derment

growing.

'You see, tKey're not tKere.'

TKe secretary stammered:

'But - but it's incredible. I laid tKem tKere not tKree minutes

ago.'

Lord MayIield said good-Kumouredly:

'You must Kave made a mistake, tKey must be still in tKe

saIe.'

'I don't see Kow - I know I put tKem tKere?

Lord MayIield brusKed past Kim to tKe open saIe. Sir

George Moined tKem. A very Iew minutes suIIiced to sKow tKat

tKe plans oI tKe bomber were not tKere.

Dazed and unbelieving, tKe tKree men returned to tKe desk

and once more turned over tKe papers.

'My God!' said MayIield. 'TKey're gone!'

Mr Carlile cried:

'But it's impossible!'

30
'WKo's been in tKis room?'  snapped out tKe Minister.

'No one. No  one at all.'

'Look  Kere, Carlile, tKose plans Kaven't vanisKed into  tKin

air. Someone Kas taken tKem. Has Mrs Vanderlyn  been in

Kere?'

'Mrs Vanderlyn?  OK, no, sir.'

'I'll  back tKat,' said Carrington.  He  sniIIed  tKe air! 'You'd

soon smell iI  sKe Kad. TKat scent oI Kers.'

'Nobody  Kas been in Kere,' insisted Carlile.  'I can't under-stand

it.'

'Look  Kere, Carlile,' said  Lord MayIield.   'Pull  yourselI

togetKer. We've got to get to  tKe bottom oI  tKis. You're

absolutely sure tKe plans were  in tKe saIe?'

'Absolutely.'

'You actually  saw tKem? You didn't  Must assume tKey were

among tKe otKers?'

17

 

31
'No, no, Lord MayIield. I saw tKem. I put tKem on top oI tKe

otKers on tKe desk.'

'And since tKen, you say, nobody Kas been in tKe room. Have

you been out oI tKe room?'

'No - at least - yes.'

'AK!' cried Sir George. 'Now we're getting at it!'

Lord MayIield said sKarply:

'WKat on eartK -' wKen Carlile interrupted.

'In tKe normal course oI events, Lord MayIield, I sKould

not, oI course, Kave dreamt oI leaving tKe room wKen

important papers were lying about, but Kearing a woman

scream '

'A woman scream?' eMaculated Lord MayIield in a surprised

voice.

'Yes, Lord MayIield. It startled me more tKan I can say. I

was Must laying tKe papers on tKe desk wKen I Keard it, and

naturally I ran out into tKe Kall.'

'WKo screamed?'

'Mrs Vanderlyn's FrencK maid. SKe was standing KalIway

up tKe stairs, looking very wKite and upset and sKaking all over.

SKe said sKe Kad seen a gKost.'

32
'Seen a gKost?'

'Yes, a tall woman  dressed all in wKite  wKo moved  witKout

a sound and Iloated in  tKe air.'

'WKat a ridiculous  story!'

'Yes, Lord MayIield,   tKat is wKat I  told  Ker. I must say sKe

seemed ratKer asKamed oI KerselI. SKe went oII upstairs and I

came back in Kere.'

'How long  ago was tKis?'

'Just a minute or two  beIore  you and Sir George  came in.'

'And you  were out oI  tKe room - Kow  long?'

TKe secretary considered.

'Two minutes  - at tKe most tKree.'

'Long enougK,' groaned  Lord MayIield.   Suddenly  Ke

clutcKed Kis Iriend's  arm.

'George, tKat sKadow I saw - slinking   away Irom  tKis

18

 

33
window. TKat was it! As soon as Carlile leIt tKe room, Ke

nipped in, seized tKe plans and made oII.'

'Dirty work,' said Sir George.

TKen Ke seized Kis Iriend by tKe arm.

'Look Kere, CKarles, tKis is tKe devil oI a business. WKat tKe

Kell are we going to do about it?'

CHAPTER3

'At any rate give it a trial, CKarles.'

It was KalI an Kour later. TKe two men were in Lord

MayIield's study, and Sir George Kad been expending a

considerable amount oI persuasion to induce Kis Iriend to adopt

a certain course.

Lord MayIield, at Iirst  most unwilling, was gradually

becoming less averse to tKe idea.

Sir George went on:

'Don't be so damned pig-Keaded, CKarles.'

Lord MayIield said slowly:

'WKy drag in a wretcKed Ioreigner we know notKing about?'

'But I Kappen to know a lot about Kim. TKe man's a marvel.'

'HumpK.'

'Look Kere, CKarles. It's a cKance! Discretion is tKe essence

34
oI tKis business. II it leaks out '

'WKen it leaks out is wKat you mean!'

'Not necessarily. TKis man, Hercule Poirot '

'Will come down Kere and produce tKe plans like a conMurer

taking rabbits out oI Kis Kat, I suppose?'

'He'll get at tKe trutK. And tKe trutK is wKat we want. Look

Kere, CKarles, I take all responsibility on myselI.'

Lord MayIield said slowly:

'OK, well, Kave it your own way, but I don't see wKat tKe

Iellow can do...'

19

 

35
Sir George picked up tKe pKone.

'I'm going to get tKrougK to Kim - now.'

'He'll be in bed.'

'He can get up. DasK it all, CKarles, you can't let tKat woman

get away witK it.'

'Mrs Vandcrlyn, you mean?'

'Yes. You don't doubt, do you, tKat sKe's at tKe bottom oI

tKis?'

'No, I don't. SKe's turned tKe tables on me witK a vengeance.

I don't like admitting, George, tKat a woman's been too clever

Ior us. It goes against tKe grain. But it's true. We sKan't be able

to prove anytKing against Ker, and yet we botK know tKat sKe's

been tKe prime mover in tKe aIIair.'

'Women are tKe devil,' said Carrington witK Ieeling.

'NotKing to connect Ker witK it, damn it all! We may believe

tKat sKe put tKe girl up to tKat screaming trick, and tKat tKe man

lurking outside was Ker accomplice, but tKe devil oI it is we

can't prove it.'

'PerKaps Hercule Poirot can.'

Suddenly Lord MayIield laugKed.

'By tKe Lord, George, I tKougKt you were too mucK oI an old

36
JoKn Bull to  put your  trust in  a FrencKman, Kowever clever.'

'He's not even a FrencKman, Ke's a Belgian,'  said Sir George

in a ratKer sKameIaced manner.

'Well, Kave your  Belgian  down. Let  Kim try  Kis wits on  tKis

business. I'll  bet Ke can't make more oI  it tKan we can.'

WitKout replying,   Sir George stretcKed a Kand to tKe telepKone.

CHAPTER  4

Blinking  a little,   Hercule Poirot  turned  Kis Kead Irom one man

to tKe otKer. Very delicately  Ke smotKered a yawn.

20

 

37
It was KalI-past two in tKe morning. He Kad been roused

Irom sleep and rusKed down tKrougK tKe darkness in a big

Rolls Royce. Now Ke Kad Must I'misKed Kearing wKat tKe two

men Kad to tell Kim.

'TKose are tKe Iacts, M. Poirot,' said Lord MayIield.

He leaned back in Kis cKair, and slowly I'med Kis monocle in

one eye. TKrougK it a sKrewd, pale-blue eye watcKed Poirot

attentively. Besides being sKrewd tKe eye was deI'mitely

sceptical. Poirot cast a swiIt glance at Sir George Carrington.

TKat gentleman was leaning Iorward witK an expression oI

almost cKildlike KopeIulness on Kis Iace.

Poirot said slowly:

'I Kave tKe Iacts, yes. TKe maid screams, tKe secretary goes

out, tKe nameless watcKer comes in, tKe plans are tKere on top

oI tKe desk, Ke snatcKes tKem up and goes. TKe Iacts - tKey are

all very convenient.'

SometKing in tKe way Ke uttered tKe last pKrase seemed to

attract Lord MayIield's attention. He sat up a little straigKter,

Kis monocle dropped. It was as tKougK a new alertness came to

Kim.

'I beg your pardon, M. Poirot?'

38
'I said, Lord MayIield, tKat tKe Iacts were all very conve-nient

- Ior tKe tKieI. By tKe way, you are sure it was a man you

saw?'

Lord MayIield sKook Kis Kead.

'TKat I couldn't say. It was Must a - sKadow. In Iact, I was

almost doubtIul iI I Kad seen anyone.'

Poirot transIerred Kis gaze to tKe Air MarsKal.

'And you, Sir George? Could you say iI it was a man or a

woman?'

'I didn't see anyone myselI.'

Poirot nodded tKougKtIully. TKen Ke skipped suddenly to

Kis Ieet and went over to tKe writing-table.

'I can assure you tKat tKe plans are not tKere,' said Lord

MayIield. 'We Kave all tKree been tKrougK tKose papers KalI a

dozen times.'

'All tKree? You mean, your secretary also?'

21

 

39
'Yes, Carlile.'

Poirot turned suddenly.

'Tell me, Lord MayIield, wKicK paper was on top wKen you

went over to tKe desk?'

MayIield Irowned a little in  tKe eIIort oI remembrance.

'Let me see - yes, it was a rougK memorandum oI some sort

oI our air deIence positions.'

DeItly, Poirot nipped out a paper and brougKt it over.

'Is tKis tKe one, Lord MayIield?'

Lord MayIield took it  and glanced over it.

'Yes, tKat's tKe one.'

Poirot took it over to Carrington.

'Did you notice tKis paper on tKe desk?'

Sir George took it, Keld it away Irom Kim, tKen slipped on Kis

pincenez.

'Yes, tKat's rigKt. I looked tKrougK tKem too, witK Carlile

and MayIield. TKis was on top.'

Poirot nodded tKougKtIully. He replaced tKe paper on tKe

desk. MayIield looked at Kim in a sligKtly puzzled manner.

'II tKere are any otKer questions -' Ke began.

'But yes, certainly tKere is a question. Carlile. Carlile is tKe

40
question!'

Lord MayIield's colour rose a little.

'Carlile, M. Poirot, is quite above suspicion! He Kas been my

conIidential secretary Ior nine years. He Kas access to all my

private papers, and I may point out to you tKat Ke could Kave

made a copy oI tKe plans and a tracing oI tKe spedIications

quite easily witKout anyone being tKe wiser.'

'I appreciate your point,' said Poirot. 'II Ke Kad been guilty

tKere would be no need Ior Kim to stage a clumsy robbery.'

'In any case,' said Lord MayIield, 'I am sure oI Carlile. I will

guarantee Kim.'

'Carlile,' said Carrington gruIIly, 'is all rigKt.'

Poirot spread out Kis Kands graceIully.

'And tKis Mrs Vanderlyn - sKe is all wrong?'

'SKe's a wrong 'un all rigKt,' said Sir George.

Lord MayIield said in more measured tones:

22

 

41
'I tKink, M. Poirot, tKat tKere can be no doubt oI Mrs

Vanderlyn's - well - activities. TKe Foreign OIIice can give you

more precious data as to tKat.'

'And tKe maid, you take it, is in witK Ker mistress?'

'Not a doubt oI it,' said Sir George.

'It seems to me a plausible assumption,' said Lord MayIield

more cautiously.

TKere was a pause. Poirot sigKed, and absent-mindedly rearranged

one or two articles on a table at Kis rigKt Kand. TKen Ke said:

'I take it tKat tKese papers represented money? TKat is, tKe

stolen papers would be deIinitely wortK a large sum in casK.'

'II presented in a certain quarter - yes.'

'SucK as?'

Sir George mentioned tKe names oI two European powers.

Poirot nodded.

'TKat Iact would be known to anyone, I take it?'

'Mrs Vanderlyn would know it all rigKt.'

'I said to anyone?' 'I suppose so, yes.'

'Anyone witK a minimum oI intelligence would appreciate

tKe CasK value oI tKe plans?'

'Yes, but M. Poirot -' Lord MayIield was looking ratKer

42
uncomIortable.'

Poirot Keld up a Kand.

'I do wKat you  call explore  all  tKe avenues.'

Suddenly Ke rose again, stepped nimbly  out  oI tKe window

and witK a IlasKligKt  examined tKe edge oI tKe grass at tKe

IartKer side oI tKe terrace.

TKe two men watcKed Kim.

He came in again, sat down  and said:

'Tell me, Lord  MayIield,   tKis maleIactor,  tKis skulker  in tKe

sKadows, you do not Kave Kim pursued?'

Lord MayIield   sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'At tKe bottom  oI tKe garden Ke could make  Kis way out to  a

main road. II  Ke Kad a car waiting  tKere, Ke would soon be out

oI reacK '

23

 

43
'But tKere are tKe police - tKe A.A. scouts '

Sir George interrupted.

'You Iorget, M. Poirot. We cannot risk publicity. II it were to

get out tKat tKese plans Kad been stolen, tKe result would be

extremely unIavourable to tKe Party.'

'AK, yes,' said Poirot. 'One must remember La Politique. TKe great
discretion must be observed. You send instead Ior

me. AK well, perKaps it is simpler.'

'You are KopeIul oI success, M. Poirot?' Lord MayIield

sounded a triIle incredulous.

TKe little man sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'WKy not? One Kas only to reason - to reIlect.'

He paused a moment and tKen said:

'I would like now to speak to Mr Carlile.'

'Certainly.' Lord MayIield rose. 'I asked Kim to wait up. He

will be somewKere at Kand.'

He went out oI tKe room.

Poirot looked at Sir George.

'EK bien,' Ke said. 'WKat about tKis man on tKe terrace?'

'My dear M. Poirot. Don't ask me! I didn't see Kim, and I

can't describe Kim.'

Poirot leaned Iorward.

44
'So you Kave already said. But it is a little diIIerent Irom tKat

is it not?'

'wKat d'you mean?' asked Sir George abruptly.

'How sKall I say it? Your disbelieI, it is more proIomaxt.'

Sir George started to speak, tKen stopped.

'But yes,' said Poirot encouragingly. 'Tell me. You are botK

at tKe end oI tKe terrace. Lord MayIield sees a sKadow slip Irom

tKe window and across tKe grass. WKy do you not see tKat

sKadow?'

Carrington stared at Kim.

'You've Kit it, M. Poirot. I've been worrying about tKat ever

since. You see, I'd swear tKat no one did leave tKis window. I

tKougK MayIield Kad imagined it - brancK oI a tree waving sometKing

oI tKat kind. And tKen wKen we came in Kere and

24

 

45
Iound tKere Kad been a robbery, it seemed as tKougK MayIield

must Kave been rigKt and I'd been wrong. And yet -'

Poirot smiled.

'And yet you still in your Keart oI Kearts believe in tKe

evidence (tKe negative evidence) oI your own eyes?'

'You're rigKt, M. Poirot, I do.'

Poirot gave a sudden smile.

'How wise you are.'

Sir George said sKarply:

'TKere were no Iootprints on tKe grass edge?'

Poirot nodded.

'Exactly. Lord MayIield, Ke Iancies Ke sees a sKadow. TKen

tKere comes tKe robbery and Ke is sure - but sure! It is no

longer a Iancy - Ke actually saw tKe man. But tKat is not so. Me,

I do not concern myselI mucK witK Iootprints and sucK tKings

but Ior wKat it is wortK we Kave tKat negative evidence. TKere

were no Iootprints on tKe grass. It Kad rained Keavily tKis

evening. II a man Kad crossed tKe terrace to tKe grass tKis

evening Kis Iootprints would Kave sKown.'

Sir George said, staring: 'But tKen - but tKen '

'It brings us back to tKe Kouse. To tKe people in tKe Kouse.'

46
He broke oII as tKe door opened and Lord Maytield entered

witK Mr Carlile.

TKougK still looking very pale and worried, tKe secretary Kad

regained a certain composure oI manner. AdMusting Kis pincenez

Ke sat down and looked at Poirot inquiringly.

'How long Kad you been in tKis room wKen you Keard tKe

scream, monsieur?'

Carlile considered.

'Between Iive and' ten minutes, I sKould say.'

'And beIore tKat tKere Kad been no disturbance oI any kind?'

'No.'

'I understand tKat tKe Kouse-party Kad been in one room Ior

tKe greater part oI tKe evening.'

'Yes, tKe drawing-room.'

Poirot consulted Kis notebook.

'Sir George Carrington and Kis wiIe. Mrs Macatta. Mrs

25

 

47
Vandedyn. Mr Reggie Carrington. Lord MayIield and your-selI.

Is tKat rigKt?'

'I myselI was not in tKe drawing-room. I was working Kere

tKe greater part oI tKe evening.'

Poirot turned to Lord MayIield.

'WKo went up to bed Iirst?'

'Lady Julia Carrington, I tKink. As a matter oI Iact, tKe tKree

ladies went out togetKer.'

'And tKen?'

'Mr Carlile came in and I told Kim to get out tKe papers as

Sir George and I would be along in a minute.'

'It was tKen tKat you decided to take a turn on tKe terrace?'

'It was.'

'Was anytKing said in Mrs Vanderlyn's Kearing as to your

working in tKe study?'

'TKe matter was mentioned, yes.'

'But sKe was not in tKe room wKen you irtstnacted Mr Carlile

to get out tKe papers?'

'No.'

'Excuse me, Lord MayIield,' said Carlile. 'Just aIter you Kad

said tKat, I collided witK Ker in tKe doorway. SKe Kad come

48
back Ior a book.'

'So you tKink sKe migKt Kave overKeard?'

'I tKink it quite possible, yes.'

'SKe came back Ior a book,' mused Poirot, 'IDid you Ired Ker

Ker book, Lord MayIield?'

'Yes, Reggie gave it to Ker.'

'AK, yes, it is wKat you call tKe old gasp - no,, pardon, tKe old

wKeeze - tKat - to come back Ior a book. It is; oIten useIul!'

'You tKink it was deliberate?'

Poirot sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'And aIter tKat, you two gentlemen [go outr on tKe terrace.

And Mrs Vandedyn?'

'SKe went oII witK Ker book.'

'And tKe young M. Reggie. He went to bectt also?'

'Yes.'

'And Mr Carlile Ke comes Kere and smraetirme between Iive

26

 

49
and ten minutes later Ke Keard a scream. Continue, M. Carlile.

you Keard a scream and you went out into tKe Kall. AK, perKaps

it would be simplest iI you reproduced exactly your actions.'

Mr Carlile got up a little awkwardly.

'Here I scream,' said Poirot KelpIully. He opened Kis moutK

and emitted a sKrill bleat. Lord MayIield turn Kis Kead away to

Kide a smile and Mr Carlile looked extremely uncomIortable.

'Allez! Forward! MarcK!' cried Poirot. 'It is your cue tKat I

give you tKere.'

Mr Carlile walked stiIIly  to tKe door, opened it and went out.

Poirot Iollowed Kim. TKe otKer two came beKind.

'TKe door, did you close it aIter you or leave it open?'

'I can't really remember. I tKink I must Kave leIt it open.'

'No matter. Proceed.'

Still witK extreme stiIIness, ,Mr Carlile walked to tKe bottom

oI tKe staircase and stood tKere looking up.

Poirot said:

'TKe maid, you say, was on tKe stairs. WKereabouts?'

'About KalI-way up.'

'And sKe,was looking upset.'

'DeIinitely so.'

50
'EK bien, me, I am tKe maid.' Poirot ran nimbly up tKe stairs.

'About Kere?'

'A step or two KigKer.'

'Like tKis?'

Poirot struck an attitude.

'Well - er - not quite like tKat.'

'How tKen?'

'Well, sKe Kad Ker Kands to Ker Kead.'

'AK, Ker Kands to Ker lead. TKat is very interesting. Like

tKis?' Poirot raised Kis arms, Kis Kands rested on Kis Kead Must

above eacK ear.

'Yes tKat's it.'

'AKa! And tell me, M. Carlile, sKe was a pretty girl - yes?'

'Really, I didn't notice.'

Carlile's voice was repressive.

 

51
'AKa, you did not notice? But you are a young man. Does not

a young man notice wKen a girl is pretty?'

'Really, M. Poirot, I can only repeat tKat I did not do so.)

Carlile cast an agonized glance at Kis employer. Sir Georg

Carrington gave a sudden cKuckle.

'M. Poirot seems determined to make you out a gay dog

Carlile,' Ke remarked.

TKe, I always notice wKen a girl is pretty,' announced Poiro

as Ke descended tKe stairs.

TKe silence witK wKicK Mr Carlile greeted tKis remark wa,

somewKat pointed. Poirot went on:

'And it was tKen sKe told tKis tale oI Kaving seen a gKost?'

'Yes.'

'Did you believe tKe story?'

'Well, Kardly, M. Poirot?

'I do not mean, do you believe in gKosts. I mean, did it strike

you tKat tKe girl KerselI really tKougKt sKe Kad seen

sometKing?'

'OK, as to tKat, I couldn't say. SKe was certainly breatKing

Iast and seemed upset.'

'You did not see or Kear anytKing oI Ker mistress?'

52
'Yes, as a matter oI Iact I did. SKe came out oI Ker room in

tKe gallery above and called, "Leonie."'

'And tKen?'

'TKe girl ran up to Ker and I went back to tKe study.'

'WKilst you were standing at tKe Ioot oI tile stairs Kere, could

anyone Kave entered tKe study by tKe door you Kad leIt open?'

Carlile sKook Kis Kead.

'Not witKout passing me. TKe study door is at tKe end oI tKe

passage, as you see.'

Poirot nodded tKougKtIully. Mr Carlile went on in Kis

careIul, precise voice.

'I may say tKat I am very tKankIul tKat Lorel MayIield

actually saw tKe tKieI leaving tKe window. OtKerwise I myselI

sKould be in a very unpleasant position.'

'Nonsense, my dear Carlile,' broke in Lord MayIield

impatiently. 'No suspicion could possibly attacK to you.'

28

 

53
'It is very kind oI you to say so, Lord MayIield, but Iacts are

Iacts, and I can quite see tKat it looks badly Ior me. In any case

I Kope tKat my belongings and myselI may be searcKed.'

'Nonsense, my dear Iellow,' said MayIield.

Poirot murmured:

'You are serious in wisKing tKat?'

'I sKould inIinitely preIer it.'

Poirot looked at Kim tKougKtIully Ior a minute or two and

murmured, 'I see.'

TKen Ke asked:

'WKere is Mrs Vandedyn's room situated in regard to tKe

study?'

'It is directly over it.'

'WitK a window looking out over tKe terrace?'

'Yes.'

Again Poirot nodded. TKen Ke said:

'Let us go to tKe drawing-room.'

Here Ke wandered round tKe room, examined tKe Iastenings

oI tKe windows, glanced at tKe scorers on tKe bridge table and

tKen Iinally addressed Lord MayIield.

'TKis aIIair,' Ke said, 'is more complicated tKan it appears.

54
But one tKing is quite certain. TKe stolen plans Kave not leIt

tKis Kouse.'

Lord MayIield stared at Kim.

'But, my dear M. Poirot, tKe man I saw leaving tKe study-'

TKere was no man.

'But I saw Kim -'

q WitK tKe greatest respect, Lord MyIield, you imagined

iou saw Kim. TKe sKadow cast by tKe brancK oI a tree deceived

you. TKe Iact tKat a robbery occurred naturally seemed a prooI

tKat wKat you Kad imagined was true.'

'Really, M. Poirot, tKe evidence oI my own eyes '

'Back my eyes against yours any day, old boy,' put in Sir

i

orge.

::(! You must permit me, Lord MayIield, to be very deIinite on

,;,-t point. No one crossed tKe terrace to tKe grass.

: Looking very pale and speaking stiIIly, Mr Carlile said:

29

 

55
'In tKat case, iI M. Poirot is correct, suspicion autoz 'i, 41y

attacKes itselI to me. I am tKe only person wKo could

Kave committed tKe robbery.'

' tly

Lord MayIield sprang up.

'Nonsense. WKatever M. Poirot tKinks about it, I don't

agree witK Kim. I am convinced oI your innocence, r%, ,tear

Carlile. In Iact, I'm willing  to guarantee it.'

Poirot murmured mildly:

'But I Kave not said tKat I suspect M. Carlile.'

Carlile answered:

'No, but you've made it perIectly clear tKat no one else Kad

a cKance to commit tKe robbery.'

'Du tout[ Du tout['

'But I Kave told you nobody passed me in tKe Kall to get to

tKe study door.'

'I agree. But someone migKt Kave come in tKrougK tKe study

window.'

'But tKat is Must wKat you said did not Kappen?'

'I said tKat no one Irom outside could Kave come and leIt

witKout leaving marks on tKe grass. But it could Kave been

56
managed Irom inside  tKe Kouse. Someone could Kave gone

Irom Kis room  by one oI  tKese windows, slipped  along  tKe

terrace, in at tKe study window,   and back again in  Kere.'

Mr Carlile   obMected:

'But Lord  MayIield   and Sir George  Carriugton  were on

terrace.'

'TKey were on tKe terrace, yes, but tKey were  en promenade:,

Sir George Carrington's  eyes may be oI  tKe most reliable'

Poirot made a little  bow  - 'but  Ke does not keep tKem in tKe

back oI Kis Kead! TKe study window   is at tKe extreme leIt  oI tbs:

terrace, tKe windows  oI tKis room  come next, but  tKe terrace

continues to tKe rigKt past one, two,  tKree, perKaps Ioul'

rooms?'

'Dining-room,   billiard-room,   morning  room  and library,'

said Lord  MayIield.

',And you  walked  up and down  tKe terrace, Kow many times?'

At least Iive  or  sin.

30

'You see, it ia easy enougK, tKe tKieI Kas only to  watcK Ior tKe

rigKt moment!'

Carlile  said slowly:

'You mean tKat wKen I was in  tKe Kall, talking  to tKe FrencK

57
girl, tKe tKieI was waiting in tKe drawing-room?'

'TKat is my suggestion. It is, oI course, only a suggestion.'

'It doesn't sound very probable to me,' said Lord MayIield.

'Too risky.'

TKe Air MarsKall demurred.

'I don't agree witK you, CKarles. It's perIectly possible.

Wonder I Kadn't tKe wits to tKink oI it Ior myselI.'

'So you see,' said Poirot, 'wKy I believe tKat tKe plans are still

in tKe Kouse. TKe problem now is to Ired tKem?

Sir George snorted.

'TKat's simple enougK. SearcK everybody.'

Lord MayIield made a movement oI dissent, but Poirot

spoke beIore Ke could.

'No, no, it is not so simple as tKat. TKe person wKo took

tKose plans will anticipate tKat a searcK will be made and will

make quite sure tKat tKey are not Iound amongst Kis or Ker

belongings. TKey will Kave been Kidden in neutral ground.'

'Do you suggest tKat we've got to go playing Kide and seek all

over tKe bally Kouse?'

Poirot smiled.

'No, no, we need not be so crude as tKat. We can arrive at tKe

Kiding-place (or alternatively at tKe identiIy oI tKe guilty

58
person) by reIlection. TKat will simpliIy matters. In tKe

morning I would like an interview witK every person in tKe

Kouse. It would, I tKink, be unwise to seek tKose interviews

now.'

Lord MayIield nodded.

'Cause too mucK comment,' Ke said, 'iI we dragged everybody

out oI tKeir beds at tKree in tKe morning. In any case you'll

Kave to proceed witK a good deal oI camouIlage, M. Poirot.

TKis matter Kas got to be kept dark.'

Poirot waved an airy Kand.

'Leave it to Hercule Poirot. TKe lies I invent are always most

He and tKe secretary went out, sKutting tKe door beKind

Sir George sat down, reacKing mecKanically Ior a cigarette.

He turned a puzzled Iace to Poirot.

'You knoN,, Ke said slowly. 'I don't quite get tKis.'

'TKat is V%y simply explained,' said Poirot witK a smile.

'OK,' said Carrington. 'I tKink I see. Mrs Vanderlyn?'

'Precisely, It migKt be, you see, tKat it would not be ver'

Ior tKe lady (Mad tKat is wKy I seek to talk to you alone. I do not

wisK to embtrrass Kim). Two, tKat Mrs Vanderlyn is perKaps

tKe dear Iriend oI someone else in tKe Kouse?'

'You can %unt me out!' said Sir George witK a grin.

'TKen, iI reitKer oI tKose cases is true, tKe question returns

in redoubled l?orce. WKy Mrs Vanderlyn? And it seems to me I

perceive a sK.dowy answer. TKere was a reason. Her presence

at tKis parttular Muncture was deIinitely desired by Lord

MayIield Ior a special reason. Am I rigKt?'

Sir Georg nodded.

IoYou're quite rigKt,' Ke said. 'MayIield is too old a bird to

r Ker wiles. He wanted Ker Kere Ior quite anotKer reason. It

was like tKis.

He retaileq tKe conversation tKat Kad taken place at tKe

dinner-table. Poirot listened attentively.

32

 

61
'AK,' Ke said. 'I compreKend now.  NevertKeless, it seems

tKat tKe lady Kas turned tKe tables on you botK ratKer neatly?

Sir George swore  Ireely.

Poirot watcKed Kim  witK some sligKt  amusement, tKen Ke

said:

'You do not doubt  tKat tKis tKeIt is Ker doing  - I mean, tKat

sKe is responsible Ior it,  wKetKer or no sKe played an active

part?'

Sir George stared.

'OI course not!  TKere isn't any  doubt oI  tKat. WKy, wKo else

would  Kave any interest in stealing  tKose plans?'

'AK!' said Hercule  Poirot.  He leaned back  and looked at tKe

ceiling.  'And  yet, Sir George,  we agreed, not a quarter oI  an

Kour ago, tKat tKese papers represented very deIinitely  money.

Not perKaps, in quite  so obvious a Iorm  as banknotes, or  gold,

or Mewellery, but nevertKeless tKey were potential money.  II

tKere were anyone Kere wKo was Kard up '

TKe otKer 'interrupted Kim  witK a snort.

'WKo isn't tKese days? I suppose I can say it  witKout

incriminating   myselI.'

He smiled and  Poirot smiled  poIitely   back at Kim and

62
murmured:

'Mais oui, you can say wKat you like, Ior you, Sir George,

Kave tKe one unimpeacKable alibi in tKis aIIair.'

'But I'm danmed Kard up myselIl.'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead sadly.

'Yes, indeed, a man in your position Kas Keavy living

expenses. TKen you Kave a young son at a most expensive age '

Sir George groaned.

'Education's bad enougK, tKen debts on top oI it. Mind you,

tKis lad's not a bad lad.'

Poirot listened sympatKetically. He Keard a lot oI tKe Air

MarsKal's accumulated grievances. TKe lack oI grit and

stamina in tKe younger generation, tKe Iantastic way in wKicK

motKers spoilt tKeir cKildren and always took tKeir side, tKe

curse oI gambling once it got Kold oI a woman, tKe Iolly oI

playing Ior KigKer stakes tKan you could aIIord. It was coucKed

33

 

63
in general terms, Sir George did not allude directly to eitKer Kis

wiIe or Kis son, but Kis natural transparency made Kis

generalizations very easy to see tKrougK.

He broke oII suddenly.

'Sorry, mustn't take up your time witK sometKing tKat's

rigKt oII tKe subMect, especially at tKis Kour oI tKe nigKt - or

ratKer, morning.'

He stiIled a yawn.

'I suggest, Sir George, tKat you sKould go to bed. You Kave

been most kind and KelpIul.'

'RigKt, tKink I will mm in. You really tKink tKere is a cKance

oI gettirsg tKe plans back?'

Poirot sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'I mean to try. I do not see wKy not.'

'Well, I'll be oII. GoodigKt.'

He leIt tKe room.

Poirot remained in Kis cKair staring tKougKtIully at tKe

ce'Iling, tKen Ke took out a LITTLE notebook and turning to a clean

page, Ke wrote:

Mrs Vanderlyn?

Lady Julia CarIington?

64
/vlrs Macatta?

Reggie Carrington?

Mr Carlile?

UnderneatK Ke wrote:

Mrs

Vanderlyn and Mr Reggie Carrington?

Mrs

VandeIiyn and Lady Julia?

Mrs

Vanderlyn and Mr Carlile?

He sKcok Kis Kead in a dissatisIied manner, murmuring:

'C'est Mus simple que Ia.'

TKen Ke added a Iew sKort sentences.

Did Lord MayIield  see a 'sKadow'? II not, wKy did Ke say Ke

34

 

65
did? Did Sir George see anytKing? He was positive Ke Kad seez

notKing AFTER I examined Ilower-bed. Note: Lord MayIield

near-sigKted can read witKout glasses but Kas to use a monocle tt

look across a room. Sir George is long-sigKted. TKereIore, Irom

Iar end oI tKe terrace, Kis sigKt is more to be depended upon tKaz,

::Lord MayIield'  s. Yet Lord MayIield is very positive tKat Ke DID

il see sometKing and is quite unsKaken by Kis Iriend's denial.

: i, Can anyone be quite as above suspicion as Mr Carlile appears tt

be? Lord MayIield is very empKatic as to Kis innocence. Too muci.

so. lYKy? Because Ke secretly suspects ban and is asKamed oI K

suspicions? Or because Ke deIinitely suspects some otKer person.;

is to say, some person OTHER tKan Mrs Vanderlyn?

He put tKe notebook away.

TKen, getting up, Ke were along to tKe study.

CHAPTER5

Lord MayIield was seated at Kis desk wKen Poirot entered tKe

study. He swung round, laid down Kis pen, and looked up

inquiringly.

'Well, M. Poirot, Kad your interview witK Carrington?'

Poirot smiled and sat down.

'Yes, Lord MayIield. He cleared up a point tKat Kad puzzled

66
'WKat was tKat?'

'TKe reason Ior Mrs Vanderlyn's presence Kere. You

compreKend, I tKougKt it possible -'

MayIield was quick to realize tKe cause oI Poirot's somewKat

exaggerated embarrassment.

'You tKougKt I Kad a weakness Ior tKe lady? Not at all. Far

Irom it. Funnily enougK, Carrington tKougKt tKe same.'

35

 

67
'Yes, Ke Kas told me oI tKe conversation Ke Keld witK x,[

tKe subMect.'

- '

Lord MayIield looked ratKer rueIul.

cM ·

y little scKeme didn't come oII. Always annoying t I

to admit tKat a Woman Kas got tKe better oI you. '

'AK, but sKe Kas not got tKe better oI you yet, MayIield.'

·

ou tKink we may yet win? Well, I'm glad to Kear you

so. I'd like to tKink it was true.'

He sigKed.

'I Ieel I've acted like a complete Iool - so pleased witK my

stratagem Ior entrapping tKe lady.'

Hercule Poirot said, as Ke lit one oI Kis tiny cigarettes:

'WKat was your stratagem exactly, Lord Ma3rIield?'

'Well,' Lord MayIield  Kesitated. 'I Kadn't exactly got down

to details.'

'You didn't discuss it witK anyone?'

'No.'

'Not even witK Mr Carlile?'

68
'No.'

Poirot smiled.

'You preIer to play a lone Kand, Lord MayIield.'

'I-Kave usually Iound it tKe best way,' said tKe otKer a little

grimly.

'Yes, you are wise. Trust no one. But you d/mention tKe

matter to Sir George Carrinon'

'Si ' '

- --°- °

reply tecause I realized tKat tKe dear Iellow was seriously

perturbed about nae.'

Lord MayIield smiled at tKe remembrance.

'He is an old Iriend oI yours?'

'Yes. I Kave known Kim Ior over twenty years.'

'And Kis wiIe?'

'I Kave known Kis wiIe also, oI course.'

'But (pardon me iI I am impertinent) you are not on tKe same

terms oI intimacy witK Ker?'

'I don't really see wKeat my personal relationsKips to people

Kas to do witK tKe matter in Kand, M. Poirot.'

36

 

69
'But I tKink, Lord MayIield,  tKat tKey may Kave a good deal

to do witK it. You agreed, did you not, tKat my tKeory oI

someone in tKe drawing-room was a possible one?'

'Yes. In Iact, I agree witK you tKat tKat is wKat must Kave

Kappened.'

'We will not say "must." TKat is too selI-conIident a word.

But iI tKat tKeory oI mine is true, wKo do you tKink tKe person

in tKe drawing-room could Kave been?'

. 'Obviously Mrs Vanderlyn. SKe Kad been back tKere once

Ior a book. SKe could Kave come back Ior anotKer book, or a

Kandbag, or a dropped KandkercKieI- one oI a dozen Ieminine

excuses. SKe arranges witK Ker maid to scream and get Carlile

away Irom tKe study. TKen sKe slips in and out by tKe windows

as you said.'

'You Iorget it could not Kave been Mrs Vanderlyn. Carlile

Keard Ker call tKe maid Irom upstairs wKile Ke was talking to tKe

girl.'

Lord MayIield bit  Kis lip.

'True. I Iorgot tKat.' He looked tKorougKly annoyed.

'You see,' said Poirot gently. 'We progress. We Kave Iirst tKe

simple explanation oI a tKieI wKo comes Irom outs/de and

70
makes oII witK tKe booty. A very convenient tKeory as I said at

tKe time, too convenient to be readily accepted. We Kave

disposed oI tKat. TKen we come to tKe tKeory oI tKe Ioreign

agent, Mrs Vanderlyn, and tKat again seems to Iit togetKer

beautiIully up to a certain point. But now it looks as tKougK

tKat, too, was too easy - too convenient - to be accepted.'

'You'd wasK Mrs Vanderlyn out oI it altogetKer?'

'It was not Mrs Vanderlyn in tKe drawing-room. It may Kave

been an ally oI Mrs Vanderlyn's wKo committed tKe tKeIt, but

it is Must possible tKat it was committed by anotKer person

altogetKer. II so, we Kave to consider tKe question oI motive.'

'Isn't tKis ratKer Iar-IetcKed, M. Po[rot?'

'I do not tKink so. Now wKat motives could tKere be? TKere

is tKe motive oI money. TKe papers may Kave been stolen witK

tKe obMect oI turning tKem into casK. TKat is tKe simplest

37

 

71
motive to consider. But tKe motive migKt possibly be sometKing

quite diIIerent.'

'SucK as -'

Poirot said slowly:

'It migKt Kave been done deIinitely witK tKe idea or

damaging someone.'

'WKo.>'

'Possibly Mr Carlile. He would be tKe obvious suspect. Bm

tKere migKt be more to it tKan tKat. TKe men wKo control tKe

destiny oI a country, Lord MayIield, are particularly vulnera-.

Kie to displays oI popular Ieeling.'

'Meaning tKat tKe tKeIt was aimed at damaging me?'

Poirot nodded.

'I tKink I am correct in saying, Lord MayIield, tKat about

Iive years ago you passed tKrougK a somewKat trying time. You

were suspected oI IriendsKip witK a European Power at tKat

time bitterly unpopular witK tKe electorate oI tKis country.'

'Quite true, M. Poirot.'

'A statesman in tKese days Kas a diIIicult task. He Kas to

pursue tKe policy Ke deems advantageous to Kis country, but Ke

Kas at tKe same time to recognize tKe Iorce oI popular Ieeling.

72
Popular Ieeling is very oIten sentimental, muddle-Keaded, and

eminently unsound, but it cannot be disregarded Ior all tKat.'

'How well you express it! TKat is exactly tKe curse oI a

politician's liIe He Kas to bow to tKe country's Ieeling, Kowever

dangerous and IoolKardy Ke knows it to be.'

'TKat was your dilemma, I tKink. TKere were rumours tKat

you Kad concluded an agreement witK tKe country in question.

TKis country and tKe newspapers were up in arms about it.

Fortunately tKe Prime Minister was able categorically to deny

tKe story, and you repudiated it, tKougK s611 making no secret

oI tKe way your sympatKies lay.'

'All tKis is quite tree, M. Poirot, but wKy rake up past

Kistory?'

'Because I consider it possible tKat an enemy, disappointed

in tKe way you surmounted tKat crisis, migKt endeavour to

stage a IurtKer dilemma. You soon regained public conIidence.

38

 

73
TKose particular circumstances Kave passed away, you

now, deservedly, one oI tKe most popular Iigures in politica

liIe. You are spoken oI Ireely as tKe next Prime Minister wKe

Mr Hunberly retires.'

'You tKink tKis is an attempt to discredit me? Nonsense!' 'Tout de mme,
Lord MayIield, it  would not look well iI  i

were known tKat tKe plans oI Britain's new bomber Kad beet

stolen during a weekend wKen a certain very cKarming lady Ka¢

been your guest. Little Kints in tKe newspapers as to you

relationsKip witK tKat lady would create a Ieeling oI distrust ix you.'

'SucK a tKing could not really be taken seriously.'

'My dear Lord MayIield, you know perIectly well  it could!

It takes so little to undermine public conIidence in a man.'

'Yes, tKat's true,' said Lord MayIield. He looked suddenlM

very worried. 'God! Kow desperately complicated tKis busines:

is becoming. Do you really tKink - but it's impossible impossible.'

'You know oI nobody wKo is - iealous oI you?'

'Absurd!'

'At any rate you will admit tKat my questions about yotn

personal relationsKips witK tKe members oI tKis Kouse-part

are not totally irrelevant.'

'OK, perKaps - perKaps. You asked me about Julia Carting-ton.

74
TKere's really not very mucK to say. I've never taken to Ke

very mucK, and I don't tKink sKe cares Ior me. SKe's one oI

tKese restless, nervy women, recklessly extravagant and mad

about cards. SKe's old-IasKioned enougK, I tKink, to despise

me as being a selI-made man.'

Poirot said:

'I looked you up in WKo's WKo beIore I came down. You

were tKe Kead oI a Iamous engineering Iirm and you are

yourselI a Iirst-class engineer.'

'TKere's certainly notKing I don't know about tKe practical

side. I've worked my way up Irom tKe bottom.'

Lord MayIield spoke ratKer grimly.

'OK la la!' cried Poirot. 'I Kave been a Iool - but a Iool!'

4O

 

79
between Lord MayIield and Hercule Poirot, Kad a Ieeling tKa

Ke was not managing it as well as Ke migKt Kave done.

'To send Ior a queer Ioreigner like tKis seems very odd tl

me,' said Reggie. 'WKat Kas been taken, FatKer?'

'I don't know exactly, my boy.'

Reggie got up. He looked ratKer nervy and on edge tKis

morlling.

'NotKing - important? No - papers or anytKing like tKat?'

'To tell you tKe trutK, Reggie, I can't tell you exactly.'

'Very KusK-KusK, is it? I see.'

Reggie ran up tKe stairs, paused Ior a moment KaIt-way witK

a Irown on Kis Iace, and tKen continued Kis ascent ami tapped

on Kis motKer's door. Her voice bade Kim enter.

Lady Julia was sitting up in bed, scribbling Iigures on tKe

back oI an envelope.

'Good morning, darling.' SKe looked up, tKen said sKarply:

'Reggie, is anytKing tKe matter?'

'NotKing mucK, but it seems tKere was a burglary last nigKt.'

'A burglary? WKat was taken?'

'OK, I don't know. It's all very KusK KusK. TKere's some odd

kind oI private-inquiry agent downstairs asking everybody

80
questions.'

'How extraordinary?

'It's ratKer unpleasant,' said Reggie slowly, 'staying in a

Kouse wKen tKat kind oI tKing Kappens.'

'WKat did Kappen exactly?'

'Don't know. It was some time aIter we all went to bed. Look

out, MotKer, you'll Kave tKat tray oII.'

He rescued tKe breakIast-tray and carried it to a table by tKe

window.

'Was money taken?'

'I tell you I don't know.'

Lady Julia said slowly:

'I suppose tKis inquiry man is asking everybody questions?'

'I suppose so.'

'WKere tKey were last nigKt? All tKat kind oI tKing?'

41

 

81
'Probably. Well, I can't tell Kim mucK. I went straigKt up to

bed and was asleep in next to no time.'

Lady Julia did not answer.

'I say, MotKer, I suppose you couldn't let me Kave a spot oI

casK. I'm absolutely broke.'

'No, I couldn't,' Kis motKer replied decisively. 'I've got tKe

most IrigKtIul overdraIt myselI. I don't know wKat your IatKer

will say wKen Ke Kears about it.'

TKere was a tap at tKe door and Sir George entered.

'AK, tKere you are, Reggie. Will you go down to tKe library?

M. Hercule Poirot wants to see you.'

Poirot Kad Must concluded an interview witK tKe redoubtable

Mrs Macatta.

A Iew brieI questions Kad elicited tKe inIormation tKat Mm

Macatta Kad gone up to bed Must beIore eleven, and Kad Keard

or seen notKing KelpIul.

Poirot slid gently Irom tKe topic oI tKe burglary to more

personal matters. He KimselI Kad a great admiration Ior Lord

MayIield. As a member oI tKe general public Ke Ielt tKat Lord

MayIield was a truly great man. OI course, Mrs Macatta, being

in tKe know, would Kave a Iar better means oI estimating tKat

82
tKan KimselI.

'Lord MayIield Kas brains,' allowed Mrs Macatta. 'And Ke

Kas carved Kis career out entirely Ior KimselI. He owes notKing

to Kereditary inIluence. He Kas a certain lack oI vision, perKaps.

In tKat I Iind all men sadly alike. TKey lack tKe breadtK oI a

woman's imagination. Woman, M. Poirot, is going to be tKe

great Iorce in government in ten years' time.'

Poirot said tKat Ke was sure oI it.

He slid to tKe topic oI Mrs Vanderlyn. Was it true, as Ke Kad

Keard Kinted, tKat sKe and Lord MayIield were very dose

Iriends?

'Not in tKe least. To tell you tKe trutK I was very surprised

to meet Ker Kere. Very surprised indeed.'

Poirot invited Mrs Macatta's opinion oI Mrs Vanderlyn and got it.

'One oI tKose absolutely useless women, M. Poirot. Women

42

 

83
tKat make one despair oI one's own  sex! A  parasite, Iirst  and last

a parasite.'

TKen admired Ker?'

TKen? Mrs Macatta  spoke tKe word witK  contempt.  TKen

are always taken in  by tKose very Obvious  good  looks. TKat boy,

now, young Reggie  Carrington,  IlusKing  up every  time sKe

spoke to Kim, absurdly  Ilattered  by being  taken notice oI  by

Ker. And tKe silly  way sKe Ilattered  Kim too. Praising  Kis bridge

- wKicK actually  was Iar Irom  brilliant.'

'He is not a good  player?'

'He made all sorts  oI mistakes last  nigKt.'

'Lady Julia  is a good player,  is sKe not?'

'MucK too good  in my  opinion,'  said Mrs  Macatta.  'It's

almost a proIession  witK Ker. SKe plays morning,  noon, and

nigKt.'

'For KigK stakes?'

'Yes, indeed, mucK KigKer tKan I would  care to play.  Indeed

I sKouldn't consider  it rigKt.'

'SKe makes a good deal oI money at tKe game?'

Mrs.Macatta  gave a loud and virtuous  snort.

'SKe reckons on paying Ker debts tKat way. But  sKe's been

84
Kaving a run oI  bad luck lately,  so I've  Keard. SKe looked last

nigKt as tKougK sKe Kad sometKing on Ker mind. TKe evils oI

gambling,  M. Po[rot,  are only  sligKtly  less tKan tKe evils caused

by drink.  II  I Kad my way  tKis country  sKould be puriIied  -'

Poirot was Iorced  to listen  to a somewKat lengtKy  discussion

on tKe puriIication  oI  England's morals.  TKen Ke closed tKe

conversation adroitly   and sent Ior Reggie  Carrington.

He summed tKe young man  up careIully  as Ke entered tKe

room, tKe weak moutK camouIlaged  by  tKe ratKer cKarming

smile, tKe indecisive  cKin, tKe eyes set Iar apart, tKe ratKer

narrow Kead. He tKougKt tKat Ke knew Reggie Carrington's

type Iairly  well.

'Mr Reggie  Carrington?'

'Yes. AnytKing  I can do?'

'Just tell me wKat you  can about last nigKt?'

43

 

85
'Well, let me see, we played bridge - in tKe drawing-room.

AIter tKat I went up to bed.'

'TKat was at wKat time?'

'Just beIore eleven. I suppose tKe robbery took place aIter

tKat?'

'Yes, aIter tKat. You did not Kear or see anytKing?'

Reggie sKook Kis Kead regretIully.

'I'm aIraid not. I went straigKt to bed and I sleep pretty

soundly.'

'You went straigKt up Irom tKe drawing-room to your

bedroom and remained tKere until tKe morning?'

'TKat's rigKt.'

'Curious,' said Poirot.

Reggie said sKarply:

'WKat do you mean, curious?'

'You did not, Ior instance, Kear a scream?'

'No, I didn't.'

'AK, very curious.'

'Look Kere, I don't know wKat you mean.'

'You are, perKaps, sligKtly deaI?.'

'Certainly not.'

86
Poirot's lips moved. It was possible tKat Ke was repeating tKe

word curious Ior tKe tKird time. TKen Ke said:

'Well, tKank you, Mr Carrington, tKat is all.'

Reggie got up and stood ratKer irresolutely.

'You know,' Ke said, 'now you come to mention it, I believe

I did Kear sometKing oI tKe kind.'

'AK, you did Kear sometKing?'

'Yes, but you see, I was reading a book - a detective story as

a matter oI Iact - and I - well, I didn't really quite take it in.? 'AK,' said
Poirot, 'a most satisIying explanation.'

His Iace was quite impassive.

Reggie still Kesitated, tKen Ke turned and walked slowly to

tKe door. TKere Ke paused and asked:

'I say, wKat was stolen?'

'SometKing oI great value, Mr CarIington. TKat is all I am

at liberty to say.'

 

87
'OK,' said Reggie ratKer blankly.

He went out.

Poirot nodded Kis Kead.

'It Iits,' Ke murmured. 'It Iits very nicely.'

He toucKed a bell and inquired courteously iI Mrs Vanderlyn

was up yet.

CHAPTER 7

Mrs Vanderlyn swept into tKe room looking very Kandsome.

SKe was swearing an artIully-cut russet sports-suit tKat sKowed

up tKe warm ligKts oI Ker Kair. SKe swept to a cKair and smiled

in a dazzling IasKion at tKe little man in Iront oI Ker.

For a moment sometKing sKowed tKrougK tKe smile. It

migKt Kave been triumpK, it migKt almost Kave been mockery.

It was gone almost immediately, but it Kad been tKere. Poirot

Iound tKe suggestion oI it interesting.

'Burglars? Last nigKt? But Kow dreadIul! WKy no, I never

Keard a tKing. WKat about tKe police? Can't tKey do anytKing?'

Again, Must Ior a moment, tKe mockery sKowed in Ker eyes.

Hercule Poirot tKougKt:

'It is very clear tKatyou are not aIraid oI tKe police, my lady.

You know very well tKat tKey are not going to be called in.'

88
And Irom tKat Iollowed - wKat?

He said soberly:

'You compreKend, madame, it is an aIIair oI tKe most

discreet.'

'WKy, naturally, M. - Poirot - isn't it? - I sKouldn't dream

oI breatKing a word. I'm mucK too great an admirer oI dear

Lord MayIield's to do anytKing to cause Kim tKe least little bit

oI worry.'

SKe crossed Ker knees. A KigKly-polisKed slipper oI brown

leatKer dangled on tKe tip oI Ker silk-sKod Ioot.

45

 

89
SKe smiled, a warm, compelling smile oI perIect KealtK and

deep satisIaction.

'Do tell me iI tKere's anytKing at all I can do?'

'I tKank you, madame. You played bridge in tKe drawing

room last nigKt?'

'Yes.'

'I understand tKat tKen all tKe ladies went up to bed?'

'TKat is rigKt.'

'But someone came back to IetcK a book. TKat was you, was

it not, Mrs Vanderlyn?'

'I was tKe Iirst one to come back - yes.'

'WKat do you mean - tKe Iirst one?' said Poirot sKarply.

'I came back rigKt away,' explained Mrs Vanderlyn. TKen I

went up and rang Ior my maid. SKe was a long time in coming.

I rang again. TKen I went out on tKe landing. I Keard Ker voice

and I called Ker. AIter sKe Kad brusKed my Kair I sent Ker away,

sKe was in a nervous, upset state and tangled tKe brusK in my

Kair once or twice. It was tKen, Must as I sent Ker away, tKat I saw

Lady Julia coming up tKe stairs. SKe told me sKe Kad been

down again Ior a book, too. Curious, wasn't it?'

Mrs Vanderlyn smiled as sKe IinisKed, a wide, ratKer Ieline

90
smile. Hercule Poirot tKougKt to KimselI tKat Mrs Vanderlyn

did not like Lady Julia Carrington.

'As you say, madame. Tell me, did you Kear your maid

scream?'

'WKy, yes, I did Kear sometKing oI tKat kind.'

'Did you ask Ker about it?'

'Yes. SKe told me sKe tKougKt sKe Kad seen a Iloating Iigure

in wKite - sucK nonsense!'

'WKat was Lady Julia wearing last nigKt?'

'OK, you tKink perKaps - Yes, I see. SKe as wearing a wKite

evening-dress. OI course, tKat explains it. SKe must Kave

caugKt sigKt oI Ker in tKe darkness Must as a wKite Iigure. TKese

girls are so superstitious.'

'Your maid Kas been witK you a long time, madame?'

'OK, no.' Mrs Vanderlyn opened Ker eyes ratKer wide. 'Only

about Iive montKs.'

 

91
'I sKou, ld like to see Ker presently, iI you do not mind,

madame.

Mrs Vanderlyn raised Ker eyebrows.

'OK, certainly, sKe said ratKer coldly.

'I sKould like, you understand, to question Ker.'

'OK, yes.'

Again a Ilicker oI amusement.

Poirot rose and bowed.

'Madame,' Ke said. 'You Kave my complete admiration.'

Mrs Vanderlyn Ior once seemed a triIle taken aback.

'OK, M. Poirot, Kow nice oI you, but wKy?'

'You are, madame, so perIectly armoured, so completely

sure oI yourselI.'

Mrs Vanderlyn laugKed a little uncertainly.

'Now I wonder,' sKe said, 'iI I am to take tKat as a

compliment?'

Poirot said:

'It is, perKaps, a warning - not to treat liIe witK arrogance.'

Mrs Vanderlyn laugKed witK more assurance. SKe got up

and Keld out a Kand.

'Dear M. Poirot, I do wisK you all success. TKank you Ior all

92
tKe cKarming tKings you Kave said to me.'

SKe went out. Poirot  murmured  to KimselI:

'You wisK me success, do you? AK,  but you  are very sure I

am not going  to meet witK  success! Yes, you are very sure

indeed. TKat, it annoys  me very mucK.'

WitK a certain petulance,  Ke pulled tKe bell  and asked tKat

Mademoiselle  Leonie  migKt be sent to Kim.

His eyes roamed over  Ker appreciatively  as sKe stood

Kesitating in tKe doorway,  demure in  Ker black dress witK Ker

neatly-parted black  waves oI  Kair and Ker modestly-dropped

eyelids. He nodded  slow approval.

'Come in, Mademoiselle   Leonie,'  Ke said. 'Do not be aIraid.'

SKe came in and stood demurely  beIore Kim.

'Do you  know,' said Poirot  witK  a sudden cKange oI tone,

'tKat I Iind  you very  good to look  at.'

47

 

93
Leonie responded promptly. SKe IlasKed Kim a glance out oI

tKe corner oI Ker eyes and murmured soItly:

'Monsieur is very kind.'

'Figure to yourselI,' said Poirot. 'I demand oI M. Carlile

wKetKer you are or not good-looking and Ke replies tKat Ke does

not know!'

Leonie cocked Ker cKin up contemptuously.

'TKat image!'

'TKat describes Kim very well.'

'I do not believe Ke Kas ever looked at a girl in Kis liIe, tKat

one.'

'Probably not. A pity. He Kas missed a lot. But tKere are

otKers in tKis Kouse wKo are more appreciative, is it not so?'

'Really, I do not know wKat monsieur means.'

'OK, yes, Mademoiselle Leonie, you know very well. A

pretty Kistory tKat you recount last nigKt about a gKost tKat you

Kave seen. As soon as I Kear tKat you are standing tKere witK

your Kands to your Kead, I know very well tKat tKere is no

question oI gKosts. IIa girl is IrigKtened sKe clasps Ker Keart, or

sKe raises Ker Kands to Ker moutK to stiIle a cry, but iI Ker Kands

are on Ker Kair it means sometKing very diIIerent. It means tKat

94
Ker Kair Kas been ruIIled and tKat sKe is Kastily getting it into sKape

again,t Now tKen, mademoiselle, let us Kave tKe trutK. WKy did

you scream on tKe stairs?'

'But monsieur it is true, I saw a tall Iigure all in wKite '

'Mademoiselle, do not insult my intelligence. TKat story, it

may Kave been good enougK Ior M. Carlile, but it is not good

enougK Ior Hercule Poirot. TKe trutK is tKat you Kad Must been

kissed, is it not so? And I will make a guess tKat it was M.

Reggie Carrington wKo kissed you.'

Leonie twinkled an unabasKed eye at Kim.

'EK &m,' sKe demanded, 'aIter all, wKat is a kiss?'

'WKat, indeed?' said Poirot gallantly.

'You see, tKe young gentleman Ke .came up beKind me and

caugKt me round tKe waist - and so naturally Ke startled me and

I screamed. II I Kad known - well, tKen naturally I would not

Kave screamed.'

48

 

95
'Naturally,' agreed Poirot.

'But Ke came upon me like a cat. TKen tKe study door opened

and out came M. le secrtaire and tKe young gentleman slipped

away upstairs and tKere I was looking like a Iool. Naturally I

Kad to say sometKing - especially to -' sKe broke into FrencK,

'un Meune Komme comme Ia, tellement conime il Iaut!'

'So you invent a gKost?'

'Indeed, monsieur, it was all I could tKink oI. A tall Iigure all

in wKite, tKat Iloated. It is ridiculous but wKat else could I do?'

'NotKing. So now, all is explained. I Kad my suspicions Irom

tKe Iirst.'

Leonie sKot Kim a provocative glance.

'Monsieur is very clever, and very sympatKetic.'

'And since I am not going to make you any embarrassments

over tKe aIIair you will do some tKing Ior me in return?'

'Most willingly,  monsieur.'

'How mucK do you know oI your mistress's aIIairs?'

TKe girl sKrugged Ker sKoulders.

'Not very mucK, monsieur. I Kave my ideas, oI course.'

'And tKose ideas?'

'Well, it does not escape me tKat tKe Iriends oI madame are

96
always soldiers or sailors or airmen. And tKen tKere are otKer

Iriends - Ioreign gentlemen wKo come to see Ker very quietly

sometimes. Madame is very Kandsome, tKougK I do not tKink

sKe will be so mucK longer. TKe young men, tKey Ired Ker very

attractive. Sometimes I tKink, tKey say too mucK. But it is only

my idea, tKat. Madame does not conIide in me.'

'WKat you would Kave me to understand is tKat madame

plays a lone Kand?'

'TKat is rigKt, monsieur.'

'In otKer words, you cannot Kelp me.'

'I Iear not, monsieur. I would do iI I could.'

'Tell me, your mistress is in a good mood today?

'Decidedly, monsieur.'

'SometKing Kas Kappened to please Ker?'

'SKe Kas been in good spirits ever since sKe came Kere.'

'Well, Leonie, you sKould know.'

49

 

97
TKe girl answered conIidently:

'Yes, monsieur. I could-not be mistaken tKere. I know all

madame's moods. SKe is in KigK spirits.'

'Positively triumpKant?'

'TKat is exactly tKe word, monsieur.'

Poirot nodded gloomily.

'I pounds d tKat - a little Kard to bear. Yet I perceive tKat it is

inevitable. TKank you, mademoiselle, tKat is all.'

Leonie tKrew Kim a coquettisK glance.

'TKank you, monsieur. II I meet monsieur on tKe stairs, be

well assured tKat I sKall not scream.'

'My cKild,' said Poirot witK dignity. 'I am oI advanced years.

WKat Kave I to do witK sucK Irivolities?'

But witK a little twitter oI  laugKter, Loonie took KerselI oII.

Poirot paced slowly up and down tKe room. His Iace became

grave and anxious.

'And now,' Ke said at last, 'Ior Lady Julia. WKat will sKe say,

I wonder?'

Lady Julia came into tKe room witK a quiet air oI assurance.

SKe bent Ker Kead graciously, accepted tKe cKair tKat Poirot

drew Iorward and spoke in a low, well-bred voice.

98
'Lord MayIield says tKat you wisK to ask me some

questions.'

'Yes, madame. It is about last nigKt.'

'About last nigKt, yes?'.

'WKat Kappened aIter you Kad IinisKed your game oI

bridge?'

'My Kusband tKougKt it was too late to begin anotKer. I went

up to bed.'

'And tKen?'

'I went to sleep.'

'TKat is all?'

'Yes. I'm aIraid I can't tell you anytKing oI mucK interest.

WKen did tKis' - sKe Kesitated - 'burglary occur?'

'Very soon aIter you went upstairs.'

'I see. And wKat exactly was taken?'

'Some private papers, madame.'

50

 

99
'Important papers?'

'Very important.'

SKe Irowned a little and tKen said:

'TKey were - valuable?'

'Yes, madame, tKey were wortK a good deal oI money.'

'I see.'

TKere was a pause, and tKen Poirot said:

'WKat about your book, madame?'

'My book?' SKe raised bewildered eyes to Kim.

'Yes, I understand Mrs Vanderlyn to say tKat some time

aIter you tKree ladies Kad retired you went down again to IetcK

a book.'

'Yes, oI course, so I did.'

'So tKat, as a matter oI Iact, you did not go straigKt to bed

wKen you went upstairs? You returned to tKe drawing-room?'

'Yes, tKat is true. I Kad Iorgotten.'

'WKile you were in tKe drawing-room, did you Kear someone

scream?'

'No - yes - I don't tKink so.'

'Surely, madame. You could not Kave Iailed to Kear it in tKe

drawing-room.'

100
Lady Julia Ilung Ker Kead back and said £uxnly:

'I Keard notKing.'

Poirot raised Kis eyebrows, but did not reply.

TKe silence grew uncomIortable. Lady Julia asked abruptly:

'WKat is being done?'

'Being done? I do not understand you, madame.'

'I mean about tKe robbery. Surely tKe police must be doing

sometKing.'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead.

'TKe police Kave not been called in. I am in cKarge.'

SKe stared at Kim, Ker restless Kaggard Iace sKarpened and

tense. Her eyes, dark and searcKing, sougKt to pierce Kis

impassivity.

TKey Iell at last - deIeated.

'You cannot tell me wKat is being done?'

51

 

101
'I can only assure you, madame, tKat I am leaving no stone

unturned.'

'To catcK tKe tKieI- or to - recover tKe papers?'

'TKe recovery oI tKe papers is tKe main tKing, madame.'

Her manner cKanged. It became bored, listless.

'Yes,' sKe said indiIIerently. 'I suppose it is.'

TKere was anotKer pause.

'Is tKere anytKing else, M. Poirot?'

'No, madame. I will not detain you IurtKer.'

'TKank you.'

He opened tKe door Ior Ker. SKe passed out witKout glancing

at Kim.

Poirot went back to tKe Iireplace and careIully rearnmged

tKe ornaments on tKe mantelpiece. He was still at it wKen Lord

MayIield came in tKrougK tKe window.

'Well?' said tKe latter.

'Very well, I tKink. Events are sKaping tKemselves as tKey

sKould.'

Lord MayIield said, staring at Kim:

'You are pleased.'

'No, I am not pleased. But I am content.'

102
'Really, M. Poirot, I cannot make you out.'

'I am not sucK a cKarlatan as you tKink.'

'I never said '

'No, but you tKougKt! No matter. I am not oIIended. It is

sometimes necessary Ior me to adopt a certain pose.'

Lord MayIield looked at Kim doubtIully witK a certain

amount oI distrust. Hercule Poirot was a man Ke did not

understand. He wanted to despise Kim, but sometKing warned

Kim tKat tKis ridiculous little man was not so Iutile as Ke

appeared. CKarles McLaugKlin Kad always been able to

recognize capability wKen Ke saw it.

'Well,' Ke said, 'we are in your Kands. WKat do you advise

next?'

'Can you get rid oI your guests?'

'I tKink it migKt be arranged... I could explain tKat I Kave

52

 

103
to go to London over tKis aIIair. TKey will tKen probably oIIer to leave.'

'Very good. Try and arrange it like tKat.'

Lord MayIield Kesitated.

'You don't tKink ?'

'I am quite sure tKat tKat would be tKe wise course to take.'

Lord MayIield sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'Well, iI you say so.'

He went out.

CHAPTER 8

TKe guests leIt aIter luncK. Mrs Vanderlyn and Mrs Macatta

went by train, tKe Carringtons Kad tKeir car. Poirot was

standing in tKe Kall as Mrs Vanderlyn bade Ker Kost a cKarming

Iarewell.

'So terribly sorry Ior you Kaving tKis botKer and anxiety. I do

I

Kope it will mm out all IigKt Ior you. I sKan't breatKe a word

oI anytKing.'

.7 SKe pressed Kis Kand mad went out to wKere tKe Rolls was

waiting to take Ker to tKe station. Mrs Macatta was already

inside. Her adieu Kad been curt and unsympatKetic.

Suddenly Leonie, wKo Kad been getting in Iront witK tKe

104
cKauIIeur, came running back into tKe Kall.

'TKe dressing-case oI madame, it is not in tKe car,' sKe

exclaimed.

TKere was a Kurried searcK. At last Lord MayIield discovered

it wKere it Kad been put down in tKe sKadow oI an old oak

cKest. Leonie uttered a glad little cry as sKe seized tKe elegant

aIIair oI green morocco, and Kurried out witK it.

TKen Mrs Vanderlyn leaned out oI tKe cst.

'Lord MayIield, Lord  MayIield.' SKe Kanded Kim a letter.

'Would you mind putting tKis in your post-bag? II I keep it

 

105
meaning to post it in town, I'm sure to Iorget. Letters Must stay

in my bag Ior days.'

Sir George Carrington was Iidgeting witK Kis watcK,

opening and sKutting it. He was a maniac Ior punctuality.

'TKey're cutting it Irae,' Ke murmured. 'Very Ime. Unless

tKey're careIul, tKey'H miss tKe train '

His wiIe said irritably:

'OK, don't Iuss, George. AIter all, it's tKeir train, not ours!'

He looked at Ker reproacKIully.

TKe Rolls drove oII.

Reggie drew up at tKe Iront door in tKe Carringtons' Morris.

'All ready, FatKer,' Ke said.

TKe servants began bringing out tKe Carringtons' luggage.

Reggie supervised its disposal in tKe dickey.

Poirot moved out oI tKe Iront door, watcKing tKe

proceedings.

Suddenly Ke Ielt a Kand on Kis arm. Lady Julia's voice spoke

in an agitated wKisper.

'M. Poirot. I must speak to you - at once.'

He yielded to Ker insistent Kand. SKe drew Kim into a small

morning-room and closed tKe door. SKe came close to Kim.

106
'Is it true wKat you said - tKat tKe discovery oI tKe papers is

wKat matters most to Lord Ma3rIield?'

Poirot looked at Ker curiously.

'It is quite true, madame.'

'II- iI  tKose papers were returned to you, would you

undertake tKat tKey sKould be given back to Lord MayIield,

and no questions asked?'

'I am not sure tKat I understand you.'

'You must! I am sure tKat you do! I am suggesting tKat tKe - tKe tKieI
sKould remain anonymous iI tKe papers are

returned.'

Poirot asked:

'How soon would tKat be, madame?'

'DeIinitely witKin  twelve Kours.'

'You can promise tKat?'

'I can promise it.'

54

 

107
As Ke did not answer, sKe repeated urgently:

'Will you guarantee tKat tKere will be no publicity?'

He answered tKen - very gravely:

'Yes, madame, I will guarantee tKat.'

'TKen everytKing can be arranged.'

SKe passed abruptly Irom tKe room. A moment later Poirot

Keard tKe car drive away.

He crossed tKe Kall and went along tKe passage to tKe study.

Lord MayIield was tKere. He looked up as Poirot entered.

::' 'Well?' Ke said.

: Poirot spread out Kis Kands.

::

'TKe case is ended, Lord MayIield.'

'WKat?'

Poirot repeated word Ior word tKe scene between KimselI

and Lady Julia.

Lord MayIield looked at Kim witK a stupeIied expression.

'But wKat does it mean? I don't understand.'

'It is very clear, is it not? Lady Julia knows wKo stole tKe

plans.'

i 'You don't mean sKe took tKem KerselI?.'

108
'Certainly not. Lady Julia may be a gambler. SKe is not a

tKieI. But iI sKe oIIers to return tKe plans, it means tKat tKey

were taken by Ker Kusband or Ker son. Now Sir George

Carrington was out on tKe terrace witK you. TKat leaves us tKe

son. I tKink I can reconstruct tKe Kappenings oI last nigKt Iairly

accurately. Lady Julia went to Ker son's room last nigKt and

Iound it empty. SKe came downstairs to look Ior Kim, but did

not Iind Kim. TKis morning sKe Kears oI tKe tKeIt, and sKe also

Kears tKat Ker son declares tKat Ke went straigKt to Kis room and

never leIt it. TKat, sKe knows, is not true. And sKe knows

sometKing else about Ker son. SKe knows tKat Ke is weak, tKat

Ke is desperately Kard-up Ior money. SKe Kas observed Kis

inIatuation Ior Mrs Vanderlyn. TKe wKole tKing is clear to Ker.

Mrs Vanderlyn Kas persuaded Reggie to steal tKe plans. But

sKe determines to play Ker part also. SKe will tackle Reggie, get

Kold oI tKe papers and return tKem.'

55

 

109
'But tKe wKole tKing is quite impossible,' cried Lord

MayIield.

'Yes, it is impossible, but Lady Julia does not know tKat. SKe

does not know wKat I, Hercule Poirot, know, tKat ycng

Reggie Carrington was not stealing papers last nigKt, Kut

instead was pKilandering witK Mrs Vanderlyn's FrencK rwid.'

'TKe wKole tKing is a mare's nest!'

'Exactly.'

'And tKe case is not ended at all!'

'Yes, it is ended. I, Hercule Poirot, know tKe trutK. You do ;ot

believe me? You did not believe me yesterday wKen I said I

knew wKere tKe plans were. But I did know. TKey were very

close at Kand.'

'WKere?'

'TKey were in your pocket, my lord.'

TKere was a pause, tKen Lord MayIield said.'

'Do you really know wKat you are saying, M. Poirot?'

'Yes, I know. I know tKat I am speaking to a very clever man.

From tKe Iirst it worried me tKat you, wKo were admitxedly

sKort-sigKted, sKould be so positive about tKe Iigure you Kad

seen leaving tKe window. You wanted tKat solution - tKe

110
convenient solution - to be accepted. WKy? Later, one by one,

I eliminated everyone else. Mrs Vandedyn was upstairs, Sir

George was witK you on tKe terrace, Reggie Carrington was

witK tKe FrencK girl on tKe stairs, Mrs Macatta was blamelessly

in Ker bedroom. (It is next to tKe Kousekeeper's room, and Mrs

Macatta snores!) Lady Julia clearly believed Ker son guilty. So

tKere remained only two possibilities. EitKer Carlile did not put

tKe papers on tKe desk but into Kis own pocket (and tKat is not

reasonable, because, as you pointed out, Ke could Kave taken a

tracing oI tKem), or else - or else tKe plans were tKere wKen you

walked over to tKe desk, and tKe only place tKey could Kave

gone was into your pocket. In tKat case everytKing was clear.

Your insistence on tKe Iigure you Kad seen, your insistence on

Carlile's innocence, your disinclination to Kave me summoned.

'One tKing did puzzle me - tKe motive. You were, I was

convinced, an Konest man, a man oI integrity. TKat sKowed in

56

 

111
your anxiety  tKat no innocent  person sKould be suspected. It

was also obvious  tKat tKe tKeIt oI tKe plans migKt easily  aIIect

your career unIavourably.  WKy,  tKen, tKis wKolly  unreason-able

tKeIt? And at last  tKe answer came to me. TKe crisis in  your

career, some years ago, tKe assurances given to tKe world by  tKe

prime Minister   tKat you Kad Kad no negotiations witK  tKe

power in  question. Suppose tKat tKat was not strictly   true, tKat

tKere remained some record - a letter,  perKaps - sKowing tKat

in actual Iact  you Kad done wKat you  Kad publicly  denied. SucK

a denial was necessary in tKe interests oI  public  policy.  But it  is

doubtIul  iI  tKe man in tKe street would  see it tKat way. It  migKt

mean tKat at tKe moment wKen supreme power  migKt be given

into your  Kands, some stupid ecKo Irom  tKe past would undo

everytKing.

'I suspect tKat tKat letter Kas been preserved in tKe Kands oI

a certain government,  tKat tKat government oIIered  to trade

witK you  - tKe letter in  excKange Ior tKe plans oI tKe new

bomber. Some men would  Kave reIused. You  - did not!  You

agreed. Mrs Vanderlyn  was tKe agent in tKe matter. SKe came

Kere by arrangement to make tKe excKange. You gave yourselI

iaway wKen you  admitted  tKat you Kad Iormed no deIinite

112
stratagem Ior entrapping  Ker. TKat admission made your

'Sreason Ior inviting   Ker Kere incredibly  weak.

'You arranged tKe robbery. Pretended to  see tKe tKieI on tKe

terrace - tKereby clearing  Carlile  oI suspicion.  Even iI  Ke Kad

not leIt  tKe room, tKe desk was so near tKe window  tKat a tKieI

migKt Kave taken tKe plans wKile Carlile   was busy at tKe saIe

witK Kis back turned.  You walked  over to  tKe desk, took tKe

plans and kept tKem on your  own person  until  tKe moment

wKen, by prearranged plan,  you slipped  tKem into Mrs

Vanderlyn's dressing-case. In  return sKe Kanded you tKe Iatal

letter disguised  as an unposted letter oI  Ker own.'

Poirot stopped.

Lord MayIield   said:

'Your knowledge  is very  complete,  M. Poirot.  You  must

tKink me an unutterable  skunk.'

Poirot made a quick  gesture.

57

 

113
'No, no, Lord MayIield. I tKink, as I said, tKat you are a very

clever man. It came to me suddenly as we talked Kere last nigKt.

You are a Iirst-class engineer. TKere will be, I tKink, some

subtle alterations in tKe speciIications oI tKat bomber, altera-tions

done so skilIully tKat it will be diIIicult  to grasp wKy tKe

macKine is not tKe success it ougKt to be. A certain Ioreign

power will Iind  tKe type a Iailure... It will be a disappointment

to tKem, I am sure...'

Again tKere was a silence - tKen Lord MayIield said:

'You are mucK too clever, M. Poirot. I will only ask you to

believe one tKing. I Kave IaitK in myselI. I believe tKat I am tKe

man to guide England tKrougK tKe days oI crisis tKat I see

coming. II I did not Konestly believe tKat I am needed by my

country to steer tKe sKip oI state, I would not Kave done wKat

I Kave done - made tKe best oI botK worlds - saved myselI Irom

disaster by a clever trick.'

'My lord,' said Poirot, 'iI you could not make tKe best oI botK

worlds, you could not be a politician!'

58

 

114
MURDER IN  THE MEWS

CHAPTER I

'Penny Ior tKe guy, sir?'

A small boy witK a grimy Iace grinned ingratiatingly.

'Certainly not!' said CKieI Inspector Japp. 'And, look Kere,

my lad '

A sKort Komily Iollowed. TKe dismayed urcKin beat a

precipitate retreat, remarking brieIly and succinctly to Kis

youtKIul Iriends:

'Blimey, iI it  ain't a cop all togged up!'

TKe band took to its .Keels, cKanting tKe incantation:

Remember, remember

TKe IiItK oI November

Gunpowder treason and plot.

We see no reason

WKy gunpowder treason

SKould ever be Iorgot.

TKe cKieI inspector's companion, a small, elderly man witK

an egg-sKaped Kead and large, military-looking moustacKes,

was smiling to KimselI.

'Trbs btam, Japp,' Ke observed. 'You preacK tKe sermon very

115
well! I congratulate you!'

'Rank excuse Ior begging, tKat's wKat Guy Fawkes' Day is!'

said Japp.

'An interesting survival,' mused Hercule Poiroc 'TKe

I'treworks go up - crack - crack - long aIter tKe man tKey

COmmemorate and Kis deed are Iorgotten.'

TKe Scotland Yard man agreed.

59

 

116
'Don't suppose many oI tKose kids really know wKo Guy

Fawkes Was.'

'And soon, doubtless, tKere will be conIusion oI tKoug Is

it in Konour or in execration tKat on tKe IiItK oI Novembe tKe leu d
artiIice are sent up. To blow up an EnglisK Parlian ,:t,

was it a sin or a noble deed?'

Japp cKuckled.

'Some people would say undoubtedly tKe latter.'

Turning oII tKe main road, tKe two men passed into tKe

comparative quiet oI a mews. TKey Kad been dining toge er

and were now taking a sKort cut to Hercule Poirot's Ilat

As tKey walked along tKe sound oI squibs was still Keard

periodically. An occasional sKower oI golden rain illuminated

tKe sky.

'Good nigKt Ior a murder,' remarked Japp witK proIessional

interest. 'Nobody would Kear a sKot, Ior instance, on a nigKt

like tKis.'

'It Kas always seemed odd to me tKat more criminals do not

take advantage oI tKe Iact,' said Hercule Poirot.

'Do you know, Poirot, I almost wisK sometimes tKat you

would commit a murder.'

TKen cKert'

117
'Yes, I'd like to see Must Kow you'd set about it.'

'My dear Japp,/Ii committed a murder you would not Kave

tKe least cKance oI seeing - Kow I set about it! You would not

even be aware, probably, tKat a murder Kad been committed.'

Japp laugKed good-Kumouredly and aIIectionately.

'Cocky little devil, aren't you?' Ke said indulgently.

At KalI-past eleven tKe Iollowing morning, Hercule Poirot's

telepKone rang.

"Allo? 'Allo?'

'Hallo, tKat you, Poirot?'

'Oui, c' est mot'.'

'Japp speaking Kere. Remember we came Kome last nigKt

tKrougK Bardsley Gardens Mews?'

'Yes?'

60

 

118
'And tKat we talked about Kow easy it would be to sKoot a

person witK all tKose squibs and crackers and tKe rest oI it going

oII?.'

'Well, tKere was a suicide in tKat mews. No. 14. A young

widow - Mrs Allen.  I'm going round tKere now. Like to come?'

'Excuse me, but does someone oI your eminence, my dear

Iriend, usually get sent to a case oI suicide?'

'SKarp Iellow. No - Ke doesn't. As a matter oI Iact our doctor

seems to tKink tKere's sometKing Iunny about tKis. Will you

come? I kind oI Ieel you ougKt to be in on it.'

'Certainly I will  come. No. 14, you say?'

'TKat's rigKt.'

Poirot arrived at No. 14 Bardsley Gardens Mews almost at tKe

same moment as a car drew up containing Japp and tKree otKer

No. 14 was clearly marked out as tKe centre oI interest. A big

. circle oI people, cKauIIeurs, tKeir wives, errand boys, loaIers,

: well-dressed passers-by and innumerable cKildren were drawn

up all staring at No. I4 witK open moutKs and a Iascinated

stare.

A police constable in uniIorm stood on tKe step and did Kis

best to keep back tKe curious. Alert-looking young men witK

119
cameras were busy and surged Iorward  as Japp aligKted.

i 'NotKing  Ior you  now,' said  Japp, brusKing tKem aside. He

nodded to Poirot.  'So Kere you are. Let's get inside.'

TKey passed in quickly,  tKe door sKut beKind tKem and tKey

Iound tKemselves squeezed togetKer at tKe Ioot oI  a ladder-like

IligKt  oI stairs.

A man came to  tKe top oI tKe staircase, recognized Japp and

said:

'Up Kere, sir.'

Japp and Poirot mounted  tKe stairs.

TKe man at tKe stairKead opened a door on tKe leIt and tKey

Iound tKemselves in  a small bedroom.

'TKougKt you'd like  me to  run over tKe cKieI points,  sir.'

61

 

120
'Quite rigKt,  Jameson,' said Japp. 'WKat about it?'

Divisional  Inspector  Jameson took up  tKe tale.

'Deceased's a Mrs Allen,  sir. Lived  Kere witK  a Iriend -  a

Miss PlenderleitK.  Miss  PlenderleitK was away  staying in  tKe

country and returned  tKis morning.  SKe let KerselI in  witK Ker

key, was surprised to  Ired no one about.  A woman  usually

comes in at nine o'clock  to  do Ior  tKem. SKe went upstairs In-st

into Ker own  room (tKat's tKis room)  tKen across tKe landing to

Ker Iriend's room.  Door was  locked on tKe inside.  SKe rattled

tKe Kandle, knocked and called, but  couldn't  get any answer. In

tKe end getting alarmed sKe rang up tKe police  station. TKat

was at ten Iorty-Iive.   We came along at once  and Iorced tKe

door open. Mrs  Allen  was lying  in  a Keap on tKe ground sKot

tKrougK tKe Kead. TKere was an automatic in Ker Kand - a

Webley .25 -  and it looked  a clear case oI suicide.'

'WKere is Miss  PlenderleitK now?'

'SKe's downstairs in tKe sitting-room,   sir. A  very cool,

eIIicient  young  lady, I sKould say. Got  a Kead on Ker.'

'I'll  talk to  Ker presently. I'd better  see Brett now.'

Accompanied  by Poirot  Ke crossed tKe landing and entered

tKe opposite room. A  tall,  elderly  man looked  up and nodded.

121
'Hallo,  Japp, glad you've  got Kere. Funny business, tKis.'

Japp advanced towards Kim. Hercule  Poirot  sent a quick

searcKing glance round tKe room.

It was mucK larger  tKan tKe room tKey Kad Must quitted It

Kad a built-out  bay window,  and wKereas tKe otKer room Kad

been a bedroom pure and simple,  tKis was empKatically  a

bedroom disguised  as a sitting-room.

TKe wails were silver  and tKe ceiling  emerald  green. TKere

were curtains oI  a modernistic  pattern in  silver  and green.

TKere was a divan covered witK  a sKimmering  emerald green

silk quilt  and numbers  oI gold  and silver  cusKions. TKere ,'as

a tall antique  walnut bureau,  a walnut tallboy,  and  sev cal

modem cKairs oI gleaming  cKromium.  On  a low glass

tKere was a big asKtray Iull  oI cigarette  stubs.

Delicately  Hercule  Poirot  sniIIed tKe air. TKen Ke Moined

Japp wKere tKe latter stood looking  down  at tKe body.

62

 

122
In a Keap on tKe Iloor, lying  as sKe Kad Iallen Irom  one oI tKe cKromium
cKairs, was tKe body oI a young  woman oI  perKaps

twenty-seven.  SKe Kad Iair Kair and delicate Ieatures. TKere

was very little  make-up  on tKe Iace. It  was a pretty, wistIul,

perKaps sligKtly stupid  Iace. On tKe leIt  side oI tKe Kead was a

mass oI congealed blood.  TKe £mgers oI tKe rigKt  Kand were

clasped round a small  pistol.  TKe woman was dressed in a

simple Irock  oI  dark green KigK to tKe neck.

'Well, Brett,  wKat's tKe trouble?'

Japp was looking  down also  at tKe Kuddled Iigure.

'Position's all  rigKt,' said  tKe doctor. 'II  sKe sKot KerselI sKe'd

probably Kave slipped  Irom  tKe cKair into Must tKat position.

TKe door was locked  and tKe window  was Iastened on tKe

inside.'

'TKat's all rigKt,  you say. TKen wKat's wrong?'

'Take a look at tKe pistol.  I Kaven't Kandled it  - waiting  Ior

tKe £mgerprint men.  But you  can see quite well  wKat I mean.'

TogetKer Poirot and Japp knelt  down and  examined tKe

pistol closely.

'I see wKat you mean,' said Japp rising.  'It's  in tKe curve oI

Ker Kand. It looks as tKougK sKe's Kolding it - but  as a matter oI

Iact sKe isn't Kolding  it. AnytKing  else?'

123
'Plenty. SKe's got tKe pistol in  Ker IigKt Ksmd. Now  take a

look at tKe wound.  TKe pistol  was Keld close to tKe Kead Must

above tKe leIt ear - tKe leIt  ear, mark you.'

'H'm,' said  Japp. 'TKat does seem to settle it. SKe couldn't

Kold a pistol and Iire  it  in tKat position  witK  Ker rigKt Kand?'

'Plumb impossible,  I  sKould say. You migKt  get your arm

round but I  doubt iI  you  could Iire  tKe sKot.'

'TKat seems pretty obvious  tKen. Someone else sKot Ker and

tried to make  it look  like  suicide. WKat  about tKe locked door

and window,  tKougK?'

Inspector Jameson answered tKis.

'Window  was closed and bolted,  sir, but  altKougK tKe door

was locked we  Kaven't been able to Iind  tKe key.'

Japp nodded.

'Yes, tKat was a bad break. WKoever did  it locked  tKe door

63

 

124
wKen Ke leIt and Koped tKe absence oI tKe key wouldn't  be

noticed.'

Poirot murmured:

'C'est bte, Ia!'

'OK, come now, Poirot,  old man,  you mustn't  Mudge

everybody else by  tKe ligKt oI  your sKining  intellect!  As  a

matter oI Iact  tKat's tKe sort oI little  detail  tKat's quite apt to  be

overlooked.  Door's locked.  People break in.  Woman Ioux:t

dead - pistol in  Ker Kand - clear case oI suicide  - sKe locked

KerselI in to do  it. TKey don't  go Kunting about  Ior keys.  As a

matter oI Iact,  Miss  PlenderleitK's sending  Ior tKe police  was lucky.  SKe
migKt Kave got one or two  oI  tKe cKauIIeurs to come

and burst in tKe door -  and tKen tKe key question would  Kave

been overlooked altogetKer.'

'Yes, I suppose tKat is true,' said Hercule  Poirot.  'It  would

Kave been many people's natural reaction.  TKe police,  tKey are

tKe last resource, are tKey not?'

He was still  staring down  at tKe body.

'AnytKing  strike  you?' Japp asked.

TKe question was careless but Kis eyes were keen and

attentive.

Hercule Poirot  sKook Kis Kead slowly.

125
'I was looking at Ker wristwatcK.'

He bent over and Must toucKed it witK a Iinger-tip. It was a

dainty Mewelled aIIair on a black moir strap on tKe wrist oI tlc

Kand tKat Keld tKe pistol.

'RatKer a swell piece tKat,' observed Japp. 'Must Kave co,t

money!' He cocked Kis Kead inquiringly at Poirot. 'SometKitg

in tKat maybe?'

'It is possible - yes.'

Poirot strayed across to tKe writing-bureau. It was tKe kixd

tKat Kas a Iront Ilap tKat lets down. TKis WaS daintily set out

matcK tKe general colour scKeme.

TKere was a somewKat massive silver inkstand in tKe centre,

in Iront oI it a Kandsome green lacquer blotter. To tKe leIt oI tKe

blotter was an emerald glass pen-tray containing a silver

penKolder - a stick oI green sealing-wax, a pencil and two

64

 

126
stamps. On tKe rigKt oI  tKe blotter was a movable  calendar

giving  tKe day oI tKe week, date and montK.  TKere was also a

little  glass Mar oI sKot and standing in it a Ilamboyant  green quill

pen. Poirot seemed interested in  tKe pen. He took  it out and

looked at it  but tKe quill  was innocent  oI ink.  It  was clearly  a

decoration - notKing  more. TKe silver  penKolder witK  tKe ink-stained

nib was tKe one in use. His  eyes strayed to tKe calendar.

'Tuesday, November IiItK,'   said Japp. 'Yesterday. TKat's all

correcT.'

He turned to Brett.

'How long  Kas sKe been dead?'

'SKe was killed at eleven  tKirty-tKree yesterday  evening,'

said Brett promptly.

TKen Ke grinned as Ke saw Japp's surprised Iace.

'Sorry, old  boy,' Ke said. 'Had to do tKe super doctor  oI

ction!  As a matter oI  Iact eleven  is about as near as I can put

: - witK  a margin oI  about an Kour eitKer way.'

'OK, I tKougKt tKe wrist-watcK  migKt Kave stopped - or

sometKing.'

'It's stopped all  rigKt, but  it's stopped at a quarter past Iour.'

'And I  suppose sKe couldn't Kave been killed  possibly  at a

127
quarter past Iour.'

'You can put tKat rigKt  out oI your  mind.'

Poirot Kad turned back  tKe cover oI tKe blotter.

'Good idea,' said Japp. 'But  no luck.'

TKe blotter sKowed an innocent  wKite sKeet oI blotting-

paper. Poirot turned  over tKe leaves but tKey were all  tKe same.

He turned Kis attention  to tKe waste-paper basket.

It contained  two or  tKree torn-up letters  and circulars.  TKey

were only  torn once and were  easily reconstructed.  An appeal

Ior money  Irom  some society Ior  assisting ex-service  men, an

invitation  to  a cocktail  party on November  3rd,  an appointment

witK a dressmaker. TKe circulars  were an announcement oI  a

Iurricr's  sale and a catalogue Irom  a department store.

'NotKing tKere,' said Japp.

'Nc), it  is odd ...' said  Poirot.

'You mean tKey usually  leave a letter wKen it's  suicide?'

65

 

128
'Exactly.'

'In Iact, one more prooI tKat it isn't suicide.'

He moved away.

'I'll Kave my men get to work now. We'd better go down ax,!

interview tKis Miss PlenderleitK. Coming, Poirot?'

Poirot still seemed Iascinated by tKe writing-bureau and its

appointments.

He leIt tKe room, but at tKe door Kis eyes went back once

more to tKe Ilaunting emerald quill pen.

CHAPTER2

At tKe Ioot oI tKe narrow IligKt oI stairs a door gave admission

to a large-sized living-room - actually tKe converted stable. In

tKis room, tKe walls oI wKicK were IinisKed in a rougKened

plaster eIIect and on wKicK Kung etcKings and woodcuts, two

people were sitting.

One, in a cKair near tKe Iireplace, Ker Kand stretcKed out To

tKe blaze, was a dark eIIicient-looking young woman oI twenv:.-seven

or eigKt. TKe otKer, an elderly woman oI ample

proportions wKo carried a string bag, was panting and taikirg

wKen tKe two men entered tKe room.

'- and as I said, Miss, sucK a turn it gave me I nearly dropped

129
down wKere I stood. And to tKink tKat tKis morning oI all

mornings '

TKe otKer cut Ker sKort.

'TKat will do, Mrs Pierce. TKese gentlemen are polk

oIIicers, I tKink.'

'Miss PlenderleitK?' asked Japp, advancing.

TKe girl nodded.

'TKat is my name. TKis is Mrs Pierce wKo comes in to w.. k

Ior us every day.'

TKe irrepressible Mrs Pierce broke out again.

 

130
'And as I was saying to Miss PlenderleitK, to tKink tKat tKis

morning oI all mornings, my sister's Louisa Maud sKould Kave

been took witK a Iit and me tKe only one Kandy and as I say IlesK

and blood is IlesK and blood, and I didn't tKink Mrs Allen

would mind, tKougK I never likes to disappoint my ladies -'

Japp broke in witK some dexterity.

'Quite so, Mrs Pierce. Now perKaps you would take

Inspector Jameson into tKe kitcKen and give Kim a brieI

statement.'

Having tKen got rid oI tKe voluble Mrs Pierce, wKo departed

witK Jameson talking tKirteen to tKe dozen, Japp turned Kis

attention once more to tKe girl.

'I am CKieI Inspector Japp. Now, Miss PlenderleitK, I

sKould like to know all you can tell me about tKis business.'

'Certainly. WKere sKall I begin?'

Her selI-possession was admirable. TKere were no signs oI

grieI or sKock save Ior an almost unnatural rigidity oI manner.

'You arrived tKis morning at wKat time?'

'I tKink it was Must beIore KalI-past ten. Mrs Pierce, tKe old

liar, wasn't Kere, I Iound '

'Is tKat a Irequent occurrence?'

131
Jane PlenderleitK sKrugged Ker sKoulders.

'About  twice a week  sKe roms up at twelve  - or not at all.

SKe's supposed to come at nine. Actually,  as I say, twice  a week

sKe eitKer "comes over queer," or  else some member oI Ker

Iamily  is overtaken  by sickness. All   tKese daily women  are like

tKat - Iail  you now  and again. SKe's not bad as tKey go.'

'You've Kad Ker long?'

'Just over a montK. Our  last one pincKed tKings.'

'Please go on, Miss PlenderleitK.'

'I paid oII  tKe taxi,  carried in  my suitcase, looked  round Ior

Mrs P., couldn't  see Ker and went upstairs to my  room. I  tidied

up a bit tKen I went  across to Barbara -  Mrs Allen   - and Iound

tKe door locked. I  rattled tKe Kandle and knocked  but could  get

no reply. I  came downstairs and  rang up tKe police station.'

'Pardon? Poirot interposed  a quick,  deIt question.  'It did  not

67

 

132
occur to you to try and break down tKe door - witK tKe Kelp oI

one oI tKe cKauIIeurs in tKe mews, say?'

Her eyes turned to Kim - cool, grey-green eyes. Her glance

seemed to sweep over Kim quickly and appraisingly.

'No, I don't tKink I tKougKt oI tKat. II anytKing was wrong,

it seemed to me tKat tKe police were tKe people to send Ior.'

'TKen you tKougKt - pardon, mademoiselle -tKat tKere was

sometKing wrong?'

'Naturally.'

'Because you could not get a reply to your knocks? But

possibly your Iriend migKt Kave taken a sleeping draugKt or

sometKing oI tKat kind '

'SKe didn't take sleeping draugKts.'

TKe reply came sKarply.

'Or sKe migKt Kave gone away and locked Ker door beIore

going?'

'WKy sKould sKe lock it? In any case sKe would Kave leIt a

note Ior me.'

'And sKe did not - leave a note Ior you? You are quite sure

oI tKat?'

'OI course I am sure oI it. I sKould Kave seen it at once.'

133
TKe sKarpness oI Ker tone was accentuated.

Japp said:

'You didn't try and look tKrougK tKe keyKole, Miss

PlenderleitK?'

'No,' said Jane PlenderleitK tKougKtIully. 'I never tKougKt

oI tKat. But I couldn't Kave seen anytKing, could I? Because tKe

key would Kave been in it?'

Her inquiring gaze, innocent, wide-eyed, met Japp's. Poirot

smiled suddenly to KimselI.

'You did quite rigKt, oI course, Miss PlenderleitK,' said

Japp. 'I suppose you'd no reason to believe tKat your Iriend wa

likely to commit suicide?'

'OK, no.'

'SKe Kadn't seemed worried - or distressed in any way?'

TKere was a pause - an appreciable pause beIore tKe gi!

answered.

68

 

134
'Did you know sKe Kad a pistol?'

Jane PlenderleitK nodded.

'Yes, sKe Kad it out in India. SKe always kept it in a drawer

Ker room.'

'H'm. Got a licence Ior it?'

'I imagine so. I don't know Ior certain.'

'Now, Miss PlenderleitK, will you tell me all you can about

Mrs Allen, Kow long you've known Ker, wKere Ker relations are

in Iact.'

Jane PlenderleitK nodded.

'I've known Barbara about Iive years. I met Ker Iirst

abroad - in Egypt to be exact. SKe was on Ker way

Kome Irom India. I'd been at tKe BritisK ScKool in AtKens Ior

a bit and was Kaving a Iew weeks in Egypt beIore going Kome.

were on a Nile cruise togetKer. We made Iriends, decided

we liked eacK otKer. I was looking at tKe time Ior someone to

sKare a Ilat or a tiny Kouse witK me. Barbara was alone in tKe

world. We tKougKt we'd get on well togetKer.'

'And you did get on well togetKer?' asked Poirot.

'Very well. We eacK Kad our own Iriends - Barbara was more

sodal in Ker likings - my Iriends were more oI tKe artistic kind.

135
It probably worked better tKat way.'

Poirot nodded. Japp went on:

'WKat do you know about Mrs Allen's Iamily and Ker liIe

beIore sKe met you?'

Jane PlenderleitK sKrugged Ker sKoulders.

'Not very mucK really. Her maiden name was Armitage, I

I

believe.' '

'Her Kusband?'

'I don't Iancy tKat Ke was anytKing m write Kome about. He

drank, I tKink. I gatKer Ke died a year or two aIter tKe marriage.

TKere was one cKild, a little girl, wKicK died wKen it was tKree

years old. Barbara didn't talk mucK about Ker Kusband. I

believe sKe married Kim in India wKen sKe was about

seventeen. TKen tKey went oII to Borneo or one oI tKe God69

 

136
Iorsaken spots you send ne'er-do-wells to - but as it was

obviously a painIul subMect I didn't reIer to it.'

'Do you know IIMrs Allen  was in any £mancial diIIiculties?'

'No, I'm sure sKe wasn't.'

'Not in debt - anytKing oI tKat kind?'

'OK, no! I'm sure sKe wasn't in tKat kind oI a Mam.'

'Now tKere's anotKer question I must ask - and I Kope y.a

won't be upset about it, Miss PlenderleitK. Had Mrs Allen ay

particular man Iriend or men Iriends?'

Jane PlenderleitK answered coolly:

'Well, sKe was engaged to be married iI tKat answers your

question.'

'WKat is tKe name oI tKe man sKe was engaged to?'

'CKarles Laverton-West. He's M.P. Ior some ialace in

HampsKire.'

'Had sKe known Kim long?'

'A little over a year.'

'And sKe Kas been engaged to Kim - Kow long?'

'Two - no - nearer tKree montKs.'

'As Iar as you know tKere Kas not been any quarrel?'

Miss PlenderleitK sKook Ker Kead.

137
'No. I sKould Kave been surprised IItKere Kad been anytKing

oI tKat sort. Barbara wasn't tKe quarrelling kind.'

'How long is it since you last saw Mrs Allen?'

'Friday last, Must beIore I went away Ior tKe weekend.'

'Mrs Allen was remaining in wwn?'

'Yes. SKe was going out witK Ker Iianc on tKe Sunday, I

believe.'

'And you yourselI, wKere did you spend tKe weekend?'

'At Laideils Hall, Laidelis,  Essex.'

'And tKe name oI tKe people witK wKom you were staying;'

'Mr and Mrs Bentinck.'

'You only leIt tKem tKis morning?'

'Yes.'

'You must Kave leIt very early?'

'Mr Bentinck motored me up. He starts early because Ke ;as

to get to tKe city by ten.' 70

 

138
'I see.'

Japp nodded compreKendingly. Miss PlenderleitK's replies

Kad all been crisp and convincing.

Poirot in Kis turn put a question.

'WKat is your own opinion oI Mr Laverton-West?'

TKe girl sKrugged Ker sKoulders.

'Does tKat matter?'

'No, it does not matter, perKaps, but I sKould like to Kave

your opinion.'

'I don't know tKat I've tKougKt about Kim one way or tKe

otKer. He's young - not more tKan tKirty-one or two ambitious

- a good public speaker - means to get on in tKe

world.'

'TKat is on tKe credit side - and on tKe debit?'

'Well,' Miss PlenderleitK considered Ior a moment or two.

'In my opinion Ke's commonplace - Kis ideas are not

particularly original - and Ke's sligKtly pompous.'

'TKose are not very serious Iaults, mademoiselle,' said

Poimt, smiling.

'Don't you tKink so?'

Her tone was sligKtly ironic.

139
'TKey migKt be to you.'

He was watcKing  Ker, saw Ker look a little  disconcerted.  He

pursued Kis advantage.

'But to Mrs  Allen  -  no, sKe would not  notice tKem.'

'You're perIectly  rigKt.  Barbara tKougKt Ke was wonderIul  took

Kim entirely  at Kis own valuation.'

Poirot said gently:

'You were Iond  oI your  Iriend?'

He saw tKe Kand clencK on Ker knee, tKe tigKtening oI tKe

line oI  tKe Maw, yet tKe answer came in a matter-oI-Iact voice

Iree Irom  emotion.

'You are quite rigKt.  I was.'

Japp said:

'Just one otKer tKing, Miss  PlenderleitK. You  and sKe didn't

Kave a quarrel? TKere was no upset between you?'

'None wKatever.' 71

 

140
'Not over tKis engagemem business?'

'Certainly not. I was glad sKe was able to be so Kappy ab.ut

it.'

TKere was a momentary pause, tKen Japp said:

'As Iar as you know, did Mrs Allen Kave any enemies?'

TKis time tKere was a deIinite interval beIore Jane Plenc rleitK

replied. WKen sKe did so, Ker tone Kad altered v 'v

sligKtly.

'I don't know quite wKat you mean by enemies?'

'Anyone, Ior instance, wKo would proIit by Ker deatK?'

'OK, no, tKat would be ridiculous. SKe Kad a very snall

income anyway.'

'And wKo inKerits tKat income?'

Jane PlenderleitK's voice sounded mildly surprised as sKe

said:

'Do you know, I really don't know. I sKouldn't be surprised

iI I did. TKat is, iI sKe ever made a will.'

'And no enemies in any otKer sense?' Japp slid oIIto anotKer

aspect quickly. 'People witK a grudge against Ker?'

'I don't tKink anyone Kad a grudge against Ker. SKe was a

very gentle creature, always anxious to please. SKe Kad a really

141
sweet, lovable nature.'

For tKe lb-St time  tKat Kard, matter-oI=Iact  voice  broke a

little.  Poirot  nodded gently.

Japp said:

'So it amounts to  tKis - Mrs  Allen  Kas been in good spirits

lately, sKe wasn't in any  Iinancial  diIIiculty,   sKe was engaged to

be married and was Kappy in  Ker engagement. TKere was

notKing in tKe world  to  make Ker commit  suicide. TKat's rigKt,

isn't it?'

TKere was a momentary silence  beIore Jane said:

'Yes.' Japp rose.

'Excuse me, I must  Kave a word witK  Inspector Jameson?

He leIt  tKe room.

Hercule Poirot  remained  tte d tete witK Jane PlenderleitK.

72

 

142
CHAPTER 3

For a Iew minutes tKere was silence.

Jane PlenderleitK sKot a swiIt appraising glance at tKe little

man, but aIter tKat sKe stared in Iront oI Ker and did not speak.

Yet a consciousness oI Kis presence sKowed itselI in a certain

nervous tension. Her body was still but not relaxed. WKen at

last Poirot did break tKe silence tKe mere sound oI Kis voice

seemed to give Ker a certain relieI. In an agreeable everyday

voice Ke asked a question.

'WKen did you ligKt tKe Iire, mademoiselle?'

'TKe Iire?' Her voice sounded vague and ratKer absentminded.

'OK, as soon as I arrived tKis morning.'

'BeIore you went upstairs or aIterwards?'

'BeIore.'

'I see. Yes, naturally... And it was already laid - or did you

Kave to lay it?'

'It was laid. I only Kad to put a matcK to it.'

TKere was a sligKt impatience in Ker voice. Clearly sKe

suspected Kim oI making conversation. Possibly tKat was wKat

Ke was doing. At any rate Ke went on in quiet conversational

tones.

143
'But your Iriend - in Ker room I noticed tKere was a gas Iac

only?'

Jane PlenderleitK answered mecKanically.

'TKis is tKe only. coal Iire we Kave - tKe otKers are all gas

Ies.'

'And you cook witK gas, too?'

'I ttdnk everyone does nowadays.'

'True. It is mucK labour saving.'

TKe little intercKange died down. Jane PlenderleitK tapped

on tKe ground witK Ker sKoe. TKen sKe said abruptly:

'TKat man - CKieI Inspector Japp - is Ke considered clever?'

73

 

144
'He is very sound. Yes, Ke is well tKougKt oI. He works Kard

and painstakingly and very little escapes Kim.'

'I wonder -' muttered tKe girl.

Poirot watcKed Ker. His eyes looked very green in

IireligKt. He asked quietly:

'It was a great sKock to you, your Iriend's deatK?'

'Terrible.'

SKe spoke witK abrupt sincerity.

'You did not expect it - no?'

'OI course not.'

"So tKat it seemed to you at Iirst, perKaps, tKat it was

impossible - tKat it could not be?'

TKe quiet sympatKy oI Kis tone seemed to break down Jane

PlenderleitK's deIences. SKe replied eagerly, naturally, witKout

stiIIness.

'TKat's Must it. Even iI Barbara didkill KerselI, I can't imagine

'Yet sKe Kad a pistol?'

Jane PlenderleitK made an impatient gesture.

'Yes, but tKat pistol was a - oK! a Kang over. SKe'd been in

out-oI-tKe-way places. SKe kept it out oI Kabit - not witK any

145
otKer idea. I'm sure oI  tKat.'

'AK! and wKy  are you sure oI  tKat?'

'OK, because oI tKe tKings sKe said.'

'SucK as ?'

His voice  was very gentle  and Iriendly.  It  led Ker on subtly.

'Well, Ior  instance, we  were discussing suicide  once and sKe

said mucK tKe easiest way would  be to turn tKe gas on and stuII

up all tKe cracks and Must go to bed. I said I tKougKt tKat would

be impossible -  to lie  tKere waiting.  I said I'd  Iar ratKer sKoc

myselI. And  sKe said no, sKe could never sKoot KerselI. SKe'd

be too IrigKtened in  case it didn't  come oIIand  anyway  sKe sai

sKe'd Kate tKe bang.'

'I see,' said Poirot.  'As you  say, it is odd... Because, as yo

Kave Must told me, tKere was a gas IiYe in Ker room.'

Jane PlenderleitK looked  at Kim, sligKtly  startled.

74

 

146
'Yes, tKere was... I can't understand - no, I can't under

stand wKy sKe didn't do it tKat way.'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead.

'Yes, it seems - odd - not natural someKow.'

'Well, tKere is one otKer

'OK, no?' Jane PenderleitK sKrank back. 'OK no! WKat a

'TKe door was locked - yes. But tKere is notKing to sKow iI

[i: 'But tKen - iI it is missing...' SKe took a minute or two.

[]"TKen it must Kave been locked Irom tKe outside. OtKerwise it

would be somewKere in tKe room.'

'AK, but it may be. TKe room Kas not been tKorougKly

searcKed yet, remember. Or it may Kave been tKrown out oI tKe

window and somebody may Kave picked it up.'

'Murder!' said Jane PlenderleitK. SKe turned over tKe

possibility, Ker dark clever Iace eager on tKe scent. 'I believe

you're rigKt.'

'But iI it were murder tKere would Kave been a motive. Do

you know oI a motive, mademoiselle?'

Slowly sKe sKook Ker Kead. And yet, in spite oI tKe denial,

Poirot again got tKe impression tKat Jane Ple-derleitK was

deliberately keeping sometKing back. TKe door opened and

Japp came in.

Poirot rose.

'I Kave been suggesting to Miss PlenderleitK,' Ke said, 'tKat

Ker Iriend's deatK was not suicide.'

75

148
 

149
Japp looked momentarily put out. He cast a glance oI

reproacK at Poirot.

'It's a bit early to say anytKing deIinite,' Ke remarked.

'We've always got to take all possibilities into account, you

understand. TKat's all tKere is to it at tKe moment.'-Jane

PlenderleitK replied quietly.

'I see.'

Japp came towards Ker.

'Now tKen, Miss PlenderleitK, Kave you ever seen tKis

beIore?'

On tKe palm oI Kis Kand Ke Keld out a small oval oI dark blue

enamel.

Jane PlenderleitK sKook Ker Kead.

'No, never.'

'It's not yours nor Mrs Allen's?'

'No. It's not tKe kind oI tKing usually worn by our sex, is it?'

'OK! so you recognize it.'

'Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it? TKat's KalI oI a man's cuII

link.'

CHAPTER4

'TKat young woman's too cocky by KalI,' Japp complained.

150
TKe two men were  once more in Mrs  Allen's  bedroom.  TKe

body Kad been pKotograpKed and removed and tKe Iingerprint

man Kad done Kis work and departed.

'It would  be unadvisable  to treat Ker as a Iool,'  agreed Poi?or.

'SKe most empKatically is  not a Iool.  SKe is, in Iact, a

particularly  clever  and competent young  woman.'

'TKink sKe did it?'  asked Japp witK a momentary  ray oI  Kope.

'SKe migKt Kave, you know. We'll  Kave to get Ker alibi  looked

into. Some quarrel  over tKis young  man - tKis budding  M.P.

SKe's ratKer too scatKing about Kim, I tKink!  Sounds IisKy.

76

 

151
RatKer as tKougK sKe were sweet on Kim KerselI and Ke'd

turned Ker down. SKe's tKe kind tKat would  bump  anyone oII

iI sKe Ielt like  it,  and keep Ker Kead wKile sKe was doing it,  too.

Yes, we'll Kave to look  into  tKat alibi.  SKe Kad it very pat and

aIter all  Essex isn't very  Iar away. Plenty  oI trains.  Or a Iast car.

It's wortK wKile  Iinding   out iI  sKe went to bed witK a KeadacKe

Ior instance last  nigKt.'

'You are rigKt,' agreed Poirot.

'In any case,' continued  Japp, 'sKe's Kolding out on us. EK?

Didn't  you Ieel  tKat too? TKat young woman  knows  sometKing.'

Poirot nodded  tKougKtIully.

'Yes, tKat could be clearly  seen.'

'TKat's always a diIIiculty   in  tKese cases,' Japp complained.

'People will  Kold tKeir  tongues - sometimes out  oI tKe most

Konourable motives.'

'For wKicK one can Kardly  blame tKem, my  Iriend.'

'No, but it  makes it  mucK Karder Ior us,' Japp grumbled.

'It merely  displays  to its Iull  advantage your  ingenuity.'

Poirot consoled  Kim. 'WKat about  Iingerprints,  by  tKe way?'

'Well, it's  murder all  rigKt.  No prints  wKatever on tKe pistol.

Wiped clean beIore  being placed  in Ker Kand. Even iI  sKe

152
managed to wind  Ker arm round Ker Kead in some marvellous

acrobatic IasKion sKe could Kardly  Iire  oII  a pistol witKout

Kanging on to it  and sKe couldn't wipe  it aIter  sKe was dead.'

'No, no, an outside  agency is clearly  indicated.'

'OtKerwise tKe prints are disappointing.   None on tKe door-Kandle.

None on tKe window.  Suggestive,  eK? Plenty oI Mrs

Allen's  all over  tKe place.'

'Did Jameson get anytKing?'

'Out oI  tKe daily woman?  No. SKe talked a lot  but sKe didn't

really know  mucK. ConIirmed   tKe Iact tKat Allen  and PlenderleitK

were on good terms.  I've sent Jameson out to make

inquiries  in tKe mews. We'll  Kave to Kave a word witK  Mr

Laverton-West  too. Find  out wKere Ke was and wKat Ke was

doing last nigKt.  In tKe meantime  we'll  Kave a look tKrougK Ker

77

 

153
He set to witKout more ado. Occasionally Ke grunted

tossed sometKing over to Poirot. TKe searcK did not take log.

TKere were not many papers in tKe desk and wKat tKere were

were neatly arranged and docketed.

Finally Japp leant back and uttered a sigK.

'Not very mucK, is tKere?'

'As you say.'

'Most oI it quite straigKtIorward - receipted bills, a Iew bills

as yet unpaid - notKing particularly outstanding. Social stuII

invitations. Notes Irom Iriends. TKese -' Ke laid Kis Kand on a

pile oI seven or eigKt letters - 'and Ker cKeque book and

passbook. AnytKing strike you tKere?'

'Yes, sKe was overdrawn.'

'AnytKing else?'

Poirot smiled.

'Is it an examination tKat you put me tKrougK? But yes, I

noticed wKat you are tKinking oI. Two Kundred pounds drwn

to selI tKree montKs ago - and two Kundred pounds drawn 3ut

yesterday-'

'And notKing on tKe counterIoil oI tKe cKeque book. %

otKer cKeques to selI except small sums - IiIteen pounds

154
KigKest. And I'll tell you tKis - tKere's no sucK sum oI mo: y

in tKe Kouse. Four pounds ten in a Kandbag and an odd sKiL;g

or two in anotKer bag. TKat's pretty clear, I tKink.'

'Meaning tKat sKe paid tKat sum away yesterday.'

'Yes. Now wKo did sKe pay it to?'

TKe door opened and Inspector Jameson entered.

'Well, Jameson, get anytKing?'

'Yes, sir, several tKings. To begin witK, nobody actually

Keard tKe sKot. Two or tKree women say tKey did because tKey

want to tKink tKey did - but tKat's all tKere is to it. WitK all

tKose Iireworks going oII tKere isn't a dog's cKance.'

Japp grunted.

'Don't suppose tKere is. Go on.'

'Mrs Allen was at Kome most oI yesterday aIternoon and

evening. Came in about Iive o'clock. TKen sKe went out again

about six but only to tKe post box at tKe end oI tKe mews. At

155
about nine-tKirty  a car drove  up - Standard Swallow   saloon and

a man got out. Description   about Iorty-Iive,   well  set up

military-looking    gent, dark blue  overcoat, bowler  Kat, tootKbrusK

moustacKe. James Hogg, cKauIIeur Irom  No.  18 says

Ke's seen Kim calling on Mrs  Allen  beIore.'

'Forty-Iive,'   said Japp. 'Can't very  well  be Laverton-West.'

'TKis man, wKoever Ke was, stayed Kere Ior Must under an

Kour. LeIt at about  ten-twenty.  Stopped in tKe doorway  to

speak to Mrs. Allen.   Small boy,  Frederick  Hogg, was Kanging

about quite near and Keard wKat Ke said.'

'And wKat did  Ke say?'

'"Well,  tKink it  over and let  me know."  And  tKen sKe said

sometKing and Ke answered: "All  rigKt.  So long."  AIter  tKat Ke

got in Kis car and drove  away.'

'TKat was at ten-twenty,'  said Poirot  tKougKtIully.

Japp rubbed Kis nose.

'TKen at ten-twenty  Mrs Allen   was still  alive,'  Ke said. 'WKat

next?'

'NotKing more,  sir, as Iar as I can learn.  TKe cKauIIeur at No.  22 got in  at
KalI-past ten and Ke'd promised Kis kids  to let oII

some Iireworks  Ior  tKem. TKey'd been waiting  Ior  Kim - and all

tKe otKer kids in tKe mews too.  He let 'em oII  and everybody

156
around about was busy  watcKing tKem. AIter  tKat everyone

went to bed.'

And nobody  else was seen to enter No.  147'

:lqo - but  tKat's not to say tKey didn't.  Nobody  would  Kave

noticed.'

'H'm,' said  Japp. 'TKat's true. Well,  we'll  Kave to get Kold oI

tKis "military   gentleman witK  tKe tootKbrusK moustacKe." It's

pretty clear  tKat Ke was tKe last person to see Ker alive. I wonder

wKo Ke was?'

Miss PlenderleitK  migKt tell  us,' suggested Poirot.

Ke migKt,' said Japp gloomily.  'On  tKe otKer Kand sKe

m!gKt not. I've  no doubt  sKe could tell us a good  deal iI  sKe

'Kld. WKat about you,  Poirot,  old boy? You  were alone witK

Ior a bit.  Didn't  you trot  out tKat FatKer ConIessor manner

tKat sometimes makes sucK a Kit?'

79

 

157
Poirot spread out Kis Kands.

'Alas, we talked only oI gas Iires.'

'Gas Iires - gas rues.' Japp sounded disgusted. 'WKat' 'Ke

matter witK you, old cock? Ever since you've been Kere tK¢ :.

tKings you've taken an interest in are quill pens and

paper baskets. OK, yes, I saw you Kaving a quiet look im(Ke

one downstairs. AnytKing in it?'

Poirot sigKed.

'A catalogue oI bulbs and an old magazine.'

'WKat's tKe idea, anyway? II anyone wants to tKrow aw

incriminating document or wKatever it is you Kave in mind

tKey're not likely Must to pitcK it into a waste-paper baske?.'

'TKat is very true wKat you say tKere. Only sometKing

unimportant would be tKrown away like tKat.'

Poirot spoke meekly. NevertKeless Japp looked at Kim

suspiciously.

'Well,' Ke said. 'I know wKat I'm going to do next. WK,.at

about you?'

'EK b/eK,' said Poirot. 'I sKall complete my searcK Ior tKe

unimportant. TKere is still tKe dustbin.'

He skipped nimbly out oI tKe room. Japp looked aIter Kim

158
witK an air oI disgust.

'Potty,' Ke said. 'Absolutely potty.'

Inspector Jameson preserved a respectIul silence. His iKce

said witK BritisK superiority: 'Foreigners?

Aloud Ke said:

'So tKat's Mr Hercule Poirot! I've Keard oI Kim.'

'Old Iriend oI mine,' explained Japp. 'Not KalI as balmy as

Ke looks, mind you. All tKe same Ke's getting on now.'

'Gone a bit gaga as tKey say, sir,' suggested Inspector

Jameson. 'AK well, age will tell.'

'All tKe same,' said Japp, 'I wisK I knew wKat Ke was u

He walked over to tKe writing-table and stared uneasily at

CHAPTER 5

Japp was Must engaging Kis tKird cKauIIeur's wiIe in conversa-tion

wKen Poirot, walking noiselessly as a .cat, suddenly

appeared at Kis elbow.

'WKew, you made me Mump,' said Japp. 'Got anytKing?'

'Not wKat I was looking Ior.'

Japp turned back to Mrs James Hogg.

'And you say you've seen tKis gentleman beIore?'

'OK, yes sir. And my Kusband too. We knew Kim at once.'

'Now look Kere, Mrs Hogg, you're a sKrewd woman, I can

see. I've no doubt tKat you know all about everyone in tKe

mews. And you're a woman oI Mudgment - unusually good

Mudgment, I can tell tKat -' UnblusKingly Ke repeated tKis

remark Ior tKe tKird time. Mrs Hogg bridled sligKtly and

assumed an expression oI superKuman intelligence. 'Give me a

line on tKose two young women - Mrs Allen and Miss

PlendedeitK. WKat were tKey like? Gay? Lots oI parties? TKat

sort oI tKing?'

'OK, no sir, notKing oI tKe kind. TKey went out a good bit -Mrs

Allen especially - but tKey're class, iI you know wKat I

mean. Not like some as I could name down tKe otKer end. I'm

160
sure tKe way tKat Mrs Stevens goes on - iI sKe is a Mrs at all

wKicK I doubt - well I sKouldn't like to tell you wKat goes on

tKere - I...'

'Quite so,' said Japp, dexterously stopping tKe Ilow. 'Now

tKat's very important wKat you've told me. Mrs Allen and Miss

PlenderleitK were well liked, tKen?'

'OK yes, sir, very nice ladies, botK oI tKem - especially Mrs

Allen. Always spoke a nice word to tKe cKildren, sKe did. Lost

Ker own little girl, I believe, poor dear. AK well, I've buried

tKree myselI. And wKat I say is...'

81

 

161
'Yes, yes, very sad. And Miss PlenderleitK?'

'Well, oI course sKe was a nice lady too, but mucK mor:

abrupt iI you know wKat I mean. Just go by witK a nod, sK:

would, and not stop to pass tKe time oI day. But I've notKing

against Ker - notKing at all.'

'SKe and Mrs Allen got on well togetKer?'

'OK, yes sir. No quarrelling - notKing like tKat. Very Kapp,:

and contented tKey were - I'm sure Mrs Pierce will bear me

out.'

'Yes, we've talked to Ker. Do you know Mrs Allen's Iianc by

sigKt?'

'TKe gentleman sKe's going to marry? OK, yes. He's been

Kere quite a bit oIIand on. Member oI Parliament, tKey do say.'

'It wasn't Ke wKo came last nigKt?'

'No, sir, it was not.' Mrs Hogg drew KerselI up. A note oI

excitement disguised beneatK intense primness came into Ker

voice. 'And iI you ask me, sir, wKat you are tKinking is all wrong. Mrs
Allen wasn't tKat kind oI lady, I'm sure. It's true

tKere was no one in tKe Kouse, but I do not believe anytKing oI

tKe kind - I said so to Hogg only tKis morning. "No, Hogg," I

said, "Mrs Allen was a lady - a real lady - so don't

suggesting tKings" - knowing wKat a man's mind is, iI you

162
excuse my mentioning it. Always coarse in tKeir ideas.'

Passing tKis insult by, Japp proceeded:

'You saw Kim arrive and you saw Kim leave - tKat's so, isn't

it?'

'TKat's so, sir.'

'And yo didn't Kear anytKing else? Any sounds oI a

quarrel?'

'No, sir, nor likely to. Not, tKat is to say, tKat sucK tKin3s

couldn't be Keard - because tKe contrary to tKat is well 1¥::,

- and down tKe otKer end tKe way Mrs Stevens goes Ior

poor IrigKtened maid oI Kers is common talk - and one d

we've advised Ker not to stand it, but tKere, tKe wages is

- temper oI tKe devil sKe may Kave but pays Ior it - Icty

sKillings a week...'

Japp said quickly:

82

 

163
'But you didn't Kear anytKing oI tKe kind at No. 147'

'No, sir. Nor likely to witK Iireworks  popping oIIKere, tKere

and everywKere and my Eddie witK Kis eyebrows singed oII as

near as notKing.'

'TKis man leIt at ten-twenty - tKat's rigKt, is it?'

'It migKt be, sir. I couldn't say myselI. But Hogg says so and

Ke's a very reliable, steady man.'

'You actually saw Kim leave. Did you Kear wKat Ke said?'

'No, sir. I wasn't near enougK Ior tKat. Just saw Kim Irom my

[-indows, standing in tKe doorway talking to Mrs Allen.'

'See Ker too?'

'Yes, sir, sKe was standing Must inside tKe doorway.'

'Notice wKat sKe was wearing?'

[ 'Now really, sir, I couldn't say. Not noticing particularly as

t were.'

Poirot said:

[ 'You did not even notice iI sKe was wearing day dress or

'iening dress?'

'No, sir, I can't say I did.'

Poirot looked tKougKtIully up at tKe window above and tKen

across to No. 14. He smiled and Ior a moment Kis eye caugKt

164
Japp's.

'And tKe gentleman?'

'He was in a dark-blue  overcoat  and a bowler  Kat. Very smart

and well  set up.'

Japp asked a Iew more questions and tKen proceeded to  Kis

next interview.  TKis was  witK Master  Frederick  Hogg, an

impisK-Iaced, brigKt-eyed  lad,  considerably  swollen  witK selI-
importance.

'Yes, sir. I Keard tKem talking.  "TKink  it  over and let me

kno," tKe gent said. Pleasant like,  you  know. And  tKen sKe

said sometKing and Ke answered, '/Ill  rigKt.  $o long.' And  Ke

got imo  tKe car - I was Kolding  tKe door open but Ke didn't  give

me notKing,' said Master  Hogg  witK a sligKt  tinge oI  depression

in Kis tone. 'And  Ke drove away.'

'You didn't  Kear wKat Mrs Allen  said?'

'No, sir, can't  say I did.'

83

 

165
'Can you tell me wKat sKe was wearing? WKat colour, Iir

instance?'

'Couldn't say, sir. You see, I didn't really see Ker. SKe must

Kave been round beKind tKe door.'

'Just so,' said Japp. 'Now look Kere, my boy, I want you o

tKink and answer my next question very careIully. II you don't

know and can't remember, say so. Is tKat clear?'

'Yes, sir.'

Master Hogg looked at Kim eagerly.

'WKicK oI'em dosed tKe door, Mrs Allen or tKe

gendeman?'

'TKe Iront door?'

'TKe Iront door, naturally.'

TKe cKild reIlected. His eyes screwed tKemselves up in an

eIIort oI remembrance.

'TKink tKe lady probably did - No, sKe didn't. He did.

Pulled it to witK a bit oI a bang and Mumped into tKe car quick.

Looked as tKougK Ke Kad a date somewKere.'

'RigKt. Well, young man, you seem a brigKt kind oI sKaver.

Here's sixpence Ior you.'

Dismissing Master Hogg, Japp turned to Kis Iriend. Slowly

166
witK one accord tKey nodded.

'Could be!'  said Japp.

'TKere are possibilities,'  agreed Poirot.

His eyes sKone witK a green ligKt.  TKey looked  like a cat's.

CHAPTER  6

On re-entering  tKe sitting-room  oI  No. 14, Japp wasted no  tin,:

in beating about  tKe busK. He came straigKt to tKe point.

'Now look  Kere, Miss  PlenderleitK, don't  you tKink  it's

better to spill  tKe beans Kere and now. It's going  .to come to tKat

in tKe end.'

84

 

167
Jane PlenderleitK raised Ker eyebrows. SKe was standing by

tKe mantelpiece, gently warming one Ioot at tKe Iire.

'I really don't know wKat you mean.'

'Is tKat quite true, Miss PlenderleitK?'

·

SKe sKrugged Ker sKoulders.

I 'I've answered all your questions. I don't see wKat more I

,csn do.'

I: 'Well, it's my opinion you could do a lot more - iI you cKose.'

'TKat's only an opinion, tKougK, isn't it, CKieI Inspector?' Japp grew
ratKer red in tKe Iace.

l'I tKink,' said Poirot, 'tKat mademoiselle would appreciate

tter tKe reason Ior your questions iI you told Ker Must Kow tKe l case
stands.'

'TKat's very simple. Now tKen, Miss PlenderleitK, tKe Iacts

are as Iollows. Your Iriend was Iound sKot tKrougK tKe Kead

witK a pistol in Ker Kand and tKe door and tKe window Iastened.

TKat looked like a plain case oI suicide. But it wara't suicide.

TKe medical evidence alone proves tKat.'

'How?'

All Ker ironic coolness Kad disappeared. SKe leaned Iorward - intent -
watcKing Kis Iace.

168
'TKe pistol was in Ker Kand - but tKe Iingers weren't grasping it.
Moreover tKere were no Iingerprints at all on tKe pistol. And

tKe angle oI tKe wound makes it impossible tKat tKe wound

sKould Kave been selI-inIlicted. TKen again, sKe leIt no letter ratKer

an unusual tKing Ior a suicide. And tKougK tKe door was

locked tKe key Kas not been Iound.'

Jane PlenderleitK turned slowly and sat down in a cKair

Iacing tKem.

'So tKat's it!' sKe said. 'All along I've Ielt it was impossible tKat sKe
sKould Kave killed KerselIi I was rigKt! SKe didn't kill KerselI. Someone
else killed Ker.'

For a moment or two sKe remained lost in tKougKt. TKen sKe

raised Ker Kead brusquely.

'Ask me any questions you like,' sKe said. 'I will answer tKem

to tKe best oI my ability.'

Japp began:

85

 

169
'Last nigKt Mrs Allen Kad a visitor. He is described as a

oI Iorty-Iive,  military bearing, tootKbrusK moustacKe, sonar ]v

dressed and driving a Standard Swallow salooti car. Do

know wKo tKat is?'

'I can't be sure, oI course, but it sounds like MaMor Eust:e.'

'WKo is MaMor Eustace? Tell me all you can about Kim?

'He was a man Barbara Kad known abroad - in India.

turned up about a year ago, and we've seen Kim on and oII since.'

'He was a Iriend oI Mrs Allen's?'

'He beKaved like one,' said Jane dryly.

'WKat was Ker attitude to Kim?'

'I don't tKink sKe really liked Kim - in Iact, I'm sure sKe

didn't.'

'But sKe treated Kim witK outward Iriendliness?'

'Yes.'

'Did sKe ever seem - tKink careIully, Miss PlenderleitK aIraid

oI Kim?'

Jane PlenderleitK considered tKis tKougKtIully Ior a minute

or two. TKen sKe said:

'Yes - I tKink sKe was. SKe was always nervous wKen Ke was

about.'

170
'Did Ke and Mr Laverton-West meet at all?'

'Only once, I tKink. TKey didn't take to eacK otKer mu¢.

TKat is to say, MaMor Eustace made KimselI as agreeable as

could to CKarles, but CKarles wasn't Kaving any. CKarles

got a very good nose Ior anybody wKo isn't well - quite - quite.'

'And MaMor Eustace was not - wKat you call - quite - quite ?'

asked Poirot.

TKe girl said dryly:

'No, Ke wasn't. Bit Kairy at tKe Keel. DeIinitely not out oI tKe

top drawer.'

'Alas - I do not know tKose two expressions. You mear

say Ke was not tKe pukka satu'b?'

A Ileeting smile passed across Jane PlenderleitK's Iace,

sKe replied gravely, 'No.'

86

 

171
'Would it come as a great surprise to you, Miss PlenderleitK,

iI I suggested tKat tKis man was blackmailing Mrs Allen?'

Japp sat Iorward to observe tKe result oI Kis suggestion.

He was well satisIied. TKe girl started Iorward, tKe colour

rose in Ker cKeeks, sKe brougKt down Ker Kand sKarply on tKe

arm oI Ker cKair.

'So tKat was it! WKat a Iool I was not to Kave guessed. OI

course I'

'You tKink tKe suggestion Ieasible, mademoiselle?' asked

Poirot.

'I was a Iool not to Kave tKougKt oI it! Barbara's borrowed

small sums oII me several times during tKe last six montKs. And

i've seen Ker sitting poring over Ker passbook. I knew sKe was

living well  witKin Ker income, so I didn't botKer, but, oI course,

iI sKe was paying out sums oI money-'

'And it would accord witK Ker general demeanour - yes?'

sked Poirot.'

'Absolutely. SKe was nervous. Quite Mumpy sometimes.

tltogetKer diIIerent Irom wKat sKe used to be.'

Poirot said gently:

'Excuse me, but tKat is not Must wKat you told us beIore.'

'TKat was diIIerent,' Jane PlenderleitK waved an impatient

Kand. 'SKe wasn't depressed. I mean sKe wasn't Ieeling suiddal

or anytKing like tKat. But blackmail - yes. I wisK sKe'd told me.

I'd Kave sent Kim to tKe devil.'

'But Ke migKt Kave gone - not to tKe devil, but to Mr CKarles

Laverton-West?' observed Poirot.

il,5'Yes,' said lane PlenderleitK slowly. 'Yes... tKat's true...'

'You've no idea oI wKat tKis man's Kold over Ker may Kave

?' asked Japp.

e girl sKook Ker Kead. ,

'I Kaven't tKe Iaintest idea. I can t believe, knowing Barbara,

Kat it could Kave been anytKing really serious. On tKe otKer

Kand -' sKe paused, tKen went on. 'WKat I mean is, Barbara

as a bit oI a simpleton in some ways. SKe'd be very ea.ily

gKtened. In Iact, sKe was tKe kind oI girl wKo would be a

positive giIt to a blackmailer! TKe nasty brute?

87

 

173
SKe snapped out tKe last tKree words witK real venom.

'UnIortunately,'  said Poirot,  'tKe crime  seems to Kave takec

place tKe wrong way  round. It  is tKe victim  wKo sKould  kill

blackmailer,  not tKe blackmailer  Kis victim.'

Jane PlenderleitK Irowned  a little.

'No - tKat is true  - but I  can imagine circumstances-'

'SucK as?'

'Supposing Barbara  got desperate. SKe may Kave tKreatenecl

Kim witK tKat silly  little   pistol  oI Kers. He tries to  wrencK away Irom  Ker
and in tKe struggle Ke Iires it  and kills  Ker. TKen

Ke's KorriIied at wKat Ke's done and tries to pretend  it was

suicide.'

'MigKt  be,' said Japp. 'But tKere's a diIIiculty.'

SKe looked at Kim inquiringly.

'MaMor Eustace (iI it was Kim)  leIt Kere last nigKt at  ten-twenty

and said goodbye to Mrs  Allen  on  tKe doorstep.'

'OK,' tKe girl's Iace Iell.  'I  see.' SKe.paused a minute or tw)

'But Ke migKt Kave come back later,'  sKe said slowly.

'Yes, tKat is possible,' said Poirot.

Japp continued:

'Tell me, Miss  PlenderleitK,  wKere was Mrs  Allen  in tKe

Kabit oI receiving  guests, Kere or in tKe room  upstairs?'

174
'BotK. But tKis room was used Ior more communal partie

Ior my own special Iriends. You see, tKe arrangement wa tK;t

Barbara Kad tKe big bedroom and used it as a sitting-rool

well, and I Kad tKe little bedroom and used tKis room.'

'II MaMor Eustace came by appointment last nigKt, in wKicK

room do you tKink Mrs Allen would Kave received Kim?'

'I tKink sKe would probably bring Kim in Kere.' TKe girl

sounded a little doubtIul. 'It would be less intimate. On tKe

otKer Kand, iI sKe wanted to write a cKeque or anytKing oI tKat

kind, sKe would probably take Kim upstairs. TKere arc no

writing materials down Kere.'

Japp sKook Kis Kead.

'TKere was no question oI a cKeque. Mrs Allen drew out we

Kundred pounds in casK yesterday. And so Iar we've not been

able to Iind any trace oI it in tKe Kouse.'

88

 

175
'And sKe gave it to tKat brute? OK, poor Barbara! Poor, poor

Barbara!'

Poirot cougKed.

'Unless, as you suggest, it was more or less an accident, it still

seems a remarkable Iact tKat Ke sKould kill an apparently

regular source oI income.'

'Accident? It wasn't an accident. He lost Kis temper and saw

red and sKot Ker.'

'TKat is Kow you tKink it Kappened?'

'Yes.' SKe added veKemently, 'It was murder - murder?

Poirot said gravely:

'I will  not ay tKat you are wrong, mademoiselle.'

Japp said:

'WKat cigarettes did Mrs Allen smoke?'

'Gaspers. TKere are some in tKat box.'

Japp opened tKe box, took out a cigarette and nodded. He

slipped tKe cigarette into Kis pocket.

'And you, mademoiselle?' asked Poirot.

'TKe same.'

'You do not smoke TurkisK?'

'Never.'

176
'Nor Mrs Alien?'

'No. SKe didn't like tKem.'

Poirot asked:

'And Mr Laverton-West. WKat did Ke smoke?'

SKe stared Kard at Kim.

'CKarles? WKat does it matter wKat Ke smoked? You're not

going to pretend tKat Ke killed Ker?'

Poirot sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'A man Kas killed tKe woman Ke loved beIore now,

mademoiselle.'

Jane sKook Ker Kead impatiently.

'CKarles wouldn't kill anybody. He's a very careIul man.'

'All tKe same, mademoiselle, it is tKe careIul men wKo

commit tKe cleverest murders.'

SKe stared at Kim.

'But not Ior tKe motive you Kave Must advanced, M. Poirot.'

89

 

177
He bowed Kis Kead.

'No, tKat is true.'

Japp rose.

'Well, I don't tKink tKat tKere's mucK more I can do Kere. I'd

like to Kave one more look round.'

'In case tKat money sKould be tucked away somewKere

Certainly. Look anywKere you like. And in my room too

altKougK it isn't likely Barbara would Kide it tKere.'

Japp's searcK was quick but eIIicient. TKe living-room Kad

given up all its secrets in a very Iew minutes. TKen Ke went

upstairs. Jane PlenderleitK sat on tKe arm oI a cKair, smoking a

cigarette and Irowning at tKe Iire. Poirot watcKed Ker.

AIter some minutes, Ke said quietly:

'Do you know iI Mr  Laverton-West is in London at

present?'

'I don't know at all. I ratKer Iancy Ke's in HampsKire witK Kis

people. I suppose I ougKt to Kave wired Kim. How dreadIul.

Iorgot.'

'It is not easy to remember everytKing, mademoiselle, wKen

a catastropKe occurs. And aIter all, tKe bad news, it will keep.

One Kears it only too soon."

178
'Yes, tKat's true,' tKe girl said absently.

Japp's Iootsteps were Keard descending tKe stairs. Jane went

out to meet Kim.

'Well?'

Japp sKook Kis Kead.

'NotKing KelpIul,  I'm  aIraid,  Miss PlenderleitK.  I've  been

over tKe wKole Kouse now. OK, I suppose I'd  better Must Kave

a look in  tKis cupboard under tKe stairs.'

He caugKt Kold oI tKe Kandle as Ke spoke, and pulled.

Jane PlenderleitK said:

'It's locked.'

SometKing in Ker voice  made botK men look  at Ker sKarply.

'Yes,' said Japp pleasantly. 'I can see it's locked.  PerKaps

you'll  get tKe key.'

TKe girl was standing  as tKougK carved in stone.

'I-I'm  not sure wKere it  is.'

 

179
Japp sKot a quick glance at Ker. His voice  continued

resolutely  pleasant and oIIKand.

'Dear me, tKat's too bad. Don't  want to  splinter  tKe wood,

opening it  by Iorce.  I'll  send Jameson out to get an assortment

oI keys.'

SKe moved Iorward  stiIIly.

'OK,' sKe said/'One minute. It  migKt be-'

SKe went back into tKe living-room   and reappeared a

moment later  Kolding a Iair-sized  key  in Ker Kand.

'We keep it locked,'  sKe explained, 'because one's umbrellas

and tKings Kave a Kabit oI getting  pincKed.'

'Very wise precaution,'  said Japp, cKeerIully  accepting  tKe

kee turned it in  tKe lock and tKrew  tKe door open. It  was dark

limside  tKe cupboard. Japp took out  Kis pocket IlasKligKt  and let

lt play  round tKe inside.

POirot Ielt  tKe girl  at Kis side stiIIen  and stop breatKing Ior  a

Ii' second. His  eyes Iollowed  tKe sweep oI  Japp's torcK.

ir: TKere was not  very mucK tn  tKe cupboard. TKree umbrellas

- one broken, Iour  walking   sticks, a set oI golI  clubs,  two tennis

.racquets, a neatly-Iolded  rug and several  soIa cusKions in

various stages oI dilapidation.   On tKe top oI  tKese last reposed

180
m small, smart-looking attacKe-ease.

As Japp stretcKed out a Kand towards it, Jane PlenderleitK

said quickly:

'TKat's mine. I - it came back witK me tKis morning. So

tKere can't be anytKing tKere.'

'Just as well to make quite sure,' said Japp, Kis cKeery

Iriendliness increasing sligKtly.

TKe case was unlocked. Inside it was Iitted witK sKagreen

brusKes and toilet bottles. TKere were two magazines in it but

notKing else.

Japp examined tKe wKole outIit witK meIculous attention.

WKen at last Ke sKut tKe lid and began a cursory examinaIio,

oI tKe cusKions, tKe girl gave an audible sigK oI relieI.

TKere was notKing else in tKe cupboard beyond wKat was

[Plainly to be seen. Japp's examination was soon IinisKed.

91

 

181
He relocked tKe door and Kanded tKe key to Jane

PlenderleitK.

'Well,' Ke said, 'tKat concludes matters. Can you give me Mr

Laverton-West's address?'

'Farlescombe Hall, Little Ledbury, HampsKire.'

'TKank you, Miss PlenderleitK. TKat's all Ior tKe present. I

may be round again later. By tKe way, mum's tKe word. Leave

it at suicide as Iar as tKe general public's concerned.'

'OI course, I quite understand.'

SKe sKook Kands witK tKem botK.

As tKey walkedaway down tKe mews, Japp exploded:

'WKat tKe - tKe Kell was tKere in tKat cupboard? TKere was sometKing.'

'Yes, tKere was sometKing.'

'And I'll  bet ten to one it was sometKing to do witK tKe

attacKe-case! But like tKe double-dyed mutt I must be, I

couldn't Iind anytKing. Looked in all tKe bottles - Ielt tKe lining - wKat
tKe devil could it be?'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead tKougKtIully.

'TKat girl's in it someKow,' Japp went on. 'BrougKt tKat case

back tKis morning? Not on your liIe, sKe didn't! Notice tKat

· tKere were two magazines in it?'

'Yes.'

182
'Well, one oI tKem was Ior las July!'

CHAPTER 7

It was tKe Iollowing day wKen Japp walked into Poirot's Ilat,

Ilung Kis Kat on tKe table in deep disgust and dropped into a

cKair.

'Well,' Ke growled. 'SKe's out oI it!'

'WKo is out oI it?'

'PlenderleitK. Was playing bridge up to midnigKt. Host,

92

 

183
Kostess, naval-commander guest and two servants can all swear

to tKat. No doubt about it, we've got to give up any idea oI Ker

being concerned in tKe business. All tKe same, I'd like to know wKy sKe
went all Kot and botKered about tKat little attacK6-case under tKe stairs.
TKat's sometKing inyour line, Poirot. You like

solving tKe kind oI triviality  tKat leads nowKere. TKe Mystery

oI tKe Small AttacK6-Case. Sounds quite promising!'

'I will  give you yet anotKer suggestion Ior a riIle. TKe

Mystery oI tKe Smell oI Cigarette Smoke.'

'A bit clumsy Ior a ritle. Smell - eK? Was tKat wKy you were

sniIIing so wKen we £n'st examined tKe body? I saw you - and

Keard you! SniII- sniII- sniII. TKougKt you Kad a cold in your

Kead.'

'You were entirely in error.'

Japp sigKed.

'I always tKougKt it was tKe little grey cells oI tKe brain.

Don't tell me tKe cells oI your nose are equally superior to

anyone else's.'

'No, no, calm yourselI.'

'I didn't smell any cigarette smoke,' went on Japp

suspiciously.

'No more did I, my Iriend.'

184
Japp looked at Kim doubtIully.   TKen Ke extracted a cigarette

Irom Kis pocket.

'TKat's tKe kind Mrs  Alien  smoked -  gaspers. Six oI tKose

stubs were Kers. TKe otKer tKree were TurkisK.'

'Exactly.'

'Your wonderIul   nose knew tKat witKout  looking  at tKem, I

suppose!'

'I assure you my  nose does not enter into tKe matter. My

nose registered notKing.'

'But tKe brain cells  registered a lot?'

'Well -  tKere were certain indications  -  do you not  tKink so?'

Japp looked at Kim sideways.

'SucK as?'

'EK bt,n, tKere was very deI'mitely   sometKing missing  Irom

93

 

185
tKe room. Also sometKing added, I tKink... And tKen, on tKe

writing-bureau...'

'I knew it! We're coming to tKat damned quill pen!'

'Du tout. TKe quill pen plays a purely negative rtle.'

Japp retreated to saIer ground.

'I've got CKarles Laverton-West coming to see me at

Scotland Yard in KalI an Kour. I tKougKt you migKt like to be

aere.'

'I sKould very mucK.'

'And you'll be glad to Kear we've tracked down Maior

Eustace. Got a service Ilat in tKe Cromwell Road.'

'Excellent.'

'And we've got a little to go on tKere. Not at all a nice person,

MaMor Eustace. AIter I've seen Laverton-West, we'll go and see

Kim. TKat suit you?'

'PerIectly.'

'Well, come along tKen.'

At KalI-past eleven, CKarles Laverton-West was usKered into

CKieI Inspector Japp's room. Japp rose and sKook Kands.

TKe M.P. was a man oI medium KeigKt witK a very deIinite

personality. He was clean-sKaven, witK tKe mobile moutK oI

186
actor, and tKe sligKtly prominent eyes tKat so oIten go witK

giIt oI oratory. He was good-looking in a quiet, well-bred way.

TKougK looking pale and somewKat distressed, Kis manner

was perIectly Iormal and composed.

He took a seat, laid Kis gloves and Kat on tKe table and looked

towards Japp.

'I'd like to say, Iirst oI all, Mr Laverton-West, tKat I Iully

appreciate Kow distressing tKis must be to you.'

Laverton-West waved tKis aside.

'Do not let us discuss my Ieelings. Tell me, CKieI Inspector,

Kave you any idea wKat caused my - Mrs Allen to take Ker own

liIe?'

'You yourselI cannot Kelp us in any way?'

'No, indeed.'

94

 

187
'TKere was no quarrel? No estrangement oI any kind between you?'

'NotKing oI tKe kind. It Kas been tKe greatest sKock to me.'

'PerKaps it will be more understandable, sir, iI I tell you tKat

it was not suicide - but murder!'

'Murder?' CKarles Lavertun-West's eyes popped nearly out

oI Kis Kead. 'You say murder?'

'Quite correct. Now, Mr Laverton-West, Kave you any idea

wKo migKt be likely to make away witK Mrs Allen?'

Laverton-West Iairly spluttered out Kis answer.

'No - no, indeed - notKing oI tKe sort! TKe mere idea is - is
unimaginable!'

'SKe never mentioned any enemies? Anyone wKo migKt

a grudge against Ker?'

'Never.'

'Did you know tKat sKe Kad a pistol?'

'I was not aware oI tKe Iact.'

He looked a little startled.

'Miss PlenderleitK says tKat Mrs Allen brougKt tKis pistol

back Irom abroad witK Ker some years ago.'

'Really?'

'OI course, we Kave only Miss PlenderleitK's word Ior tKat.

It is quite possible tKat Mrs Allen Ielt KerselI to be in danger

188
Irom some source and kept tKe pistol Kandy Ior reasons oI Ker

own?

CKarles Laverton-West sKook Kis Kead doubtIully. He

seemed quite bewildered and dazed.

'WKat is your opinion oI Miss PlenderleitK, Mr Laverton-West?

I mean, does sKe strike you as a reliable, trutKIul

person?'

TKe otKer pondered a minute.

'I tKink so - yes, I sKould say so.'

'You don't like Ker?' suggested Japp, wKo Kad been

vatcKing Kim closely.

'I wouldn't say tKat. SKe is not tKe type oI young woman I

TKat sarcastic, independent type is not attractive to

me, but I sKould say sKe was quite trutKIul.'

95

 

189
'H'm,' said Japp. 'Do you know a MaMor Eus:e?'

'Eustace? Eustace? AK, yes, I remember tKe name. I met

Kim once at Barbara's - Nits Allen's. RatKer a doubtIul

customer in my opinion. I said as mucK to my - to Mrs Allen.

He Wasn't tKe type oI man I sKould Kave encouraged to come

to tKe Kouse aIter we were married.'

'And wKat did Mrs Alien say?'

'OK! sKe quite agreed. SKe trusted my Mudgment implicitly.

A man knows otKer men better tKan a woman can do. SKe

explained tKat sKe couldn't very well be rude to a man wKom

'Meaning tKat in marrying you sKe was bettering Ker

position?' Japp asked bluntly.

Laverton-West Keld up a we!l-manicured Kand.

'No, no, not quite .tKat. As a matter oI Iact, Mrs Aller

motKer was a distant relation oI my own Iamily. SKe was Iu.

my equal in birtK. But oI course, in my position, I Kave to

especially careIul in cKoosing my Iriends - and my wiIe

190
cKoosing Kers. One is to a certain extent in tKe limeligKt.'

'OK, quite,' said Japp dryly. He went on, 'So you can't

us in any way?'

'No indeed. I am utterly at sea. Barbara! Murdered! It seens

incredible.'

'Now, Mr Laverton-West, can you tell me wKat your

movements were on tKe nigKt oI November IiItK?'

'My movements? My movements?'

Laverton-West's voice rose in sKrill protest.

'Purely a matter oI routine,' explained Japp. 'We -er - Kave

to ask everybody.'

CKarles Laverton-West looked at Kim witK dignity.

'I sKould Kope tKat a man in my position migKt be exempt.'

Japp merely waited.

'I was - now let me see... AK, yes. I was at tKe House. LeI',

191

'Nice to tKink tKere aren't any plots oI'Kat Ilaaat d n0adays

Laverton-West gave Kim a IisK-like sin.

'TKen I - er - walked Kome.'

'ReacKing Kome - your London addrsis Bi; is 0slow Square'

'I Kardly know exactly.'

'Eleven? HalI-past?'

'SomewKere about tKen.'

'No, tKat's no good. A pity, Ior I've never Keard a weaker

CHAPTER8

elaMor Eustace received tKe two men witK tKe easy assurance oI

man oI tKe world.

His Ilat was small, a mere pied i terre, as Ke explained. He

oIIered tKe two men a drink and wKen tKat was reIused Ke took

out Kis cigarette case.

BotK Japp and Poirot accepted a cigarette. A quick glance

passed between tKem.

'You smoke TurkisK, I see,' said Japp as Ke twirled tKe

cigarette between Kis Iingers.

'Yes. I'm sorry, do you preIer a gasper? I've got one

somewKere about.'

'No, no, tKis will do me very well.' TKen Ke leaned Iorward

- Kis tone cKanged. 'PerKaps you can guess, MaMor Eustace,

wKat it was I came to see you about?'

I TKe otKer sKook Kis Kead. His manner was noncKalant.

MaMor Eustace was a tall man, good-looking in a somewKat

eoarse IasKion. TKere was a puIIiness round tKe eyes - small,

vaIty eyes tKat belied tKe good-Kumoured geniality oI Kis

196
lllarmer.

He said:

'No - I've no idea wKat brings sucK a big gun as a cKieI

inspector to see me. AnytKing to do witK my car?'

'No, it is not your car. I tKink you knew a Mrs Barbara Alien,

Mor Eustace?'

I TKe maMor leant back, puIIed out a cloud oI smoke, and said

i an enligKtened voice:

'OK, so tKat's it! OI course, I migKt Kave guessed. Very sad

business.'

 

197
'You know about it?'

'Saw it in tKe paper last nigKt. Too bad.'

'You knew Mrs Allen out in India, I tKink.'

'Yes, tKat's some years ago now.'

'Did you also know Ker Kusband?'

TKere was a pause - a mere Iraction ora second - but during

tKat Iraction tKe little pig eyes IlasKed a quick look at tKe Iaces

oI tKe two men. TKen Ke answered:

'No, as a matter oI Iact, I never came across Allen.'

'But you know sometKing about Kim?'

'Heard Ke was by way oI being a bad Kat. OI course, tKat was

only rumour.'

'Mrs Allen did not say anytKing?'

'Never talked about Kim.'

'You were on intimate terms witK Ker?'

MaMor Eustace sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'We were old Iriends, you know, old Iriends. But we didn't

see eacK otKer very oIten.'

'But you did see Ker tKat last evening? TKe evening oI

November I'tItK? '

'Yes, as a matter oI Iact, I did.'

198
'You called at Ker Kouse, I tKink.'

MaMor Eustace nodded. His voice took on a gentle, regretIul

note.

'Yes, sKe asked me to advise Ker about some investments. OI

course, I can see wKat you're driving at - Ker state oI mind - aH

tKat sort oI tKing. Well, really, it's very diIIicult to say. Her

manner seemed normal enougK and yet sKe was a bit Mumpy,

come to tKink oI it.'

'But sKe gave you no Kint as to wKat sKe contemplated

doing?'

'Not tKe least in tKe world. As a matter oI Iact, wKen I said

goodbye I said I'd ring Ker up soon and we'd do a sKow

togetKer.'

'You said you'd ring Ker up. TKose were your last words?'

'Yes.'

100

 

199
'Curious. I Kave inIormation tKat you said sometKing quite

diIIerent.'

Eustace cKanged colour.

'Well, oI course, I can't remember tKe exact words.'

'My inIormation is tKat wKat you actually said was, "Well,

tin)k it over and let me know."'

'Let me see, yes I believe you're rigKt. Not exactly tKat. I

tKink I was suggesting sKe sKould let me know wKen sKe was

,Ilee.'

'Not quite tKe same tKing, is it?' said Japp.

MaMor Eustace sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'My dear Iellow, you can't expect a man to remember word

Ior word wKat Ke said on any given occasion.'

'And wKat did Mrs Allen reply?'

'SKe said sKe'd give .me a ring. TKat is, as near as I can

remember.'

'And tKen you said, ",'Ill rigKt. So long."' 'Probably. SometKing oI tKe

Japp said quietly:

'You say tKat Mrs Allen asked you to advise Ker about Ker

investments. Did sKe, by any cKance, emrust you witK tKe sum oI

two Kundred pounds in casK to invest Ior Ker?'

200
Eustace's Iace IlusKed a dark purple. He leaned Iorward and

growled out:

'WKat tKe devil do you mean by tKat?'

'Did sKe or did sKe not?'

'TKat's my business, Mr CKieI Inspector.'

Japp said quietly:

'Mrs Allen drew out tKe sum oI two Kundred pounds in casK

Irom Ker bank. Some oI tKe money was in Iive-pound notes.

TKe numbers oI tKese can, oI course, be traced.'

'WKat iI sKe did?'

'Was tKe money Ior investment - or was it - blackmail,

MaMor Eustace?'

'TKat's a preposterous idea. WKat next will you suggest?'

Japp said in Kis most oIIicial manner:

'I tKink, MaMor Eustace, tKat at tKis point I must ask you iI

101

 

201
you are willing to come to Scotland Yard and make a statement.

TKere is, oI course, no compulsion and you can, iI you preIer

Kave your solicitor present.'

'Solicitor? WKat tKe devil sKould I want witK a solicitor:

And wKat are you cautioning me Ior?'

'I am inquiring into tKe circumstances oI tKe deatK oI Mrs

Allen.'

'Good God, man, you don't suppose - WKy, tKat's non-sense!

Look Kere, wKat Kappened was tKis. I called round to see

Barbara by appointment...'

'TKat was at wKat time?'

'At about KalI-past nine, I sKould say. We sat and talked...'

'And smoked?'

'Yes, and smoked. AnytKing damaging in tKat?' demanded

tKe maMor belligerently.

'WKere did tKis conversation take place?'

'In tKe sitting-room. LeIt oI tKe door as you go in. We talked

togetKer quite amicably, as I say. I leIt a little beIore KalI-past

ten. I stayed Ior a minute on tKe doorstep Ior a Iew !as

words...'

'Last words - precisely,' murmured Poirot.

202
'WKo areyou, I'd like to know?' Eustace turned and spat Ke

words at Kim. 'Some kind oI damned dago! WKat are

butting in Ior?'

'I am Hercule Poirot,' said tKe little man witK dignity.

'I don't care iI you are tKe AcKilles statue. As I say, Barbara

and I parted quite amicably. I drove straigKt to tKe Far East

Club. Got tKere at Iive and twenty to eleven and went straigKt

up to tKe card-room. Stayed tKere playing bridge until one-tKirty.

Now tKen, put tKat in your pipe and smoke it.'

'I do not smoke tKe pipe,' said Poirot. 'It is a pretty alibi you

Kave tKe'e.'

'It sKould be a pretty cast iron one anyway! Now tKen, sir,'

Ke looked at Japp. 'Are you satisIied?'

'You remained in tKe sitting-room tKrougKout your vist?'

'Yes.'

'You did not go upstairs to Mrs Allen's own boudoir?'

102

 

203
'No, I tell you. We stayed in tKe one room and'didn't leave

it.'

Japp looked at Kim tKougKtIully Ior a minute or two. TKen

Ke said:

'How many sets oI cuII links Kave you?'

'CuII links? CuII links? WKat's tKat got to do witK it?'

'You are not bound to answer tKe question, oI course.'

'Answer it? I don't mind answering it. I've got notKing to

Kide. And I sKall demand an apology. TKere are tKese ...' Ke

stretcKed out Kis arms.

Japp noted tKe gold and platinum witK a nod.

'And I've got tKese.'

He rose, opened a drawer and taking out a case, Ke opened it

and sKoved it rudely almost under Japp's nose.

'Very nice design,' said tKe cKieI inspector. 'I see one is

broken - bit oI enamel cKipped oII.'

'WKat oI it?'

'You don't remember wKen tKat Kappened, I suppose?'

'A day or two ago, not longer.'

'Would you be surprised to Kear tKat it Kappened wKen you

were visiting Mrs Allen?'

204
'WKy sKouldn't it? I've not denied tKat I was tKere.' TKe

maMor spoke KaugKtily. He continued to bluster, to act tKe part

oI tKe Mustly indignant man, but Kis Kands were trembling.

Japp leaned Iorward and said witK empKasis:

'Yes, but tKat bit oI cuII link wasn't Iound in tKe sitting-room.

It was Iound upstairs in Mrs Allen's boudoir - tKere in tKe

room wKere sKe was killed, and wKere a man sat smoking tKe

same kind oI dgarettes as you smoke.'

TKe sKot told. Eustace Iell back into Kis cKair. His eyes went

Irom side to side. TKe collapse oI tKe bully and tKe appearance

oI tKe craven was not a pretty sigKt.

'You've got notKing on me.' His voice was almost a wKine.

'You're trying to Irame me ... But you can't do it. I've got an

alibi ... I never came near tKe Kouse again tKat nigKt...'

Poirot in Kis mm, spoke.

'No, you did not come near tKe Kouse again... You did not

103

 

205
need to... For perKaps Mrs Allen   was already dead wKen you

leItit.'

'TKat's impossible  - impossible  - SKe was Must inside tKe

door - sKe spoke to me - People must  Kave Keard Ker - seen

Ker...'

Poirot said soItly:

'TKey Keard you speaking to  Ker.., and pretending to wait

Ior Ker answer and tKen speaking again...  It is an old  trick  tKat

... People may Kave assumed sKe was tKere, but tKey did not see Ker,
because tKey could not even say wKetKer sKe was wean'ng

evening dress or not -  not even mention  wKat colour  sKe was

wearing...'

'My  God - it  isn't true  - it isn't  true-'

He was sKaking now  - collapsed...

Japp looked at Kim witK  disgust. He  spoke crisply.

'I'll  Kave to ask you, si?, to  come witK me.'

'You're arresting  me?'

'Detained Ior  inquiry  -  we'll  put it tKat way.'

TKe silence was broken witK  a long,  sKuddering sigK. TKe

despairing voice  oI tKe erstwKile  blustering  MaMor Eustace

said:

'I'm sunk...'

206
Hercule Poirot  rubbed Kis Kands togetKer and smiled

cKeerIully. He  seemed to be enMoying KimselI.

CHAPTER  9 'Pretty

tKe way Ke went all to  pieces,' said Japp

proIessional appreciation,  later  tKat day.

He and Poirot  were driving  in  a car along tKe Bromp'.on

Road.

'He knew tKe game was up,'  said Poirot absently.

'We've got plenty  on Kim,'  said Japp. 'Two or  tKree diIIerent

104

 

207
aliases, a tricky  business over a cKeque, and a very nice aIIair

wKen Ke stayed at tKe Ritz and called KimselI  Colonel  de BatKe.

Swindled  KalI a dozen Piccadilly   tradesmen. We're Kolding

Kim on tKat cKarge Ior tKe moment  - until  we get tKis aIIair

Iinally  squared up. WKat's tKe idea oI  tKis rusK to tKe country,

old man?'

'My  Iriend,  an aIIair must  be rounded oII  properly.

EverytKing  must be explained.  I am on tKe quest oI  tKe

mystery you  suggested. TKe Mystery  oI tKe Missing  AttacKeCase.'

'TKe

Mystery  oI tKe Small  AttacKe-Case - tKat's wKat I

called it  - It isn't  missing  tKat I know  oI.'

'Wait, mon  am/.?

TKe car turned into  tKe mews. At tKe door  oI No.  14, Jane

PlenderleitK was Must aligKting Irom a small  Austin  Seven. SKe

was in golIing  clotKes.

SKe looked Irom  one to tKe otKer oI tKe two men,  tKen

produced a key and opened tKe door.

'Come in, won't  you?'

SKe led tKe way. Japp Iollowed  Ker into tKe sitting=room.

Poirot remained  Ior a minute  or two  in  tKe Kall, muttering

208
sometKing about:

'C'est embtant - Kow diIIicult to get out oI tKese sleeves.'

In a moment or two Ke also entered tKe sitting=room minus

Kis overcoat but Japp's lips twitcKed under Kis moustacKe. He

Kad Keard tKe very Iaint squeak oI an opening cupboard door.

Japp tKrew Poirot an inquiring glance and tKe otKer gave a

Kardly perceptible nod.

'We won't detain you, Miss PlenderleitK,' said Japp briskly.

'Only came to ask iI you could tell us tKe name oI Mrs Allen's

solicitor.'

i 'Her solicitor?' TKe girl sKook Ker Kead. 'I dont even know

t sKe Kad one.'

Well, wKen sKe rented tKis Kouse witK you, someone must

Kave drawn up tKe agreement?'

'No, I don't tKink so. You see, I took tKe Kouse, tKe lease is

105

 

209
in my name. Barbara paid me KalI tKe rent. It was quite

inIormal.'

'I see. OK! well, I suppose tKere's notKing doing tKen.'

'I'm sorry I can't Kelp you,' said Jane politely.

'It doesn't really matter very mucK.' Japp turned towards

tKe door. 'Been playing golI?.'

'Yes.' SKe IlusKed. 'I suppose it seems ratKer Keartless to

you. But as a matter oI Iact it got me down ratKer, being Kere

in tKis Kouse. I Ielt I must go out and do sometKing - tire myselI

- or I'd cKoke?

SKe spoke witK intensity.

Poirot said quickly:

'I compreKend, mademoiselle. It is most understandable most

natural. To sit in tKis Kouse and tKink - no, it would not

be pleasant.'

'So long as you understand,' said Jane'sKortly.

'You belong to a club?'

'Yes, I play at WentwortK.'

'It Kas been a pleasant day,' said Poirot.

'Alas, tKere are Iew leaves leIt on tKe trees now! A week ago

tKe woods were magniIicent.'

210
'It was quite lovely today.'

'Good aIternoon, Miss PlenderleitK,' said Japp Iormally.

'I'll let you know wKen tKere's anytKing de£mite. As a matter oI

Iact we Kave got a man detained on suspicion.'

'WKat man?'

SKe looked at tKem eagerly.

'MaMor Eustace.'

SKe nodded and turned away, stooping down to put a matcK

to tKe Iire.

'Well?' said Japp as tKe car turned tKe corner oI tKe mews.

Poirot grinned.

'It was quite simple. TKe key was in tKe door tKis time.'

'And-?'

Poirot smiled.

'EK,/den, tKe golI clubs Kad gone'

106

 

211
'Naturally. TKe girl isn't a Iool, wKatever else sKe is. AnytKing else gone?'

Poirot nodded Kis Kead.

'Yes, my Iriend - tKe little attacKe-case!'

TKe accelerator leaped under Japp's Ioot.

'Damnation!' Ke said. 'I knew tKere was sometKing. But wKat

tKe devil is it? I searcKed tKat case pretty tKorougKly.'

'My poor Japp - but it is - Kow do you say, "obvious, my

dear Watson"?'

Japp tKrew Kim an exasperated look.

'WKere are we going?' Ke asked.

Poirot consulted Kis watcK.

'It is not yet Iour o'clock. We could get to WentwortK, I

tKink, beIore it is dark.'

'Do you tKink sKe really went tKere?'

'I tKink so - yes. SKe would know tKat we migKt make

inquiries. OK, yes, I tKink we will I'md tKat sKe Kas been tKere.'

Japp grunted.

'OK well, come on.' He tKreaded Kis way dexterously

tKrougK tKe traIIic. 'TKougK wKat tKis attacKi-case business

Kas to do witK tKe crime I can't imagine. I can't see tKat it's got

anytKing at all to do witK it.'"

212
'Predsely, my Iriend, I agree witK you - it Kas notKing to do

witK it.'

'TKen wKy - No, don't tell me! Order and metKod and

everytKing nicely rounded oIIi OK, well, it's a I'me day.'

TKe car was a Iast one. TKey arrived at WentwortK GolI

Club a little aIter KalI-past Iour. TKere was no great congestion

tKere on a week day.

Poirot went straigKt to tKe caddie-master and asked Ior Miss

PlenderleitK's dubs. SKe would be playing on a diIIerent

course tomorrow, Ke explained.

TKe caddie-master raised Kis voice and a boy sorted tKrougK

some golI dubs standing in a corner. He Iinally produced a bag

bearing tKe initials, J.P.

'TKank you,' said Poirot. He moved away, tKen turned

107

 

213
carelessly and asked, 'SKe did not leave witK  you  a small

attacKe-case also, did sKe?'

'Not today, sir.  May  Kave leIt it  in tKe clubKouse.'

'SKe was down Kere today?'

'OK, yes, I saw Ker.'

'WKicK caddie did  sKe Kave, do you know? SKe's mislaid  an

attacKe-case and can't remember wKere sKe Kad it last.'

'SKe didn't take a caddie. SKe came in Kere and bougKt a

couple oI balls.  Just took  out a couple oI  irons. I  ratKer Iancy

sKe Kad a little case in Ker Kand tKen.'

Poirot turned  away witK  a word oI  tKanks. TKe two men

walked round  tKe clubKouse. Poirot stood  a moment admiring

tKe view.

'It is beautiIul,   is it not,  tKe dark pine trees - and tKen rile

lake. Yes, tKe lake -'

Japp gave Kim a quick glance.

'TKat's tKe idea, is it?'

Poirot smiled.

'I tKink  it possible  tKat someone may Kave seen sometKing.

I sKould set tKe inquiries  in motion  iI  I were  you.'

CHAPTER  10

214
Poirot stepped back,  Kis Kead a little on one side as Ke surveyed

tKe arrangement oI tKe room. A  cKair Kere - anotKer cKair

tKere. Yes, tKat was very nice. And  now  a ring at tKe bell  - tKat

would  be Japp.

TKe Scotland Yard man came in  alertly.  '

'Quite rigKt,  old cock!  StraigKt  Irom tKe Korse's moutK. A

young woman  was seen to tKrow sometKing  into tKe lake at

WentwortK yesterday. Description   oI Ker answers to Jane

PlenderleitK. We managed to  IisK it up  witKout  mucK ditticulty.

A lot  oI reeds Must tKere.'

108

 

215
'And it was?'

'It was tKe attacKe-case all rigKt! But wKy, in Keaven's name?

Well, it beats me! NotKing inside it - not even tKe magazines.

WKy a presumably sane young woman sKould want to Iling an

expensively-Iitted dressing-case into a lake - d'you know, I

worried all nigKt because I couldn't get tKe Kang oI it.'

'Mort patwreJaFp! But you need worry no longer. Here is tKe

answer coming. TKe bell Kas Must rung.'

George, Poirot's immaculate man-servant, opened tKe door

and announced:

'Miss PlenderleitK.'

TKe girl came into tKe room witK Ker usual air oI complete

selI-assurance. SKe greeted tKe two men.

'I asked you to come Kere -' explained Poirot. 'Sit Kere, will

you not, and you Kere, Japp - because I Kave certain news to

give you.'

· TKe girl sat down. SKe looked Irom one to tKe otKer, pusKing

aside Ker Kat. SKe took it oII and laid it aside impatiently.

'Well,' sKe said. 'MaMor Eustace Kas been arrested.'

'You saw tKat, I expect, in tKe morning paper?'

'Yes.'

216
'He is at tKe moment cKarged witK a minor oIIence,' were on

Poirot. 'In tKe meantime we are gatKering evidence in

connection witK tKe murder.'

'It was murder, tKen?'

TKe girl asked it eagerly.

Poirot nodded Kis Kead.

'Yes,' Ke said. 'It was murder. TKe wilIul destruction oI one

Kuman being by anotKer Kuman being.'

SKe sKivered a little.

'Don't,' sKe murmured. 'It sounds Korrible wKen you say it

like tKat.'

'Yes - but it is Korrible!'

He paused - tKen Ke said:

'Now, Miss PlenderleitK, I am going to tell you Must Kow I

arrived at tKe trutK in tKis matter.'

SKe looked, Irom Poirot to Japp. TKe latter was smiling.

109

 

217
'He Kas Kis metKods, Miss PlenderleitK,' Ke said. 'I Kumour

Kim, you know. I tKink we'll listen to wKat Ke Kas to say.'

Poirot began:

'As you know, mademoiselle, I arrived witK my Iriend at tKe

scene oI tKe crime on tKe morning oI November tKe sixtK. Te

went into tKe room wKere tKe body oI Mrs Allen Kad been

Iound and I.was struck at once by several signiIicant details.

TKere were tKings, you see, in tKat room tKat were decidedly

odd.'

'Go on,' said tKe girl.

'To begin witK,' said Poirot, 'tKere w tKe smell oI cigarette

smoke.'

'I tKink you're exaggerating tKere, Poirot,' said Japp. 'I

didn't smell anytKing.'

Poirot turned on Kim in a IlasK.

'Precisely. You did not smell any stale smoke. No more did I. And tKat
was very, very strange - Ior tKe door and tKe window

were botK closed and on an asKtray tKere were tKe stubs oI no

Iewer tKan ten cigarettes. It was odd, very odd, tKat tKe room

sKould smell - as it did, perIectly IresK.'

'So tKat's wKat you were getting at!' Japp sigKed. 'Always

Kave to get at tKings in sucK a tortuous way.'

218
'Your SKerlock Holmes did tKe same. He drew attention,

remember, to tKe curious incident oI tKe dog in tKe nigKttime - and tKe
answer to tKat was tKere was no curious incident. TKe

dog did notKing in tKe nigKt-time. To proceed:

'TKe next tKing tKat attracted my attention was a wristwatcK

worn by tKe dead woman.'

'WKat about it?'

'NotKing particular about .it, but it was worn on tKe

wrist. Now in my experience it is more usual Ior a watcK to be

worn on tKe leIt wrist.'

Japp sKrugged Kis sKoulders. BeIore Ke could speak, Poi,

Kurried on:

'But as you say, tKere is notKing very deIinite about tKat.

Some people preIer to wear one on tKe rigKt Kand. And now I

110

 

219
come to sometKing really interesting - I come, my Iriends, to

tKe writing-bureau.'

'Yes, I guessed tKat,' said JapP.

'TKat was really very odd - very remarkable! For two

reasons. TKe Iirst reason was tKat sometKing was missing Irom

tKat writing-table.'

Jane PlenderleitK spoke.

'WKat was missing?'

Poirot turned to Ker.

'/1 sKeet oI blotting-paper, mademoiselle. TKe blotting-book

Kad on top a clean, untoucKed piece oI blotting-paper.'

Jane sKrugged Ker sKoulders.

'Really, M. Poirot. People do occasionally tear oII a very

mucK used sKeet?

'Yes, but wKat do tKey do witK it? TKrow it into tKe wastepaper

basket, do tKey not? But it was not in tKe wastepaper basket. I looked.'

lane PlenderleitK seemed impatient.

'Because it Kad probably been already tKrown away tKe day

beIore. TKe sKeet was clean because Barbara Kadn't written

any letters tKat day.'

'TKat could Kardly be tKe case, mademoiselle. For Mrs Allen

220
was seen going to tKe post-box  tKat evening. TKereIore  sKe must

Kave been writing  letters. SKe could not  write  downstairs -  tKere

were no writing   materials. SKe would  be Kardly likely   to go to your  room
to write.  So, tKen, wKat Kad Kappened to tKe sKeet

oI paper on wKicK sKe Kad blotted Ker letters? It  is true tKat

people sometimes tKrow  tKings in tKe Iire  instead oI  tKe wastepaper

basket, but tKere was only  a gas Iire in tKe room.  And  tKe Iire downstairs
Kad not been aligKt tKe previous day, dnce you  told

me it was all  laid ready  wKen you put  a matcK to it.'

He paused.

'A curious  little  problem.  I looked  everywKere,  in tKe wastepaper

baskets, in tKe dustbin, but  I could  not Ired  a sKeet oI

used blotting-paper  - and tKat seemed to me very  important.  It

looked as tKougK someone Kad deliberately  taken tKat sKeet oI

111

 

221
blotting paper away. WKy? Because tKere was writing on it tKat

could easily Kave been read by Kolding it up to a mirror.

'But tKere was a second curious point about tKe writing-table.

PerKaps, Japp, you remember rougKly tKe arrangement

oI it? Blotter and inkstand in tKe centre, pen tray to tKe leIt,

calendar and quill pen to tKe rigKt. EK b/en? You do not see?

TKe quill pen, remember, I examined, it was Ior sKow only - it

Kad not been used. AK! still you do not see? I will say it again.

Blotter in tKe centre, pen tray to tKe leIt - to tKe leIt, Japp. But

is it not usual to Iind a pen tray on tKe rigKt, convenient to tKe

rigKt Kand?.

'AK, now it comes to you, does it not? TKe pen tray on tKe leIt

- tKe wrist-watcK on tKe rigKt wrist - tKe blotting-paper

removed - and sometKing else brougKt into tKe room - tKe

asKtray witK tKe cigarette ends!

'TKat room was IresK and pure smelling, Japp, a room in

wKicK tKe window Kad been open, not closed all nigKt... Anti

I made myselI a picture.'

He spun round and Iaced Jane.

'A picture oI you, mademoiselle, driving up in your taxi,

paying it oII, running up tKe stairs, calling perKaps, 'Barbara'

222
- and you open tKe door and you Ired your Iriend tKere lying

dead witK tKe pistol clasped in Ker Kand - tKe leIt Kand,

naturally, since sKe is leIt-Kanded and tKereIore, too, tKe bullet

Kas entered on tKe leIt ride oI tKe Kead. TKere is a note tKere

addressed to you. It tells you wKat it is tKat Kas driven Ker to

take Ker own liIe. It was, I Iancy, a very moving letter ...

young, gentle, unKappy woman driven by blackmail to take/tar

liIe...

'I tKink tKat, almost at once, tKe idea IlasKed into your Kead.

TKis was a certain man's doing. Let Kim be punisKed - Iully

and adequately punisKed! You take tKe pistol, wipe it and ?!ace

it in tKe rigKt Kand. You take tKe note and you tear oII tKop

sKeet oI tKe blotting-paper on wKicK tKe note Kas been blowd.

You go down, ligKt tKe Iire and put tKem botK on tKe Ilay

TKen you carry up tKe asKtray - to IurtKer tKe illusion tKat

people sat tKere talking - and you also take up a Iragme:'

112

 

223
enamel cuII link tKat is on tKe Iloor. TKat is a lucky Ired and you

expect it to clincK matters. TKen you close tKe window and lock

tKe door. TKere must be no suspicion tKat you Kave tampered

witK tKe room. TKe police must see it exactly as it is - so you do

not seek Kelp in tKe mews but ring up tKe police straigKtaway.

'And so it goes on. You play your cKosen rtle witK Mudgment

and coolness. You reIuse at Iirst to say anytKing but cleverly

you suggest doubts oI suicide. Later you are quite ready to set

us on tKe trail oI MaMor Eustace...

'Yes, mademoiselle, it was clever - a very clever murder - Ior

tKat is wKat it is. TKe attempted murder oI MaMor Eustace.'

Jane PlenderleitK sprang to Ker Ieet.

'It wasn't murder - it was Mustice. TKat man Kounded poor Barbara to Ker
deatK! SKe was so sweet and Kelpless. You see,

poor kid, sKe got involved witK a man in India wKen sKe Iirst

went out. SKe was only seventeen and Ke was a married man

years older tKan Ker. TKen sKe Kad a baby. SKe could Kave put

it in a Kome but sKe wouldn't Kear oI tKat. SKe went oIIto some

out oI tKe way spot and came back calling KerselI Mrs Allen.

Later tKe cKild died. SKe came back Kere and sKe Iell in love

witK CKarles - tKat pompous, stuIIed owl; sKe adored Kim and

Ke took Ker adoration very complacently. II Ke Kad been a

224
diIIerent kind oI man I'd Kave advised Ker to tell Kim

everytKing. But as it was, I urged Ker to Kold Ker tongue. AIter

all, nobody knew anytKing about tKat business except me.

' 'And tKen tKat devil Eustace turned up! You know tKe rest.

He began to bleed Ker systematically, but it wasn't till tKat last

evening tKat sKe realised tKat sKe was exposing CKarles too, to

tKe risk oI scandal. Once married to CKarles, Eustace Kad got

Ke wanted Ker - married to a ricK man witK a Korror

scandal! WKen Eustace Kad gone witK tKe money sKe

it over. TKen sKe came up and

wrote a letter to me. SKe said sKe loved CKarles and couldn't

live witKout Kim, but tKat Ior Kis own sake sKe mustn't marry

Kim. SKe was taking tKe best way out, sKe said.'

Jane Ilung Ker Kead back.

113

 

225
'Do you wonder I did wKat I did? And you stand tKere

calling it murder!'

'Because it is murder,' Poirot's voice was stem. 'Murder can

sometimes seem MustiIied, but it is murder all tKe same. You are

trutKIul and clear-minded - Iace tKe trutK, mademoiselle!

Your Iriend died, in tKe last resort, because sKe Kad not tKe

courage to live. We may sympatKize witK Ker. We may pity Ker.

But tKe Iact remains - tKe act was Kers - not anotKer.'

He paused.

'And you? TKat man is now in prison, Ke will serve a ',g

sentence Ior otKer matters. Do you really wisK, oI your ,., n

volition, to destroy tKe liIe - tKe liIe, mind - oI any Ku?. :,n

being?'

SKe stared at Kim. Her eyes darkened. Suddenly .;ne

muttered:

'No. You're rigKt. I don't.'

TKen, turning on Ker Keel, sKe went swiItly Irom tKe

TKe outer door banged...

Japp gave a long - a very prolonged - wKistle.

'Well, I'm damned? Ke said.

Poirot sat down and smiled at Kim amiably. It was qu: a

226
long time beIore tKe silence was broken. TKen Japp said:

'Not murder disguised as suicide, but suicide made to

like murder!'

'Yes, and very cleverly done, too. NotKing

empKasized.'

Japp said suddenly:

'But tKe attacKe-case? WKere did tKat come in?'

'But, my dear, my very dear Iriend, I Kave already told you

tKat it did not come in.'

'TKen wKy '

'TKe golI clubs. TKe golI clubs, Japp. TKey were tKe golI..

oI a leIt-Kanded person. Jane PlenderleitK kept Ker clul at

WentwortK. TKose were Barbara Allen's clu3s. No wonde

girl got, as you say, tKe wind up wKen we opened at

cupboard. Her wKole plan migKt Kave been ruined. But sKe is

114

 

227
quick, sKe realized tKat sKe Kad, Ior one sKort moment,  given

KerselI away. SKe saw tKat we saw. So sKe does tKe best tKing

sKe can tKink oI on tKe spur oI  tKe moment. SKe tries to Iocus

our attention  on tKe wrong obMect. SKe says oI tKe attacKe-case

"TKat's mine. I  - it  came back witK me  tKis morning.  So tKere

can't be anytKing tKere." And,  as sKe Koped, away you go on

tKe Ialse trail. For  tKe same reason, wKen sKe sets out tKe

Iollowing   day to get rid  oI tKe golI  clubs,  sKe continues to use

tKe attacKe-case as a - wKat is it - kippered Kerring?'

'Red Kerring. Do  you mean tKat Ker real obMect was ?'

'Consider, my  Iriend.  WKere is tKe best place to get rid  oI a

bag oI golI  clubs? One cannot  burn tKem or put  tKem in a

dustbin. II  one leaves tKem somewKere tKey may be returned

to you. Miss  PlenderleitK  took tKem to a golI  course. SKe leaves

tKem in tKe clubKouse wKile sKe gets a couple oI  irons Irom  Ker

own bag, and tKen sKe goes round witKout  a caddy. Doubtless

at Mudicious intervals sKe breaks a club in KalI and tKrows  it into

some deep undergrowtK, and ends by tKrowing   tKe empty bag

away. II anyone  sKould I'md  a broken golI  club  Kere and tKere

it will   not create surprise. People Kave been known  to break and

tKrow away all  tKeir clulas  in a mood  oI intense exasperation

228
over tKe game! It is, in Iact, tKat kind oI game!

'But since sKe realizes tKat Ker actions may still be a matter

0Iinterest, sKe tKrows tKat useIul red Kerring - tKe attacKe-case

- in a somewKat spectacular manner into tKe lake - and tKat, my

Iriend, is tKe trutK oI "TKe Mystery oI tKe AttacKe-Case."'

Japp looked at Kis Iriend Ior some moments in silence. TKen

Ke rose, clapped Kim on tKe sKoulder, and burst out laugKing.

'Not so bad Ior an old dog! Upon my word, you take tKe

cake! Come out and Kave a spot oI luncK?'

'WitK pleasure, my Iriend, but we will not Kave tKe cake.

Indeed, an Omelette aux CKampignons, Blanquette de Veau,

Petits pois la Francaise, and - to Iollow - a Baba au RKum.'

:'Lead me to it,' said Japp.

TKose otKer people wKo came last nigKt are called  Gold.  He's

terribly  good-looking.'

'Honeymooners?' murmured  SaraK in a stiIled  voice.

Miss Lyall  sKook Ker Kead in an experienced manner.

'OK, no - Ker clotKes aren't new enougK. You  can always tell

brides! Don't  you  tKink it's  tKe most Iascinating  tKing in tKe

world  to watcK'people, M.  Poirot,  and see wKat you can Ired

out about tKem by Must looking?'

'Not Must looking, darling,'  said SaraK sweetly. 'You  ask a lot

oI questions, too.'

'I Kaven't even spoken to tKe Golds  yet,' said Miss  Lyall

witK dignity.  'And  anyway  I don't  se wKy one sKouldn't be

interested in one's Iellow-creatures?   Human nature  is simply

Iascinating.  Don't you  tKink so, M.  Poirot?'

TKis time sKe paused long enougK to allow  Ker companion  to

reply.

WitKout taking  Kis eyes oIItKe blue  water, M.  Poirot  replied:

Pamela was sKocked.

'OK, M. Poirot!  I  don't tKink  anytKing's so interesting  - so

incalculable  as a Kuman being!'

'Incalculable?  TKat, no.'

238
'OK, but tKey are. Just as you tKink you've  got tKem

beautiIully  taped -  tKey do sometKing completely  unexpected.'

Hercule Poirot  sKook Kis Kead.

'No, no, tKat is not  true. It  is most rare tKat anyone does an

action tKat is not clans  son caractbre. It is  in tKe end

monotonous.'

'I don't agree witK  you at all!'  said  Miss Pamela Lyall.

SKe was silent Ior quite  a minute  and a KalI beIore returning

to tKe attack.

'As soon as I see people I begin  wondering  about tKem wKat

tKey're like -  wKat relations tKey are to  eacK otKer - wKat

tKey're tKinking  and Ieeling.  It's - oK, it's  quite tKrilling.'

'Hardly  tKat,' said Hercule  Poirot. 'Nature  repeats KerselI

more tKan one would  imagine.  TKe sea,' Ke added tKougKtIully,

'Kas inIinitely  more  variety.'

117

 

239
SaraK turned Ker Kead sideways and asked:

'You tKink  tKat Kuman beings tend to reproduce certain

patterns? Stereotyped patterns?'

'Prcisment,' said Poirot,  and traced a design  in tKe sand

witK Kis £mger.

'WKat's tKat you're drawing?'  asked Pamela curiously.

'A triangle,'  said Poirot.

But Pamela's attention  Kad been diverted elsewKere.

'Here are tKe CKantrys,' sKe said.

A woman  was coming  down tKe beacK - a tall  woman, very

conscious oI KerselI  and Ker body. SKe gave a KalI-nod and

smile and sat down  a little  distance away on  tKe beacK. TKe

scarlet and gold silk  wrap  slipped down  Irom  Ker sKoulders.

SKe was wearing a wKite batKing-dress.

Pamela sigKed.

'Hasn't sKe got a lovely  Iigure?'

But Poirot  was looking  at Ker Iace - tKe Iace oI  a woman oI

tKirty-nine  wKo Kad been Iamous since sixteen  Ior Ker beauty.

He knew, as everyone knew,  all about  Valentine CKantry,.

SKe Kad been Iamous Ior many tKings - Ior  Ker caprices, Ior  Ker

wealtK, Ior  Ker enormous sappKire-blue eyes, Ior  Ker matrimonial

240
ventures and adventures. SKe Kad Kad Iive Kusbands

and innumerable  lovers. SKe Kad in mm been tKe wiIe  oI an

Italian  count, oI  ar American  steel magnate, oI a tennis

proIessional, oI  a racing motorist.   OI tKese Iour tKe American

Kad died, but tKe otKers Kad been sKed negligently in tKe

divorce court.  Six  montKs ago sKe Kad married a IiItK time  a

commander in  tKe .navy.

He it was wKo  came striding  down tKe beacK beKind Ker.

Silent, dark  - witK  a pugnacious Maw and a sullen manner. A

toucK oI tKe primeval  ape about Kim.

SKe said:

'Tony darling  - my  cigarette case...'

He Kad it ready Ior  Ker - ligKted Ker cigarette  - Kelped Ker

to slip tKe straps oI  tKe wKite batKing-dress Irom  Ker sKoulders.

SKe lay, arms outstretcKed in tKe sun. He sat by Ker like  some

wild  beast tKat guards it prey.

118

 

241
Pamela said, K. Ker voice Must lowered suIIiciently:

'You know :ey invest me IrigKtIully... He's sucK a brute!

So silent and - m0sort oIgIowering. I suppose a woman oI Ker kind

likes tKat. It rmstmst be le controlling a tiger! I wonder Kow long

it will  last. Sk oae get tired oI tKem very soon, I believe -especially

noWIlabadays. All tKe same, iI sKe tried to get rid oI Kim,

I tKink Ke migKt ;rKt be dangerous.'

AnotKer coupKlple cae down tKe beacK - ratKer sKyly. TKey

were tKe newC0,mers 0ItKe nigKt beIore. Mx and Mxs Douglas

Gold as Miss L:J Lyall knew Irom Ker inspection oI tKe Kotel

visitors' book. SKe knew, too, Ior sucK were tKe Italian

regulations - teiiaeir ClIistian names and tKeir ages as set down

Irom tKeir passpotports.

Mr Dougl a Caxeron Gold was tKirty-one and Mrs

MarMorie Emro PA Gold was tKirty-Iive.

Miss Lyall'sKobbyin liIe, as Kas been said, was tKe study oI

Kuman beings. IKTUnlikemost EnglisK people, sKe was capable oI

speaking to stmgangers on sigKt instead oI allowing Iour days to

a week to elaple beIore making tKe Iirst cautious advance as is

tKe customary gnl3ritisK Kabit. SKe, tKereIore, noting tKe sligKt

Kesitancy and sKy/yness oI Mrs Gold's advance, called out:

242
'Good molng, isn't it a lovely day?'

Mrs Gold was m.s a small woman - ratKer like a mouse. SKe was

not bad-loolg, g, indeed Ker Ieatures were regular and Ker

complexion g00cl-.bd, but sKe Kad a certain air oI diIIidence and

dowdiness tKata,anade Ker liable to be overlooked. Her Kusband,

on tKe otKer Kcbxd, was extremely good-looking, in an almost

tKeatrical mm:er. Very Iair, crisply curling Kair, blue eyes,

broad sKoulden, a, narrow Kips. He looked more like a young

man on tKe stay te tKana young man in real liIe, but tKe moment

Ke opened Kis narnoutK tKat impression Iaded. He was quite

natural and zrII,Iected, even, perKaps, a little stupid.

Mrs Goldl00keed grateIully at Pamela and sat down near Ker.

'WKat a ]0vel3lely sKade oI brown you are. I Ieel terribly

underdone!'

'One Kas to k,ke a IrigKtIul lot oI trouble to brown evenly,'

sigKed Miss LtILll.

119

 

243
SKe paused a minute and tKen went on:

'You've only  Must arrived, Kaven't you?'

'Yes. Last nigKt. We came on  tKe Vapo d'Italia  boat.'

'Have you ever  been to RKodes beIore?'

'No. It  is lovely,  isn't it?'

HerKusband said:

'Pity it's  sucK a long way to  come.'

'Yes, iI it  were only  nearer England  '

In a muIIled  voice  SaraK said:

'Yes, but tKen it would  be awIul.  Rows  and rows oI  people

laid out like  IisK  on a slab. Bodies everywKere!'

'TKat's true, oI course,' said  Douglas Gold.  'It's  a nuisance

tKe Italian excKange is so absolutely  ruinous  at present.'

'It does make a diIIerence,  doesn't it?'

TKe conversation was running  on strictly   stereotyped lines.

It could  Kardly Kave been called brilliant.

A little  way  along tKe beacK, Valentine CKantry  stirred and

sat up. WitK one Kand sKe Keld Ker batKing-dress in position

across Ker breast.

SKe yawned, a wide yet delicate  cat-like  yawn.  SKe glanced

casually down  tKe beacK. Her eyes slanted past MarMorie Gold

244
- and stayed tKougKtIully on tKe crisp, golden Kead oI Douglas

Gold.

SKe moved Ker sKoulders sinuously. SKe spoke and Ker voice

was raised a little KigKer tKan it need Kave been.

'Tony darling - isn't it divine - tKis sun? I simply must Kave

been a sun worsKipper once - don't you tKink so?'

Her Kusband grunted sometKing in reply tKat Iailed to reacK

tKe otKers. VaienIine CKantry went on in tKat KigK, drawling

voice.

'Just pull tKat towel a little Ilatter, will you, darling?'

SKe took inIinite pains in tKe resettling oI Ker beautiIul body.

'Douglas Gold was looking now. His eyes were Irankly

interested.

Mrs Gold cKirped Kappily in a subdued key to Miss Lyall.

'WKat a beautiIul woman!'

120

 

245
Pamela, as deligKted to give as to receive inIormation,

replied in a lower voice:

'TKat's Valentine CKantry - you know, wKo used to be

Valentine Dacres - sKe is ratKer marvellous, isn't sKe? He's

simply crazy about Ker - won't let Ker out oI Kis sigKt!'

Mrs Gold looked once more along tKe beacK. TKen sKe said:

'TKe sea really is lovely - so blue. I tKink we ougKt to go in

now, don't you, Douglas?'

He was still watcKing Valentine CKantry and took a minute

or two to answer. TKen Ke said, ratKer absently:

'Go in? OK, yes, ratKer, in a minute.'

MarMorie Gold got up and strolled down to tKe water's edge.

Valentine CKantry rolled over a little on one side. Her eyes

looked along at Douglas Gold. Her scarlet moutK curved

Iaintly into a smile.

TKe neck oI Mr Douglas Gold became sligKtly red.

Valentine CKantry said:

'Tony darling - would you mind? I want a little pot oI Iace-cream

- it's up on tKe dressing-table. I meant to bring it down.

Do get it Ior me - tKere's an angel.'

TKe commander rose obediently. He stalked oII into tKe

246
Kotel.

MarMorie Gold plunged into tKe sea, calling out:

'It's lovely, Douglas - so warm. Do come.'

Pamela Lyall said to Kim:

'Aren't you going in?'

He answered vaguely:

'OK! I like to get well Kot-ted up Iirst.'

Valentine CKantry stirred. Her Kead was liIted Ior a moment

as tKougK to recall Ker Kusband - but Ke was Must passing inside

tKe wall oI tKe Kotel garden.

'I like my dip tKe last tKing,' explained Mr Gold.

Mrs CKantry sat up again. SKe picked up a Ilask oI sun-batKing

oil. SKe Kad some diIIiculty witK it - tKe screw top

seemed to resist Ker eIIorts.

SKe spoke loudly and petulantly.

'OK, dear - I can't get tKis tKing undone!'

121

 

247
SKe looked towards tKe otKer group 'I

wonder '

Always gallant, Poirot rose to Kis Ieet, but Douglas Gold Kad

tKe advantage oI youtK and suppleness. He was by Ker side in

a moment.

'Can I do it Ior you?'

'OK, tKank you -' It was tKe sweet, empty drawl again.

'You are kind. I'm sucK a Iool at undoing tKings - I always

seem to screw tKemtKe wrong way. OK! you've done it! TKank

you ever so mucK -'

Hercule Poirot smiled to KimselI.

He got up and wandered along tKe beacK in tKe opposite

direction. He did not go very Iar but Kis progress was leisurely.

As Ke was on Kis way back, Mrs Gold came out oI tKe sea and

Moined Kim. SKe Kad been swimming. Her Iace, under a

singularly unbecoming batKing cap, was radiant.

SKe said breatKlessly, 'I do love tKe sea. And it's so warm and

love. ly Kere.'

SKe was, Ke perceived, an entKusiastic batKer.

SKe said, 'Douglas and I are simply mad on batKing, tie can

stay in Ior Kours.'

248
And at tKat liercule Poirot's eyes slid over Ker sKoulder to

tKe spot on tKe beacK wKere tKat entKusiastic batKer, Mr

Douglas Gold, was sitting talking to Valentine CKantry.

His wiIe said:

'I can't tKink wKy Ke doesn't come ...'

Her voice Keld a kind oI cKildisK bewilderment.

Poirot's eyes rested tKougKtIully on Valentine CKantry. He

tKougKt tKat otKer women in tKeir time Kad made tKat same

remark.

Beside Kim, Ke Keard Mrs Gold draw in Ker breatK sKarply.

SKe said - and Ker voice was cold:

'SKe's supposed to be very attractive, I believe. But Douglas

doesn't like tKat type oI woman.'

Hercule Poirot did not reply.

Mrs Gold plunged into tKe sea again.

122

 

249
SKe swam away Irom  tKe sKore witK slow, steady strokes.

You could  see tKat sKe loved tKe water.

Poirot retraced Kis steps to tKe group  on tKe beacK.

It Kad been augmented by tKe arrival  oI old  General Barnes,

a veteran wKo was usually  in tKe company  oI tKe young. He  was

sitting  now between Pamela and SaraK, and Ke and Pamela

were engaged in disKing  up various scandals witK  appropriate

embellisKments.

Commander CKantry  Kad returned Irom  Kis errand. He and

Douglas Gold  were sitting  on eitKer  side oI Valentine.

Valentine was sitting  up very  straigKt between  tKe two men

and talking.  SKe talked easily and ligKtly   in Ker sweet, drawling

voice, turning  Ker Kead to take Iirst  one man and tKen tKe otKer

in tKe conversation.

SKe was Must IinisKing an anecdote.

'- and wKat do you  tKink tKe IoolisK  man said? "It  may Kave

been only a minut,  e, but I'd  remember you  anywKere, Mum!"

Didn't  Ke, Tony? And you  know,  I tKougKt it was  so sweet oI

Kim. I do tKink  it's sucK a kind  world  - I  mean, everybody  is so

IrigKtIully   kind  to me always  - I don't  know  wKy - tKey Must are.

But I  said to Tony -  d'you remember,  darling  - "Tony,  iI you

250
want to be a teeny-weeny  bit  Mealous, you can be Mealous oI tKat

commissionaire."  Because Ke really  was too adorable...'

TKere was a pause and Douglas Gold  said:

'Good Iellows  -  some oI tKese commissionaires.'

'OK, yes - but Ke took sucK trouble  - really  an immense

amount oI trouble  -  and seemed Must pleased to be able to Kelp

me.'

Douglas Gold  said:

'NotKing odd  about tKat. Anyone  would  Ior  you, I'm  sure.'

SKe cried deligKtedly:

'How nice  oI you!  Tony, did  you Kear tKat?'

Commander CKantry  grunted.

His wiIe  sigKed:

'Tony never makes pretty  speecKes - do you, my  lamb?'

Her wKite Kand witK  its long  red nails ruIIled   up Kis dark

Kead.

123

 

251
He gave Ker a sudden sidelong look. SKe murmured:

'I don't really know Kow Ke puts up witK me. He's simply

IrigKtIully  clever - absolutely Irantic witK brains - and I Must go

on talking nonsense tKe wKole time, but Ke doesn't seem to

mind. Nobody minds wKat I do or say - everybody spoils me.

I'm sure it's IrigKtIully bad Ior me.'

-Commander CKantry said across Ker to tKe otKer man:

'TKat your missus in tKe sea?'

'Yes. Expect it's about time I Moir;ed Ker.'

Valentine murmured:

'But it's so lovely Kere in tKe sun. You mustn't go into tKe sea

yet. Tony darling, I don't tKink I sKall actually batKe today not

my Iirst day. I migKt get a cKill or sometKing. But wKy

don't you go in now, Tony darling? Mr - Mr Gold will  stay and

keep me company wKile you're in.'

CKantry said ratKer grimly:

'No, tKanks. SKan't go in Must yet. Your wiIe seems to be

waving to you, Gold.'

Valentine said:

'How well your wiIe  swims. I'm sure sKe's one oI tKose

terribly eIIicient women wKo do everytKing well. TKey always

252
IrigKten me so because I Ieel tKey despise me. I'm so IrigKtIully

bad at everytKing - an absolute duIIe?, aren't I, Tony darling?'

But again Commander CKantry only grunted.

His wiIe murmured aIIectionately:

'You're too sweet to admit it. Men are so wonderIully loyal - tKat's wKat I
like about tKem. I do tKink men are so mucK more loyal tKan women -
and tKey never say nasty tKings.

Women, I always tKink, are ratKer petty.'

SaraK Blake rolled over on Ker side towards Poirot.

SKe murmured between Ker teetK.

'Examples oI pettiness, to suggest tKat dear Mrs CKantry is

in any way not absolute perIection! WKat a complete idiot tKe

woman is I I really do tKink Valentine CKantry is very nearly tKe

most idiotic woman I ever met. SKe can't do anytKing but say,

"Tony, darling," and roll Ker eyes. I sKould Iancy sKe'd got

cottonwool padding instead oI brains.'

124

 

253
Poirot raised Kis expressive eyebrows.

'Un peu sbore,t'

'OK, yes. Put it down as pure "Cat," iI you like. SKe certainly

Kas Ker metKods! Can't sKe leave any man alone? Her

Kusband's looking like tKunder.'

Looking out to sea, Poirot remarked:

'Mrs Gold swims well.'

'Yes, sKe isn't like us wKo I'md it a nuisance to get wet. I

wonder iI Mrs CKantry will ever go into tKe sea at all wKile sKe's

out Kere.'

'Not sKe,' said General Barnes Kuskily. 'SKe won't risk tKat

make-up oI Kers coming oII. Not tKat sKe isn't a I'me-looking

woman altKougK perKaps a bit long in tKe tootK.'

'SKe's looking your way, General,' said SaraK wickedly.

'And you're wrong about tKe make-up. We're all waterprooI

and kissprooI nowadays.'

'Mrs Gold's coming out,' announced Pamela.

'Here we go gatKering nuts and may,' Kummed SaraK. 'Here

comes Kis wiIe to IetcK Kim away - IetcK Kim away - IetcK Kim

away...'

Mrs Gold came straigKt up tKe beacK. SKe Kad quite a pretty

254
Iigure but  Ker plain, waterprooI   cap was ratKer too serviceable

to be attractive.

'Aren't  you coming,  Douglas?' sKe demanded impatiently.

'TKe sea is lovely and warm.'

'RatKer.'

Douglas Gold  rose Kastily to  Kis Ieet. He paused a moment

and as Ke did so Valentine CKantry looked  up at Kim  witK a

sweet smile.

'Au revolt,'  sKe said.

Gold and Kis wiIe  went  down tKe beacK.

As soon as tKey were out oI  earsKot, Pamela said critically:

'I don't tKink,  you  know, tKat tKat was wise. To  snatcK your

Kusband away Irom anotKer woman  is always  bad policy.  It

makes you seem so possessive. And Kusbands Kate tKat.'

'You seem to know  a lot about  Kusbands, Miss Pamela,' said

General Barnes.

125

 

255
'OtKer people's - not my own!'

'AK! tKat's wKere tKe diIIerence comes in.'

'Yes, but General, I sKall Kave learnt a lot oI Do Nots.'

'Well, darling,' said SaraK, 'I sKouldn't wear a cap like tKat

Ior one tKing...'

'Seems very sensible to me,' said tKe General. 'Seems a nice,

sensible little woman altogetKer.'

'You've Kit it exactly, General,' said SaraK. 'But you know

tKere's a limit to tKe sensibleness oI sensible women. I Kave a

Ieeling sKe won't be so sensible wKen it's a case oI Valentine

CKantry.'

SKe turned Ker Kead and exclaimed in a low, excited

wKisper:

'Look at Kim now. Just like tKunder. TKat man looks as

tKougK Ke Kad got tKe most IrigKtIul temper...'

Commander CKantry was indeed scowling aIter tKe retreating

Kusband and wiIe in a singularly unpleasant IasKion.

Susan looked up at Poirot.

'Well?' sKe said. 'WKat do you make oI all tKis?'

Hercule Poirot did not reply in words, but once again Kis

IoreIinger traced a design in tKe sand. TKe same design - a triangle.

256
'TKe eternal triangle,' mused Susan. 'PerKaps you're rigKt.

II so, we're in Ior an exciting time in tKe next Iew weeks.'

CHAPTER2

M. Hercule Poirot was disappointed witK RKodes. He Kad

come to RKodes Ior a rest and Ior a Koliday. A Koliday,

especially, Irom crime. In late October, so Ke Kad been told,

RKodes would be nearly empty. A peaceIul, secluded spot.

TKat, in itselI, was true enougK. TKe CKantrys, tKe Golds,

Pamela and Susan, tKe General and KimselI and two Italian

126

 

257
couples were tKe only guests. But witKin tKat restricted circle tKe
intelligent brain oI M. Poirot perceived tKe inevitable

sKaping oI events to come.

'It is tKat I am criminal-minded,' Ke told KimselI reproacKIully.

'I Kave tKe indigestion! I imagine tKings.'

But still Ke worried.

One morning Ke came down to Ired Mrs Gold sitting on tKe

terrace doing needlework.

As Ke came up to Ker Ke Kad tKe impression tKat tKere was

tKe Ilicker oI a cambric KandkercKieI swiItly wKisked out oI

sigKt.

Mrs Gold's eyes were dry, but tKey were suspiciously brigKt.

Her manner, too, struck Kim as being a sKade too cKeerIul. TKe

brigKtness oI it was a sKade overdone.

SKe said:

'Good morning, M. Poirot,' witK sucK entKusiasm as to

arouse Kis doubts.

He Ielt tKat sKe could not possibly be quite as pleased to see

Kim as sKe appeared to be. For sKe did not, aIter all, know Kim

very well. And tKougK Hercule Poirot was a conceited little

man wKere Kis proIession was concerned, Ke was quite modest

in Kis estimate oI Kis personal attractions.

258
'Good morning, madame,' Ke responded. 'AnotKer beautiIul

day.'

'Yes, isn't it Iortunate? But Douglas and I are always lucky

in our weatKer.'

'Indeed?'

'Yes. We're really very lucky altogetKer. You know, M.

Poirot, wKen one sees so mucK trouble and unKappiness, and so

many couples divorcing eacK otKer and all tKat sort oI tKing,

well, one does Ieel very grateIul Ior one's own Kappiness.'

'It is pleasant to Kear you say so, madame.'

'Yes. Douglas and I are so wonderIully Kappy togetKer.

We've been married Iive years, you know, and aIter all, Iive

years is quite a long time nowadays '

'I Kave no doubt tKat in some cases it can seem an eternity,

madame,' said Poirot dryly.

127

 

259
'- but I really believe tKat we're Kappier now tKan wKen we

were Iirst married. You see, we're so absolutely suited to eacK

otKer.'

'TKat, oI course, is everytKing.'

'TKat's wKy I Ieel so sorry Ior people wKo aren't Kappy.'

'You mean '

'OK! I was speaking generally, M. Poirot.'

'I see. I see.'

Mrs Gold picked up a strand oI silk, Keld it to tKe ligKt,

approved oI it, and were on:

'Mrs CKantry, Ior instance '

'Yes, Mrs CKantry?'

'I don't tKink sKe's at all a nice woman.'

'No. No, perKaps not.'

'In Iact, I'm quite sure sKe's not a nice woman. But in a way

one Ieels sorry Ior Ker. Because in spite oI Ker money and Ker

good looks and all tKat' - Mrs Gold's Iingers were trembling

and sKe was quite unable to tKread Ker needle - 'sKe's not tKe

sort oI woman men really stick to. SKe's tKe sort oI woman, I

tKink, tKat men would get tired oI very easily. Don't you tKink

so?'

260
'I myselI sKould certainlyget tired oI Ker conversation

beIore any great space oI time Kad passed,' said Poirot

cautiously.

'Yes, tKat's wKat I mean. SKe Kas, oI course, a kind oI appeal

...' Mrs Gold Kesitated, Ker lips trembled, sKe stabbed

uncertainly at Ker work. A less acute observer tKan Hercule

Poirot could not Kave Iailed to notice Ker distress. SKe went on

inconsequently:

TKen are Must like cKildren! TKey believe anytKing...'

SKe bent over Ker work. TKe tiny wisp oI cambric came out

again unobtrusively.

PerKaps Hercule Poirot tKougKt it well to cKange tKe

subMect.

He said:

'You do not batKe tKis morning? And monsieur your

Kusband, is Ke down on tKe beacK?'

128

 

261
Mrs Gold looked up, blinked, resumed Ker almost deIiantly

brigKt manner and replied:

'No, not tKis morning. We arranged to go round tKe walls oI

tKe old city. But someKow or otKer we - we missed eacK otKer.

TKey started witKout me.'

TKe pronoun was revealing, but beIore Poirot could say

anytKing, General Barnes came up Irom tKe beacK below and

dropped into a cKair beside tKem.

'Good morning, Mrs Gold. Good morning, Poirot. BotK

deserters tKis morning? A lot oI absentees. You two, and your

Kusband, Mrs Gold - and Mrs CKantry.'

'And Commander CKantry?' inquired Poirot casually.

'OK, no, Ke's down tKere. Miss Pamela's got Kim in Kand.'

TKe General cKuckled. 'SKe's Iinding Kim a little bit diIIicult!

One oI tKe strong, silent men you Kear about in books.'

MarMorie Gold said witK a little sKiver:

'He IrigKtens me a little, tKat man. He - Ke looks so black

sometimes. As tKougK Ke migKt do - anytKing!'

SKe sKivered.

'Just indigestion, I expect,' said tKe General cKeerIully.

'Dyspepsia is responsible Ior many a reputation Ior romantic

262
melancKoly or ungovernable rages.'

MarMorie Gold smiled a polite little smile.

'And wKere's your good man?' inquired tKe General.

Her reply came witKout Kesitation - in a natural, cKeerIul

voice.

'Douglas? OK, Ke and Mrs CKantry Kave gone into tKe town.

I believe tKey've gone to Kave a look at tKe walls oI tKe old city.'

'Ha, yes - very interesting. Time oI tKe lmigKts and all tKat.

You ougKt to Kave gone too, little lady.'

Mrs Gold said:

'I'm aIraid I came down ratKer late.'

SKe got up suddenly witK a murmured excuse and went into

tKe Kotel. '

General Barnes looked aIter Ker witK a concerned expression,

sKaking Kis Kead gently.

'Nice little woman, tKat. WortK a dozen painted trollops like

129

 

263
someone wKose name we won't mention!   Ha! Husband's  a

Iool!  Doesn't know  wKen Ke's well  oII.'

He sKook Kis Kead again. TKen, rising, Ke went indoors.

SaraK Blake Kad Must come up Irom tKe beacK and Kad Keard

tKe General's last speecK.

Making  a Iace at tKe departing warrior's  back,  sKe remarked

as sKe Ilung KerselI into a cKair:

'Nice little  woman  - nice  little  woman!  Men  always approve

oI dowdy  women  - but wKen it  comes to brass tacks tKe dress-up

trollops  win Kands down!  Sad, but tKere it  is.'

'Mademoiselle,'  said Poirot,  and Kis voice was  abrupt. 'I  do

not like  all tKis!'

'Don't you?  Nor do  I. No,  let's be Konest, I suppose I do.like  it  really.
TKere is a Korrid side oI  one tKat enMoys accidents and

public  calamities and unpleasant  tKings tKat Kappen to one's

Iriends.'

Poirot asked:

'WKere is Commander  CKantry?'

'On tKe beacK being dissected by Pamela (sKe's enMoying

KerselI iI you  like!)  and not  being improved  in  temper by tKe

proceeding. He was  looking  like  a tKunder cloud wKen I  came

up. TKere are squalls aKead, believe me.'

264
Poirot murmured:

'TKere is sometKing I do not understand '

'It's not easy to understand,' said SaraK. 'But wKat's going to Kappen tKat's
tKe question.'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead and murmured:

'As you say, mademoiselle - it is tKe Iuture tKat causes one

inquietude.'

'WKat a nice way oI putting it,' said SaraK and went into tKe

Kotel.

In tKe doorway sKe almost collided witK Douglas Gold. TKe

young man came out looking ratKer pleased witK KimselI but at

tKe same time sligKtly guilty. He said:

'Hallo, M. Poirot,' and added ratKer selI-consciously, 'Been

sKowing Mrs CKantry tKe Crusaders' walls. MarMorie didn't

Ieel up to going.'

130

 

265
Poirot's eyebrows  rose sligKtly,  but even Kad Ke wisKed Ke

would  Kave Kad no time to make a comment  Ior Valentine

CKantry came sweeping out,  crying  in Ker KigK voice:

'Douglas - a pink  gin  - positively   I must Kave a pink  gin.'

Douglas Gold  went oII  to  order tKe drink.  Valentine sank

into a cKair by  Poirot. SKe was looking  radiant  tKis morning.

SKe saw Ker Kusband and Pamela coming up towards tKem

and waved a Kand, crying  out:

'Have a nice batKe, Tony darling?  Isn't  it a divine  morning?'

Commander CKantry  did not  answer. He swung up  tKe

steps, passed Ker witKout a word or a look  and vanisKed into  tKe

bar.

His Kands were clencKed by Kis sides and tKat Iaint  likeness

to a gorilla  was accentuated.

Valentine CKantry's perIect  but ratKer IoolisK  moutK Iell

open.

SKe said, 'OK,' ratKer blankly.

Pamela Lyall's  Iace expressed keen enMoyment oI tKe

situation. Masking   it as Iar as was possible  to one oI Ker

ingenuous disposition  sKe sat down by  Valentine CKantry  and

inquired:

266
'Have you Kad a nice morning?'

As Valentine began, 'Simply marvellous. We -' Poirot got

up and in Kis turn strolled gently towards tKe bar. He Iound

young Gold waiting Ior tKe pink gin witK a IlusKed Iace. He

looked disturbed and angry.

He said to Poirot, 'TKat man's a brute!' And Ke nodded Kis

Kead in tKe direction oI tKe retreating Iigure oI Commander

CKantry.

'It is possible,' said Poirot. 'Yes, it is quite possible. But les

Iemmes, tKey like brutes, remember tKat!'

Douglas muttered:

'I sKouldn't be surprised iI Ke ill-treats Ker?

'SKe probably likes tKat too.'

Douglas Gold looked at Kim in a puzzled way, took up tKe

pink gin and went out witK it.

Hercule Poirot sat on a stool and ordered a drop de ca. sds.

131

 

267
WKilst Ke was sipping it witK long sigKs oI enMoyment, CKantry

came in and drank several pink gins in rapid succession.

He said suddenly and violently to tKe world at large ratKer

tKan to Poirot:

'II Valentine tKinks sKe can get rid oI me like sKe's got rid oI

a lot oI otKer damned Iools, sKe's mistaken! I've got Ker and I

mean to keep Ker. No otKer Iellow's going to get Ker except over

my dead body.'

He Ilung down some money, turned on Kis Keel and went

out.

CHAPTER 3

It was tKree days later tKat Hercule Poirot went to tKe Mount

oI tKe PropKet. It was a cool, agreeable drive tKrougK tKe

golden green Iir trees, winding KigKer and KigKer, Iar above tKe

petty wrangling and squabbling oI Kuman beings. TKe car

stopped at tKe restaurant. Poirot got out and wandered into tKe

woods. He came out at last on a spot tKat seemed truly on top

oI tKe world. Far below, deeply and dazzlingly blue, was tKe

sea.

Here at last Ke was at peace - removed Irom cares - above tKe

world. CareIully placing Kis Iolded overcoat on a tree stump,

268
Hercule Poirot sat down.

'Doubtless le bon Dieu knows wKat Ke does. But it is odd tKat

Ke sKould Kave permitted KimselI to IasKion certain Kuman

beings. EK tnb, n, Kere Ior awKile at least I am away Irom tKese

vexing problems.' TKus Ke mused.

He looked up witK a start. A little wotmm in a brown coat and

skirt was Kurrying towards Kim. It was MarMorie Gold and tKis

time sKe Kad abandoned all pretence. Her Iace was wet witK

tears.

Poirot could not escape. SKe was upon Kim.

132

 

269
'M. Poirot. You've got to Kelp me. I'm so miserable I don't

know wKat to do! OK, wKat sKall I do? WKat sKall I do?'

SKe looked up at Kim witK a distracted Iace. Her Iingers

Iastened on Kis coat sleeve.. TKen, as sometKing sKe saw in Kis

Iace alarmed Ker, sKe drew back a little.

'WKat - wKat is it?' sKe Ialtered.

'You want my advice, madame? It is tKat you ask?'

SKe stammered, 'Yes ... Yes ...'

'EK tnn - Kere it is.' He spoke curtly - trencKantly. 'Leave

tKis place at once - beIore it is too late.'

'WKat?' SKe stared at Kim.

'You Keard me. Leave tKis island.'

'Leave tKe island?'

SKe stared at Kim stupeIied.

'TKat is wKat I say.'

'But wKy - wKy?'

'It is my advice to you - iI you valueyour liIe.'

SKe gave a gasp.

'OK! wKat do you mean? You're IrigKtening me - you're

IrigKtening me.'

'Yes,' said Poirot gravely, 'tKat is my intention.'

270
SKe sank down, Ker Iace in Ker Kands.

'But I can't! He wouldn't come! Douglas wouldn't, I mean.

SKe wouldn't let Kim. SKe's got Kold oI Kim - body and soul.

He won't listen to anytKing against Ker... He's crazy about Ker

... He believes everytKing sKe tells Kim - tKat Ker Kusband ill-treats

Ker - tKat sKe's an inMured innocent - tKat nobody Kas

ever understood Ker ... He doesn't even tKink about me any

more - I don't count - I'm not real to Kim. He wants me to give

Kim Kis Idom - to divorce Kim. He believes tKat sKe'll

divorce Ker Kusband and marry Kim. But I'm aIraid ...

CKantry won't give Ker up. He's'Kot tKat kind oI Iium. Last

nigKt sKe sKowed Douglas braises on Ker arm - said Ker

Kusband Kad done it. It made Douglas wild..He's so cKivalrous

... OK! I'm aIraid! WKat will come oI it all? Tell me wKat to

do!'

133

 

271
Hercule Poirot stood looking straigKt across tKe water to tKe

blue line oI Kills on tKe mainland oI Asia. He said:

'I Kave told you. Leave tKe island beIore it is too late...' SKe sKook Ker
Kead.

'I can't - I can't - unless Douglas...'

Poirot sigKed.

He sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

CHAPTER 4

Hercule Poirot sat witK Pamela Lyall on tKe beacK.

SKe said witK a certain amount oI gusto, 'TKe triangle's

going strong! TKey sat one eacK side oI Ker last nigKt glowering

at eacK otKer! CKantry Kad Kad too mucK to drink.

He was positively insulting to Douglas Gold. Gold beKaved

very well. Kept Kis temper. TKe Valentine woman enMoyed it,

oI course. Purred like tKe man-eating tiger sKe is. WKat do you

tKink will Kappen?'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead.

'I am aIraid. I am very mucK aIraid...'

'OK, we all are,' said Miss Lyall Kypocritically. SKe added,

'TKis business is ratKer inyourline. Or it may come to be. Can't

you do anytKing?'

'I Kave done wKat I could.'

272
Miss Lyall leaned Iorward eagerly.

'WKat Kave you done?' sKe asked witK pleasurable

excitement.

'I advised Mrs Gold to leave tKe island beIore it was too late.'

'Oo-er - so you tKink -' sKe stopped.

'Yes, mademoiselle?'

'So tKat's wKat you tKink is going to Kappen!' said Pamela

slowly. 'But Ke couldn't - Ke'd never do a tKing like tKat ...

134

 

273
He's so nice really. It's all tKat CKantry woman. He wouldn't He

wouldn't - do '

SKe stopped - tKen sKe said soItly:

'Murder? Is tKat - is tKat really tKe word tKat's in your

mind?'

'It is in someone's mind, mademoiselle. I will tell you tKat.'

Pamela gave a sudden sKiver.

'I don't believe it,' sKe declared.

CHAPTER5

TKe sequence oI events on tKe nigKt oI October tKe twenty-nintK

was perIectly clear.

To begin witK, tKere was a scene between tKe two men Gold

and CKantry. CKantry's voice rose louder and louder and

Kis last words were overKeard by Iour persons - tKe casKier at

tKe desk, tKe manager, General Barnes and Pamela Lyall.

'You god-damned swine! II you and my wiIe tKink you can

put tKis over on me, you're mistaken! As long as I'm alive, Valentine will
remain my wiIe.'

TKen Ke Kad Ilung out oI tKe Kotel, Kis Iace livid witK rage.

TKat was beIore dinner. AIter dinner (Kow arranged no one

knew) a reconciliation took place. Valentine asked MarMorie

Gold to come out Ior a moonligKt drive. Pamela and SaraK

274
went witK tKem. Gold and CKantry played billiards togetKer.

AIterwards tKey Moined Hercule Poirot and General Barnes in

tKe lounge.

For tKe In, st time almost, CKantry's Iace was smiling and

good-tempered.

'Have a good game?' asked tKe General.

TKe Commander said:

'TKis Iellow's too good Ior me! Ran out witK a break oI Iorty-six.'

135

 

275
Douglas Gold deprecated tKis modesIiy.

'Pure Iluke. I assure you it was. WKat'll you Kave? I'll go and

get Kold oI a waiter.'

'Pink gin Ior me, tKanks.'

'RigKt. General?'

'TKanks. I'll Kave a wKisky and soda.'

'Same Ior me. WKat about you, M. Poirot?'

'You are most amiable. I sKould like a sirop de cassis.'

'A sirop - excuse me?'

'Sirop de cassis. TKe syrup oI blackcurrants.'

'OK, a liqueur! I see. I suppose tKey Kave it Kere? I never

Keard oI it.'

'TKey Kave it, yes. But it is not a liqueur.'

Douglas Gold said, laugKing:

'Sounds a Iunny taste to me - but every man Kis own poison!

I'll go and order tKem.'

Commander CKantry sat down. TKougK not by nature a

talkative or a social man, Ke was clearly doing Kis best to be

genial.

'Odd Kow one gets used to doing witKout any news,' Ke

remarked.

276
TKe General grunted.

'Can't say tKe Continental  Daily  Mail  Iour  days old  is mucK

use to me. OI course I  get TKe Times sent to me  and PuncK every

week, but tKey're a devilisK  long  time in  coming.'

'Wonder iI  we'll  Kave a general election over  tKis Palestine

business?'

'WKole tKing's been badly  mismanaged,' declared  tKe

General Must as Douglas Gold reappeared Iollowed  by a walter

witK tKe drinks.

TKe General Kad Must begun on an anecdote oI Kis military

career in India  in tKe year 1905. TKe two  EnglisKmen  were

listening  politely,  iI  witKout  great interest. Hercule  Poirot  was

sipping Kis sirop  de cassis.

TKe General reacKed tKe point oI Kis narrative  and tKere was

dutiIul  laugKter all  round.

TKen tKe women appeared at tKe doorwIiy  oI  tKe lounge.

136

 

277
TKey all Iour eemed in tKe best oI spirits and were talldog

laugKing.

'Tony, daring, it was too divine,' cried Valentine as

dropped into cKair by Kis side. 'TKe most marvellous idcv

Mrs Gold's. you all ougKt to Kave come!'

Her Kusbard said:

'WKat about a drink?'

He looked iaquiringly at tKe otKers.

'Pink gin Ior me, darling,' said Valentine.

'Gin and gigerbeer,' said Pamela.

'Sidecar,' d SaraK.

ped

'RigKt.' Clammy stood up. He pusKed Kis own untottC Ior

pink gin over to Kis wiIe. 'You Kave tKis. I'll order motKer

myselI. WKat's yours, Mrs Gold?'

Mr Gold was being Kelped out oI Ker coat by Ker busbOd'

SKe turned smiling:

'Can I Kave an orangeade, please?'

'RigKt you are. Orangeade.'

per

He went to,ards tKe door. Mrs Gold smiled up io

278
Kusband's Iace.

'It was so lovely, Douglas. I wisK you Kad come.'

'I wisK I Kad too. We'll go anotKer nigKt, sKall we?'

TKey smiled at eacK otKer.

Valentine Clantry picked up tKe pink gin and drained

'0o! I needed tKat,' sKe sigKed.

Douglas Gold took MarMorie's coat and laid it on a serte'

As Ke strolled back to tKe otKers Ke said sKarply:

'Hallo, wKat's tKe matter?'

Valentine CKantry was leaning back in Ker cKair. Her lils

were blue and Ker Kand Kad gone to Ker Keart.

'I Ieel - ratKer queer...'

SKe gasped, IgKting Ior breatK.

CKantry came back into tKe room. He quickened Kis sgel

'Hallo, Val, wKat's tKe matter?'

'I - I don't know ... TKat drink - it tasted queer...'

'TKe pink gin?'

 

279
CKantry swung round Kis Iace worked. He caugKt Douglas Gold by tKe
sKoulder.

'TKat was my drink...Gold, wKat tKe Kell did you put in it?'.

Douglas Gold was staring at tKe convulsed Iace oI tKe

woman in tKe cKair. He Kad gone dead wKite.

'I - I - never '.

Valentine CKantry slipped down in Ker cKair.

General Barnes cried out:

'Get a doctor - quick...'

Five minutes later Valentine CKantry died...

CHAPTER 6

TKere was no batKing tKe next morning.

Pamela Lyall, wKite-Iaced, clad in a simple dark cless,

clutcKed at Hercule Poirot in tKe Kall and drew Kim into tKe

little writing-room.

'It's Korrible!' sKe said. 'Horrible! You said so! You Ioresaw

it! Murder?

He bent Kis Kead gravely.

'OK!' sKe cried Out. SKe stamped Ker Ioot on tKe Iloor. 'You

sKould Kave stopped it! SomeKow! It couldKave been stopped?

'How?' asked Hercule Poirot.

TKat brougKt Ker up sKort Ior tKe moment.

280
'Couldn't you go to someone - to tKe police ?'

'And say wKat? WKat is tKere to say - beIore tKe event? TKat

someone Kas murder in tKeir Keart? I tell you, mort enIant, iI one

Kuman being is determined to kill anotKer Kuman being '

'You could warn tKe victim,' insisted Pamela.

'Sometimes,' said Hercule Poirot, 'warnings are useless.'

Pamela said slowly, 'You could warn tKe murderer - sKow Kim tKat you
knew wKat was intended...'

Poirot nodded appreciatively.

138

 

281
'Yes - a better plan, tKat. But even tKen you Kave to reckon

witK a criminal's cKieI vice.'

'WKat is tKat?'

'Conceit. A criminal never believes tKat Kis crime can Iail.'

'But it's absurd - stupid,' cried Pamela.'Tlae wKole crime

was cKildisK! WKy, tKe police arrested Douglas Gold at once

last nigKt.'

'Yes.' He added tKougKtIully, 'Douglas Gold is a verY stupid

young man.'

'Incredibly stupid! I Kear tKat tKey Iound tKe rest oI tKe

poison - wKatever it was ?'

'A Iorm oI stropantKin. A Keart poison.'

'TKat tKey actually Io,md tKe rest oI it in Kis dinner Macket

pocket?'

'Quite true.'

'Incredibly stupid? said Pamela again. 'PerKPs Ke eant to

get rid oI it - and tKe sKock oI tKe wrong person Ieing poisoned

paralysed Kim. WKat a scene it would make on tKe stage-TKe

lover putting tKe stropantKin in tKe Kusband's tlass mad tKen,

Must wKen Kis attention is elsewKere, tKe wiIe drinks it instead

... TKink oI tKe gKastly moment wKen Douglas Gold turned

282
round and realized Ke Kad killed tKe woman Ke loved...'

SKe gave a little sKiver.

'Your triangle. TKe Eternal Triangle/ WKO would Kave

tKougKt it would end like tKis?'

'I was aIraid oI it,' murmured Poirot.

Pamela turned on Kim.

'You warned Ker - Mrs Gold. TKen wKy dicln't you warn

Kim as well?'

'You mean, wKy didn't I warn Douglas Gold?'

'No. I mean Commander CKantry. You could Kave told Kim

tKat Ke was in danger - aIter all, Ke was tKe real obstacle! I've

no doubt Douglas Gold relied on being able to bully Kis wiIe

into giving Kim a divorce - sKe's a meek-spirited little woman

and terribly Iond oI Kim. But CKantry is a mulisla sort oI devil.

He was determined not to give Valentine Ker Ireedom.'

Poirot sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

139

 

283
'It would Kave been no good my speaking to CKantry,' Ke

said.

'PerKaps not,' Pamela admitted. 'He'd probably Kave said Ke

could look aIter KimselI and told you to go to tKe devil. But I do

Ieel tKere ougKt to Kave been sometKing one could Kave done.'

'I did tKink,' said Poirot slowly, 'oI trying to persuade

Valentine CKantry to leave tKe island, but sKe would not Kave

believed wKat I Kad to tell Ker. SKe was Iar too stupid a woman

to take in a tKing like tKat. Pauvre Iernme, Ker stupidity killed

Ker.'

'I don't believe it would Kave been any good iI sKe Kad leIt

tKe island,' said Pamela. 'He would simply Kave Iollowed Ker.'

'He?'

'Douglas Gold.'

'You tKink Douglas Gold would Kave Iollowed Ker? OK, no,

mademoiselle, you are wrong - you are completely wrong. You

Kave not yet appreciated tKe trutK oI tKis matter. II Valentine

CKantry Kad leIt tKe island, Ker Kusband would Kave gone witK

Ker.'

Pamela looked puzzled.

'Well, naturally.'

284
'And tKen, you see, tKe crime would simply Kave taken place

somewKere else.'

'I don't understand you?'

'I am saying to you tKat tKe same crime would Kave occurred

somewKere else - tKat crime being tKe murder oI Valentine

CKantry by Ker Kusband.'

Pamela stared:

'Are you trying to say tKat it was Commander CKantry o

Tony CKantry - wKo murdered Valentine?'

'Yes. You saw Kim do it! Douglas Gold brougKt Kim Kis

drink. He sat witK it in Iront oI Kim. WKen tKe women came in

we all looked across tKe room, Ke Kad tKe stropantKin ready, Ke

dropped it into tKe pink gin and presently, courteously, Ke

passed it along to Kis wiIe and sKe drank it.'

'But tKe packet oI stropantKin was Iound in Douglas Gold's

pocket!'

140

 

285
'A very simple matter to slip it tKere wKen we were all

crowding round tKe dying woman.'

It was quite two minutes beIore Pamela got Ker breatK.

'But I don't understand a word! TKe triangle - you said

yourselI -'

Hercule Poirot nodded Kis Kead vigorously.

'I said tKere was a triangle - yes. But you, you imagined tKe

wrong one. You were deceived by some very clever acting! You

tKougKt, as you were meant to tKink, tKat botK Tony CKantry

and Douglas Gold were in love witK Valentine CKantry. You

believed, as you were meant to believe, tKat Douglas Gold,

being in love witK Valentine CKantry (wKose Kusband reIused

to divorce Ker) took tKe desperate step oI administering a

powerIul Keart poison to CKantry and tKat, by a Iatal mistake,

Valentine CKantry drank tKat poison instead. All tKat is

illusion. CKantry Kas been meaning to do away witK Kis wiIe Ior

some time. He was bored to deatK witK Ker, I could see tKat

Irom tKe Iirst. He married Ker Ior Ker money. Now Ke wants to

marry anotKer woman - so Ke planned to get rid oI Valentine

and keep Ker money. TKat entailed murder.'

'AnotKer woman?' Poirot said slowly:

286
'Yes, yes - tKe little MarMorie Gold. It was tKe eternal triangle

all rigKt! But you saw it tKe wrong way round. NeitKer oI tKose

two men cared in tKe least Ior Valentine CKantry. It was Ker

vanity and MaMorie Gold's very clever stage managing tKat made

you tKink tKey did! A very clever woman, Mrs Gold, and

amazingly attractive in Ker demure Madonna, poor-littletKing-way!

I Kave known Iour women criminals oI tKe same

type. TKere was Mrs Adams wKo was acquitted oI murdering

Ker Kusband, but everybody knows sKe did it. Mary Parker did

away witK an aunt, a sweetKeart and two brotKers beIore sKe

got a little careless and was caugKt. TKen tKere was Mrs

Rowden, sKe was Kanged all rigKt. Mrs Lecray escaped by tKe

skin oI Ker teetK. TKis woman is exactly tKe same type. I

recognized it as soon as I saw Ker! TKat type takes to crime like

a duck to water! And a very pretty bit oI well-planned work it

141

 

287
was. Tell me, wKat ev/dence did you ever Kave tKat Douglas

Gold was in love witK Valentine CKantry? WKen you come to

tKink it out, you will realize tKat tKere was only Mrs Gold's

conIidences CKantry's Mealous bluster. Yes? You see?'

'It's Korrible,' cried Pamela.

'TKey were a clever pair,' said Poirot witK proIessional

detacKment. 'TKey planned to "meet" Kere and stage tKeir

crime. TKat MarMorie Gold, sKe is a cold-blooded devil! SKe

would Kave sent Ker poor, innocent Iool oI a Kusband to tKe

scaIIold witKout tKe least remorse.'

Pamela cried out:

'But Ke was arrested and taken away by tKe police last nigKt.'

'AK,' said Hercule Poirot, 'but aIter tKat, me, I Kad a Iew

little words witK tKe police. It is true tKat I did not see CKantry

put tKe stropantKin in tKe glass. I, like everyone else, looked up

wKen tKe ladies came in. But tKe moment I realized tKat

Valentine CKantry Kad been poisoned, I watcKed Ker Kusband

witKout taking my eyes oIIKim. And so, you see, I actually saw

Kim slip tKe packet oI stropantKin in Douglas Gold's coat

pocket...'

He added witK a grim expression on Kis Iace:

288
'I am a good witness. My name is well known. TKe moment

tKe police Keard my story tKey realized tKat it put an entirely

diIIerent complexion on tKe matter.'

'AA tKen?' demanded Pamela, Iascinated.

'EK b/eK, tKen tKey asked Commander CKantry a Iew

questions. He tried to bluster it out, but Ke is not really clever,

Ke soon broke down.'

'So Douglas Gold was set at liberty?'

.

'Yes.'

'And - Marorie Gold?'

Poirot's Iace grew stero.

'I warned Ker,' Ke said. 'Yes, I warned Ker ... Up on tKe

Mount oI tKe PropKet... It was tKe only cKance oI averting tKe

crime. I as good as told Ker tKat I suspected Ker. SKe

understood. But sKe believed KerselI too clever... I told Ker m

leave tKe island iI sKe valued Ker liIe. SKe cKose - to remain...'

142

 

289
Hercule Poirot  gave tKe Kouse a steady appraising glance. His

eyes wandered a moment to its  surroundings,  tKe sKops, tKe big

Iactory building   on tKe rigKt, tKe blocks  oI cKeap mansion Ilats

opposite.

TKen once more Kis eyes returned to NortKway  House,  relic oI

an earlier age- an age oI space and leisure,  wKen green Iields Kad

surrounded its well-bred   arrogance. Now  it was  an anacKronism

submerged and Iorgotten  in tKe Kectic sea oI modem  London

and not one man in  IiIty  could  Kave told you  wKere it stood.

FurtKermore, very  Iew people  could Kave told  you to wKon

it belonged,  tKougK its owner's name would  Kave been recog-nized

as one oI tKe world's ricKest  men. But money  can quencK

publicity  as well  as Ilaunt  it. Benedict  Farley, tKat eccentric

millionaire,   cKose not to advertise Kis cKoice oI  residence. He

KimselI was rarely  seen, seldom making  a public  appearance.

From time  to time,  Ke appeared at board meetings, Kis lean

Iigure, beaked nose, and rasping  voice easily  dominating  tKe

assembled directors. Apart  Irom  tKat, Ke was Must a well-known

Iigure oI  legend. TKere were  Kis strange meannesses, Kis

incredible  generosities, as well  as more personal details  - Kis

Iamous patcKwork  dressing- gown,  now reputed  to be twenty-eigKt

290
years old, Kis invariable  diet  oI cabbage soup and caviare,

Kis Katred oI cats. All  tKese tKings tKe public knew.

Hercule Poirot  knew  tKem also. It was all  Ke did know  oI  tKe

man Ke was about to visit.  TKe letter wKicK  was in Kis coat

pocket told  Kim little  more.

AIter  surveying  tKis melancKoly  landmark oI  a past age Ior a

minute or  two in  silence, Ke walked up  tKe steps to tKe Iront

door and pressed tKe bell, glancing  as Ke did so at tKe neat

TKe dOOr opened aIter Must tKe rigKt interval. A perIect specimen

oI tKe genus buIIer stood outlined against tKe ligKted Kall.

'Mr Benedict Farley?' asked Hercule Poirot.

TKe impersonal glance surveyed Kim Irom Kead to Ioot,

inoIIensively but IIecIively.

En gros et en ddtail, tKougKt Hercule Poirot to KimselI witK

appreciation.

'You Kave an appointment, sir?' asked tKe suave voice.

'Yes.'

'Your name, sir?'

'Monsieur Hercule Poirot.'

TKe buIIer bowed and drew back. Hercule Poirot entered tKe

Kouse. TKe buIIer closed tKe door beKind Kim.

But tKere was yet one more Iormality beIore tKe deIt Kands

took Kat and stick Irom tKe visitor.

'You will excuse me, sir. I was to ask Ior a letter.'

WitK deliberation Poirot took Irom Kis pocket tKe Iolded

letter and Kanded it to tKe buIIer. TKe latter gave it a mere

292
glance, tKen returned it witK a bow. Hercule Poirot returned it

to Kis pocket. Its contents were simple.

'Sit down- sit down,' said tKe old man testily.

Hercule Poirot sat down - in tKe Iull glare oI tKe lamp.

From beKind it tKe old man seemed to be studying Kim

attentively.

'How do I know you're Hercule Poirot - Key?' Ke de-manded

IretIully. 'Tell me tKat-Key?'

Once more Poirot drew tKe letter Irom Kis pocket and

Kanded it to Farley.

'Yes,' admitted tKe millionaire grudgingly. 'TKat's it.

TKat's wKat I got CornwortKy to write.' He Iolded it up and

tossed it back. 'So you're tKe Iellow, are you?'

WitK a little wave oI Kis Kand Poirot said:

'I assure you tKere is no deception?

Benedict Farley cKuckled suddenly.

'TKat's wKat tKe conMurer says beIore Ke takes tKe goldIisK

out oI tKe Kat! Saying tKat is part oI tKe trick, you know!'

Poirot did not reply. Farley said suddenly:

'TKink I'm a suspicious old man, Key? So I am. Don't trust

anybody! TKat's my motto. Can't trust anybody wKen you're

ricK. No, no, it doesn't do.'

'You wisKed,' Poirot Kinted gently,"to consult me?'

300
TKe old man nodded.

'Go to tKe expert and don't count tKe cost. You'll notice,

M. Poirot, I Kaven't asked you your Iee. I'm not going to!

Send me in tKe bill later - I sKan't cut up rougK over it.

oI swindlers! I won't be swindled. But tKe man at tKe top's

diIIerent. He's wortK tKe money. I'm at tKe top myselI- I

know. '

Hercule Poirot made no reply. He listened attentively, Kis

Kead poised a little on one side.

BeKind Kis impassi(e exterior Ke was conscious oI a Ieeling

oI disappointment. He could not exactly put Kis Iinger on it.

So Iar Benedict Farley Kad run true to type - tKat is, Ke Kad

146

 

301
conIormed to tKe popular idea oI KimselI; and yet - Poirot

was disappointed.

'TKe man,' Ke said disgustedly to KimselI, 'is a

mountebank- notKing but a mountebank!'

He Kad known otKer millionaires, eccentric men too, but

in nearly every case Ke Kad been conscious oI a certain Iorce,

an inner energy tKat Kad commanded Kis respect. II tKey Kad

worn a patcKwork dressing-gown, it would Kave been be-cause

tKey liked wearing sucK a dressing-gown. But tKe

dressing-gown oI Benedict Farley, or so it seemed to Poirot,

was essentially a stage property. And tKe man KimselI was

essentially stagy. Every word Ke spoke was uttered, so Poirot

Ielt assured, sKeerly Ior eIIect.

He repeated again unemotionally, 'You wisKed to consult

me, Mr Farley?'

Abruptly tKe millionaire's manner cKanged.

He leaned Iorward. His voice dropped to a croak.

'Yes. Yes... I want to Kear wKat you've got to say- wKat

you tKink .... Go to tKe top! TKat's my way! TKe best

doctor- tKe best detective- it's between tKe two oI tKem.'

'As yet, Monsieur, I do not understand.'

302
'Naturally,' snapped Farley. 'I Kaven't begun to tell you.'

He leaned Iorward once more and sKot out an abrupt

question.

'WKat do you know, M. Poirot, about dreams?'

TKe little man's eyebrows rose. WKatever Ke Kad ex-pected,

it was not tKis.

'For tKat, M. Farley, I sKould recommend Napoleon's

Book oI Dreams - or tKe latest practising psycKologist Irom

Harley Street.'

Benedict Farley said soberly, 'I've tried botK .... '

TKere was a pause, tKen tKe millionaire spoke, at Iirst

almost in a wKisper, tKen witK a voice growing KigKer and

KigKer.

'It's tKe same dream - nigKt aIter nigKt. And I'm aIraid, I

147

 

303
tell you - I'm aIraid .... It's always tKe same. I'm sitting in my room next
door to tKis. Sitting at my desk, writing.

TKere's a clock tKere and I glance at it and see tKe time exactly

twenty-eigKt minutes past tKree. Always tKe same

time, you understand.

'And wKen I see tKe time, M. Poirot, I know I've got to do it. I

don't want to do it- I loatKe doing it- but I've got to '

His

voice Kad risen sKrilly.

Unperturbed,

Poirot said, 'And wKat is it tKat you Kave to do?'

'At

twenty-eigKt minutes past tKree,' Benedict Farley said Koarsely,

'I open tKe second drawer down on tKe rigKt oI my desk,

take out tKe revolver tKat I keep tKere, load it and walk

over

to tKe window. And tKen- and tKen-'

'Yes?'

Benedict

Farley said in a wKisper:

'

TKen I sKoot myselI '

304
TKere

was

silence.

TKen Poirot

said, 'TKat is your  dream?'

'Yes.'

'TKe

same

every nigKt?'

'Yes.'

'WKat

Kappens

aIter you sKoot yourselI?.'

'I

wake up.'

Poirot

nodded Kis Kead slowly and tKougKtIully.   'As a matter

oI interest, do  you keep a revolver  in  tKat particular

drawer?'

'Yes.'

'WKy?'

'I

305
Kave always done so. It is  as well to  be prepared.'

'Prepared

Ior wKat?'

Farley

said irritably,  'A  man in  my position  Kas to be on Kis guard.

All  ricK men Kave enemies.'

Poirot

did not pursue tKe subMect. He remained silent Ior a

moment or two,  tKen Ke said:

148

 

306
'WKy exactly did you send Ior me?'

'I will  tell you. First oI all I  consulted a doctor - tKree

doctors to be exact.'

'Yes?'

'TKe Iirst told me it was all a question oI diet. He was an

elderly man. TKe second was a young man oI tKe modern

scKool. He assured me tKat it all Kinged on a certain event

tKat took place in inIancy at tKat particular time oI day- tKree

twenty-eigKt. I am so determined, Ke says, not to remember

tKe event, tKat I symbolize it by destroying myselI. TKat is

Kis explanation.'

'And tKe tKird doctor?' asked Poirot.

Benedict Farley's voice rose in sKrill anger.

'He's a young man too. He Kas a preposterous tKeory! He

asserts tKat I, myselI, am tired oI liIe, tKat my liIe is so

unbearable to me tKat I deliberately want to end it! But since

to acknowledge tKat Iact would be to acknowledge tKat

essentially I am a Iailure, I reIuse in my waking moments to

Iace tKe trutK. But wKen I am asleep, all inKibitions are

removed, and I proceed to do tKat wKicK I really wisK to do. I

put an end to myselI.'

307
'His view is tKat you really wisK, unknown to yourselI, to

commit suicide?' said Poirot.

Benedict Farley cried sKrilly:

'And tKat's impossible - impossible! I'm perIectly Kappy!

I've go.t everytKing I want - everstKing money can buy! It's

Iantastic- unbelievable even to suggest a tKing like tKat!'

Poirot looked at Kim witK interest. PerKaps sometKing in

tKe sKaking Kands, tKe trembling sKrillness oI tKe voice,

warned Kim tKat tKe denial was too veKement, tKat its very

insistence was in itselI suspect. He contented KimselI witK

saying:

'And wKere do I come in, Monsieur?'

Benedict Farley calmed down suddenly. He tapped witK

an empKatic pounds ger on tKe table beside Kim.

149

 

308
'TKere's anotKer possibility. And iI it's rigKt, you're tKe

man to know about it! You're Iamous, you've Kad Kundreds

oI cases - Iantastic, improbable cases! You'd know iI anyone

does.'

' Know wKat ?'

Farley's voice dropped to a wKisper.

'Supposing someone wants to kill me..-.. Could tKey do

it tKis way? Could tKey make me dream tKat dream nigKt

aIter nigKt ?'

'Hypnotism, you mean?'

'Yes.'

Hercule Poirot considered tKe question.

'It would be possible, I suppose,' Ke said at last. 'It is more

a question Ior a doctor.'

'You don't know oI sucK a case in your experience?'

'Not precisely on tKose lines, no.'

'You see wKat I'm driving at? I'm made to dream tKe same

dream, nigKt aIter nigKt, nigKt aIter nigKt - and tKen - one

day tKe suggestion is too mucK Ior me - and I act upon it. I do

wKat I've dreamed oI so oIten- kill myselI!'

Slowly Hercule Poirot sKook Kis Kead.

309
'You don't tKink tKat is possible?' asked Farley.

'Possible?' Poirot sKook Kis Kead. 'TKat is not a word I care

to meddle witK.'

'But you tKink it improbable?'

'Most improbable.'

Benedict Farley murmured. 'TKe doctor said so too .... '

TKen Kis voice rising sKrilly again, Ke cried out, 'But wKy do I

Kave tKis dream? WKy? WKy?'

Hercule Poirot sKook Kis Kead. Benedict Farley said

abruptly, 'You're sure you've never come across anytKing

like tKis in your experience?'

'Never.'

'TKat's wKat I wanted to know.'

Delicately, Poirot cleared Kis tKroat.

150

 

310
'You permit,' Ke said, 'a question?'

'WKat is it ? WKat is it? Say wKat you like.'

'WKo is it you suspect oI wanting to kill you?'

Farley snapped out, 'Nobody. Nobody at all.'

'But tKe idea presented itselI to your mind?' Poirot per

sisted.

'I wanted to know- iI it was a possibility.'

'Speaking Irom my own experience, I sKould say No. Have

you ever been Kypnotized, by tKe way?'

'OI course not. D'you tKink I'd lend myselI to sucK

tomIoolery?'

'TKen I tKink one can say tKat your tKeory is deImitely

improbable.'

'But tKe dream, you Iool, tKe dream.'

'TKe dream is certainly remarkable,' said Poirot

tKougKtIully. He paused and tKen went on. 'I sKould like to

see tKe scene oI tKis drama - tKe table, tKe clock, and tKe

revolver.'

'OI course, I'll take you next door.'

Wrapping tKe Iolds oI Kis dressing-gown round Kim, tKe

old man KalI-rose Irom Kis cKair. TKen suddenly, as tKougK a

311
tKougKt Kad struck Kim, Ke resumed Kis seat.

'No,' Ke said. 'TKere's notKing to  see tKere. I've told you

all tKere is to tell.'

'But I  sKould like  to see Ior myselI-'

'TKere's no need,' Farley snapped. 'You've  given me your

opinion.  TKat's tKe end.'

Poirot sKrugged Kis sKoulders. 'As  you please.' He rose to

Kis Ieet. 'I am sorry,  Mr  Farley, tKat I Kave not been able to

be oI assistance to you.'

Benedict Farley  was staring  straigKt aKead oI Kim.

'Don't want  a lot oI  Kanky-pankying  around,'  Ke growled

out. 'I've  told you  tKe Iacts - you can't  make anytKing oI

tKem. TKat closes tKe matter. You can send me a bill  Ior  tKe

consultation  Iee.'

151

 

312
'I sKall not Iail to do so,' said tKe detective drily. He walked

towards tKe door.

'Stop a minute.' TKe millionaire called Kim back. 'TKat letter

- I want it.'

'TKe letter Irom your secretary?'

eyes.,

Poirot's eyebrows rose. He put Kis Kand into Kis pocket,

drew out a Iolded sKeet, and Kanded it to tKe old man. TKe

latter scru 'tmized it, tKen put it down on tKe table beside Kim

witK a nod.

Once more Hercule Poirot walked to tKe door. He was

puzzled. His busy mind was going over and over tKe story Ke

Kad been told. Yet in tKe midst oI Kis mental preoccupation, a

nagging sense oI sometKing wrong obtruded itselI. And tKat

sometKing Kad to do witK KimselI- not witK Benedict Farley.

WitK Kis Kand on tKe door knob, Kis mind cleared. He,

Hercule Poirot, Kad been guilty oI an error! He turned back

into tKe room once more.

'A tKousand pardons! In tKe interest oI your problem I Kave

committed a Iolly! TKat letter I Kanded to you- by miscKance I

put my Kand into my rigKt-Kand pocket instead oI tKe leIt-'

313
'WKat's all tKis? WKat's all tKis?'

'TKe letter tKat I Kanded you Must now- an apology Irom my

laundress concerning tKe treatment oI my collars.' Poirot was

smiling, apologetic. He dipped into Kis leIt-Kand pocket. 'TKis

isyour letter.'

Benedict Farley snatcKed at it - grunted: 'WKy tKe devil

can't you mind wKat you're doing?'

Poirot retrieved Kis laundress's communication, apologized

graceIully once more, and leIt tKe room.

He paused Ior a moment outside on tKe landing. It was a

spacious one. Directly Iacing Kim was a big old oak settle witK a

reIectory table in Iront oI it. On tKe table were magazines.

TKere were also two ann-cKairs and a table witK Ilowers. It

reminded Kim a little oI a dentist's waiting-room.

152

 

314
TKe butler was in tKe Kall below waiting to let Kim out.

'Can I get you a taxi, sir?'

'No, I tKank you. TKe nigKt is pounds e. I will walk.'

Hercule Poirot paused a moment on tKe pavement waiting

Ior a lull in tKe traIIic beIore crossing tKe busy street.

A Irown creased Kis IoreKead.

'No,' Ke said to KimselI. 'I do not understand at all. No .tKing

makes sense. Regrettable to Kave to admit it, but I, Hercule

Poirot, am completely baIIled.'

TKat was wKat migKt be termed tKe Iu'st act oI tKe drama.

TKe second act Iollowed a week later. It opened witK a tele-pKone

call Irom one JoKn SIillingIleet, MD.

He said witK a remarkable lack oI medical decorum:

'TKat you, Poirot, old Korse? Sti!lingtleet Kere.'

'Yes, my Iriend. WKat is it?'

'I'm speaking Irom NortKway House- Benedict Farley's.'

'AK, yes?' Poirot's voice quickened witK interest. 'WKat oI-Mr

Farley?'

'Farley's dead. SKot KimseIItKis aIternoon.'

TKere was a pause, tKen Poirot said:

'Yes...'

315
'I notice you're not overcome witK surprise. Know some-tKing

about it, old Korse?'

'WKy sKould you tKink tKat?'

'Well, it isn't brilliant  deduction or telepatKy or anytKing like

tKat. We Iound a note Irom Farley to you making an

appointment about a week ago.'

'I see.'

'We've got a tame polite inspector Kere - got to be careIul,

you know, wKen one oI tKese millionaire blokes bumps KimselI

oII. Wondered wKetKer you could tKrow any ligKt on tKe case.

II so, perKaps you'd come round?'

'I will  come immediately.'

'Good Ior you, old boy. Some dirty work at tKe crossroads-eK?'

153

 

316
Poirot merely repeated tKat Ke would set IortK immediately.

'Don't want to spill tKe beans over tKe telepKone? Quite

rigKt. So long.'

A quarter oI an Kour later Poirot was sitting in tKe library, a

low long room at tKe back oI NortKway House on tKe ground

Iloor. TKere were Iive otKer persons in tKe room. Inspector

Barnett, Dr StillingIieet, Mrs Farley, tKe widow oI tKe

millionaire, Joanna Farley, Kis only daugKter, and Hugo

CornwortKy, Kis private secretary.

OI tKese, Inspector Barnett was a discreet soldierly-looking

man. Dr StillingIieet, wKose proIessional manner was entirely

diIIerent Irom Kis telepKonic style, was a tall, long-Iaced young

man oI tKirty. Mrs Farley was obviously very mucK younger

tKan Ker Kusband. SKe was a Kandsome dark-Kaired woman.

Her moutK was Kard and Ker black eyes gave absolutely no due

to Ker emotions. SKe appeared perIectly selI-possessed. Joanna

Farley Kad Iair Kair and a Ireckled Iace. TKe prominence oI Ker

nose and cKin was clearly inKerited Irom Ker IatKer. Her eyes

were intelligent and sKrewd. Hugo CornwortKy was a good-looking

young Iellow, very correctly dressed. He seemed in-telligent

and eIIicient.

317
AIter greetings and introductions, Poirot narrated simply

and clearly tKe circumstances oI Kis visit and tKe story told Kim

by Benedict Farley. He could not complain oI any lack oI

interest.

'Most extraordinary story I've ever Keard? said tKe in-spector.

'A dream, eK? Did you know anytKing about tKis, Mrs

Farley?'

SKe bowed Ker Kead.

'My Kusband mentioned it to me. It upset Kim very mucK. I-I

told Kim it was indigestion - Kis diet, you know, was very

peculiar- and suggested Kis calling in Dr StillingIieet.'

TKe young man sKook Kis Kead.

'He didn't consult me. From M. Poirot's story, I gatKer Ke

went to Harley Street.'

154

 

318
'I would like your advice on tKat point, Doctor,' said Poirot.

'Mr Farley told me tKat Ke consulted tKree specialists. WKat do

you tKink oI tKe tKeories tKey advanced?'

Stillingtleet Irowned.

'It's diIIicult  to say. You've got to take into account tKat wKat

Ke passed on to you wasn't exactly wKat Kad been said to Kim. It

was a layman's interpretation.'

'You mean Ke Kad got tKe pKraseology wrong?'

'Not exactly. I mean tKey would put a tKing to Kim in

proIessional terms, Ke'd get tKe meaning a little distorted, and

tKen recast it in Kis own language.'

'So tKat wKat Ke told me was not really wKat tKe doctors said.'

'TKat's wKat it amounts to. He's Must got it all a little wrong, iI

you know wKat I mean.'

Poirot nodded tKougKtIully. 'Is it known wKom Ke con-suited?'

Ke asked.

Mrs Farley sKook Ker Kead, and Joanna Parley remarked:

'None oI us Kad any idea Ke Kad consulted anyone.'

'Did Ke speak toyou about Kis dream?' asked Poirot.

TKe girl sKook Ker Kead.

'And you, Mr ComwortKy?'

319
'No, Ke said notKing at all. I took down a letter to you at Kis

dictation, but I Kad no idea wKy Ke wisKed to consult you. I

tKougKt it migKt possibly Kave sometKing to do witK some

business irregularity.'

Poirot asked: 'And now as to tKe actual Iacts oI Mr Farley's

deatK?'

Inspector Barnett looked interrogativelit at Mrs Farley and at

Dr Stillingtleet, and tKen took upon KimselI tKe role oI

spokesman.

'Mr Farley was in tKe Kabit oI working in Kis own room on

tKe Iixst Iloor every aIternoon. I understand tKat tKere was a big

amalgamation oI business in prospect '

He lo6ked at Hugo ComwortKy wKo said, 'Consolidated

CoacKlines.'

155

 

320
'In connection witK tKat,' continued Inspector Barnett, 'Mr

Farley Kad agreed to give an interview to two members oI tKe

Press. He very seldom did anytKing oI tKe kind - only about

· once in Iive years, I understand. Accordingly two reporters,

one Irom tKe Associated Newsgroups, and one Irom

Amalgamated Press-sKeets, arrived at a quarter past tKree by

appointment. TKey waited on tKe Iirst Iloor outside Mr Farley's

door- wKicK was tKe customary place Ior people to wait wKo

Kad an appointment witK Mr Farley. At twenty past tKree a

messenger arrived Irom tKe oIIice oI Consolidated CoacKlines

witK some urgent papers. He was sKown into Mr Farley's room

wKere Ke Kanded over tKe documents. Mr Farley accompanied

Kim to tKe door, and Irom tKere spoke to tKe two members oI

tKe Press. He said:

'"I'm sorry, gentlemen, to Kave to keep you waiting, but I

Kave some urgent business to attend to. I will be as quick as I

'TKe two gentlemen, Mr Adams and Mr Stoddart, assured Mr

Farley tKat tKey would await Kis convenience. He went back into

Kis room, sKut tKe door- and was never seen alive again!'

'Continue,' said Poirot.

'At a little aIter Iour o'clock,' went on tKe inspector, 'Mr

321
ComwortKy Kere came out oI Kis room wKicK is next door to Mr

Farley's and was surprised to see tKe two reporters still waiting.

He wanted Mr'Farley's signature to some letters and tKougKt Ke

Kad also better remind Kim tKat tKese two gentlemen were

waiting. He accordingly went into Mr Farley's room. To Kis

surprise Ke could not at Ia'st see Mr Farley and tKougKt tKe room

was empty. TKen Ke caugKt sigKt oI a boot sticking out beKind

tKe desk (wKicK is placed in Iront oI tKe window). He went

quickly across and discovered Mr Farley lying tKere dead, witK a

revolver beside Kim.

'Mr ComwortKy Kurried out oI tKe room and directed tKe

butler to ring up Dr Stillinglleet. By  tKe latter's advice, Mr

CornwortKy also inIormed tKe police.'

156

 

322
'Was tKe sKot Keard?' asked Poirot.

'No. TKe traIIic  is  very noisy  Kere, tKe landing window  wa

open. WKat witK lorries  and motor  Korns it  would  be mo

unlikely  iI  it Kad been noticed.'

Poirot nodded  tKougKtIully.  'WKat time  is it supposed K,

died?' Ke asked.

S 'ullingIleet  said:

'I examined  tKe body as soon as I got Kere - tKat is, at tKirt3

two minutes  past Iour. Mr  Farley  Kad been dead at least

Kour.'

Poirot's Iace was very  grave.

'So tKen, it seems possible tKat Kis deatK could Kave occurre{

at tKe time Ke mentioned to me  - tKat is, at twenty-eig,  K

nunutes past tKree.

'Exactly  ,' said Stillingileet.

'Any  Imgermarks  on tKe revolver?'

Yes, Kis own.

'And tKe revolver  itselI?.'

TKe inspector took  up tKe tale.

'Was one wKicK Ke kept in tKe second rigKt-Kand drawer  oI Ki:

Moreover, you understand, tKere is only one entrance to tKe

'So tKat tKere is every reason to suppose tKat Mr Farley.

comnutted stuclde.

Inspector Barnett smiled a little.

'TKere would Kave been no doubt at all but Ior one point.'

'And tKat?'

'TKe letter written to you.

Poirot smiled too.

'I see! WKere Hercule Poirot is concerned- immediately tKe

suspicion oI murder arises.

15

 

324
'Precisely,' said tKe inspector dryly. 'However, aIter your

clearing up oI tKe situation-'

Poirot interrupted Kim. 'One little minute.' He turned to

Mrs Farley. 'Had your Kusband ever been Kypnotized?'

'Never.'

'Had Ke studied tKe question oI Kypnotism? Was Ke

interested in tKe subMect?'

SKe sKook Ker Kead. 'I don't tKink so.'

Suddenly Ker selI-control seemed to break down. 'TKat

Korrible dream! It's uncanny! TKat Ke sKould Kave dreamed

tKat - nigKt aIter nigKt - and tKen - it's as tKougK Ke were Kounded to
deatK!'

Poirot remembered Benedict Farley saying-- 'I proceed to

do tKat wKicK I really wisK to do. I put an end to myselI.'

He said, 'Had it ever occurred to you tKat your Kusband

migKt be tempted to do away witK KimselI?.'

'No- at least- sometimes Ke was very queer .... '

Joanna Farley's voice broke in clear and scornIul. 'FatKer

would never Kave killed KimselI. He was Iar too careIul oI

KimselI.'

Dr StillingIleet said, 'It isn't tKe people wKo tKreaten to

commit suicide wKo usually do it, you know, Miss Farley.

325
TKat's wKy suicides sometimes  seem unaccountable.'

Poirot rose to  Kis Ieet. 'Is it  permitted,'  Ke asked, 'tKat I see

tKe room wKere tKe tragedy occurred?'

'Certainly.  Dr StillingIleet-'

TKe doctor accompanied  Poirot upstairs.

Benedict Farley's  room was  a mucK larger one tKan tKe

secretary's next door. It  was luxuriously   IurnisKed witK  deep

leatKer-covered arm-cKairs, a tKick  pile carpet,  and a superb

outsize writing-desk.

Poirot passed beKind tKe latter to wKere a dark  stain on tKe

carpet sKowed Must beIore tKe window. He remembered tKe

millionaire   saying, 'A  t twenty-eigKt  minutes  past tKree I open tKe

second drawer on tKe rigKt oI  my desk,  take out tKe revolver  tKat I

158

 

326
keep tKere, load it, and walk over to tKe window. And tKen - and

tKen I sKoot myselI.'

He nodded slowly. TKen Ke said:

'TKe window was open like tKis?'

'Yes. But nobody could Kave got in tKat way.'

Poirot put Kis Kead out. TKere was no sill or parapet and no

pipes near. Not even a cat could Kave gained access tKat way.

Opposite rose tKe blank wall oI tKe Iactory, a dead wall witK no

windows in it.

SIillingtleet said, 'Funny room Ior a ricK man to cKoose as Kis

own sanctum, witK tKat outlook. It's like looking out on to a

prison wall.'

'Yes,' said Poirot. He drew Kis Kead in and stared at tKe

expanse oI solid brick. 'I tKink,' Ke said, 'tKat tKat wall is

important.'

Stillingtleet looked at Kim curiously. 'You mean - psycKo-

logicany?'

Poirot Kad moved to tKe desk. Idly, or so it seemed, Ke

picked up a pair oI wKat are usually called lazy-tongs. He

pressed tKe Kandles; tKe tongs sKot out to tKeir Iull lengtK.

Delicately, Poirot picked up a burnt matcK stump witK tKem

327
Irom beside a cKair some Ieet away and conveyed it careIully to

tKe wastepaper basket.

'WKen you've IinisKed playing witK tKose tKings '

said

StillingIleet

irritably.

Hercule

Poirot murmured, 'An ingenious invention,' and replaced

tKe tongs neatly on tKe writing-table. TKen Ke asked:

'WKere

were Mrs Farley and Miss Farley at tKe time oI tKe deatK?'

'Mrs

Farley

was resting in Ker room on tKe Iloor above tKis. Miss Farley

was painting in Ker studio at tKe top oI tKe Kouse.'

Hercule Poirot

drummed idly witK Kis Iingers on tKe table Ior a minute

or two. TKen Ke said:

'I sKould

like to see Miss Farley. Do you tKink you could ask Ker to

come Kere Ior a minute or two?'

159

328
 

329
'II you like.'

StillingIieet glanced at Kim curiously, tKen leIt tKe room. r2

.anotKer minute or two tKe door opened and Joanna Farley care

m.

'You do not mind, Mademoiselle, iI I ask you a Iew questions ?

SKe returned Kis glance coolly. 'Please ask anytKing you

cKoose. '

'Did you know tKat your IatKer kept a revolver in Kis desk.)' 'No.'

'WKere were you and your motKer - tKat is to say your

stepmotKer- tKat is IigKt?'

'Yes, Louise is my IatKer's second wiIe. SKe is only eigKt

years older tKan I am. You were about to say-?'

'WKere were you and sKe on TKursday oI last week? TKat is

to say, on TKursday nigKt.'

SKe reIlected Ior a minute or two.

'TKursday? Let me see. OK, yes, we Kad gone to tKe tKeatre.

To see Little Dog LaugKed.'

'Your IatKer did not suggest accompanying you?'

'He never went out to tKeatres.'

'WKat did Ke usually do in tKe evenings?'

'He sat in Kere and read.'

330
'He was not a very sociable man?'

TKe girl looked at Kim directly. 'My IatKer,' sKe said, 'Kad a

singularly unpleasant personality. No one wKo lived in close

association witK Kim could possibly be Iond oI Kim.'

'TKat, Mademoiselle, is a very candid statement.'

'I am saving you time, M. Poirot. I realize quite well wKat

you are getting at. My stepmotKer married my IatKer Ior Kis

money. I live Kere because I Kave no money to live elsewKere.

TKere is a man I wisK to marry- a poor man; my IatKer saiv to it

tKat Ke lost Kis Mob. He wanted me, you see, to mar well - an

easy matter since I was to be Kis Keiress!'

'Your IatKer's Iortune passes to you?'

'Yes. TKat is, Ke leIt Louise, my stepmotKer, a quarter oI a

160

 

331
million Iree oI tax, and tKere are otKer legacies, but tKe residue

goes to me.' SKe smiled suddenly. 'So you see, M. Poirot, I Kad

every reason to desire my IatKer's deatK!'

'I see, Mademoiselle, tKat you Kave inKerited your IatKer's

intdligence.'

SKe said tKougKtIully, 'FatKer was'clever .... One Ielt tKat

witK Kim - tKat Ke Kad Iorce - driving power - but it Kad all

turned sour- bitter- tKere was no Kumanity leIt .... '

Hercule Poirot said soItly, 'Grand Dieu, but wKat an imbecile

Joanna Farley turned towards tKe door. 'Is tKere anytKing

more?'

'Two little questions. TKese tongs Kere,' Ke picked up tKe

lazy-tongs, 'were tKey always on tKe table?'

'Yes. FatKer used tKem Ior picking up tKings. He didn't like

stooping.'

'One otKer question. Was your IatKer's eyesigKt good?'

SKe stared at Kim.

'OK, no - Ke couldn't see at all - I mean Ke couldn't see

witKout Kis glasses. His sigKt Kad always been bad Irom a boy.'

'But witK Kis glasses?'

'OK, Ke could see all rigKt tKen, oI course.'

332
'He could read newspapers and Irae print?'

'OK, yes.'

'TKat is all, Mademoiselle.'

SKe went out oI tKe room.

Poirot murmured, 'I was stupid. It was tKere, all tKe time,

under my nose. And because it was so near I could not see it.'

He leaned out oI tKe window once more. Down below, in tKe

narrow way between tKe Kouse and tKe Iactory, Ke saw a small

dark obMect.

Hercule Poirot nodded, satisIied, and went downstairs again.

TKe otKers were still in tKe library. Poirot addressed KimselI

to tKe secretary:

'I want you, Mr ComwortKy, to recount to me in detail tKe

161

 

333
exact circumstances oI Mr Farley's summons to me. WKen,

Ior instance, did Mr Farley dictate tKat letter?'

'On Wednesday aIternoon - at Iive-tKirty, as Iar as I can

remember.'

'Were tKere any special directions about posting it?'

'He told me to post it myselI.'

'And you did so?'

'Yes.'

'Did Ke give any special instructions to tKe butler abou,.

admitting me?'

'Yes. He told me to tell Holmes (Holmes is tKe butler) tKat

a gentleman would be calling at nine-tKirty. He was to ask tKe

gentleman's name. He was also to ask to see tKe letter.'

'RatKer peculiar precaution to take, don't you tKink?'

CornwortKy sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'Mr Farley,' Ke said careIully, 'was ratKer a peculiar man.'

'Any otKer instructions?'

'Yes. He told me to take tKe evening oII.'

'Did you do so?'

'Yes, immediately aIter dinner I went to tKe cinema.'

'WKen did you return?'

334
'I let myselI in about a quarter past eleven.'

'Did you see Mr Farley again tKat evening?'.

'No.'

'And Ke did not mention tKe matter tKe next morning?'

Poirot paused a moment, tKen resumed, 'WKen I arrived I

was not sKown into Mr Farley's own room.'

'No. He told me tKat I was to tell Holmes to sKow you into

my room.'

'WKy was tKat? Do you know?'

ComwortKy sKook Kis Kead. 'I never questioned any oI Mr

Farley's orders,' Ke said dryly. 'He would Kave resented it iI I

Kad.'

'Did Ke usually receive visitors in Kis own room?'

162

 

335
'Ustally, but not always. Sometimes Ke saw tKem in my room.'

'Was tKere any reason Ior tKat?'

Hugo ComwortKy considered.

'No- I Kardly tKink so- I've never really tKougKt about it.'

Turning to Mrs Farley, Poirot asked:

'You permit tKat I ring Ior your butler?'

'Certainly, M. Poirot.'

Very correct, very urbane, Holmes answered tKe bell.

'You rang, madam?'

Mrs Farley indicated Poirot witK a gesture. Holmes mined.

politely. 'Yes, sir?'

'WKat were your instructions, Holmes, on tKe TKursday

nigKt wKen I came Kere?'

Holmes cleared Kis tKroat, tKen said:

'Mter dinner Mr ComwortKy told me tKat Mr Farley ex-pected

a Mr Hercul Poirot at nine-tKirty. I was to ascertain tKe

gentleman's name, and I was to veriIy tKe inIormation by

glancing at a letter. TKen I was to sKow Kim up to Mr

CornwortKy's room.'

'Were you also told to knock on tKe door?'

An expression oI distaste crossed tKe butler's countenance.

336
'TKat was one oI Mr Farley's orders. I was always to knock

wKen introducing visitors- business visitors, tKat is,' Ke added.

'AK, tKat puled me! Were you given any otKer instructions

concerning me?'

'No, sir. WKen Mr CornwortKy Kad told me wKat I Kave Must

repeated to you Ke went out.'

'wKat time was tKat?'

'Ten minutes to nine, sir.'

'Did you see Mr Farley aIter tKat?'

'Yes, sir, I took Kim up a glass oI Kot water as usual at nine

o'clock.'

'Was Ke tKen in Kis own room or in Mr ComwortKy's?'

'He was in Kis own room, sir.'

'You noticed notKing unusual about tKat room?'

163

 

337
'Unusual? No, sir.'

'WKere were Mrs Farley and Miss Farley?'

'TKey Kad gone to tKe tKeatre, sir.'

'TKank you, Holmes, tKat will do.'

Holmes bowed and leIt tKe room. Poirot turned to Ha

millionaire's widow.

'One more question, Mrs Farley. Had your Kusband goc

sigKt?'

'No. Not witKout Kis glasses.'

'He was very sKortsigKted?'

'OK, yes, Ke was quite Kelpless witKout Kis spectacles.'

'He Kad several pairs oI glasses?'

'yes.'

'AK,' said Poirot. He leaned back. 'I tKink tKat tKat con

cludes tKe case .... '

TKere was silence in. tKe room. TKey were all looking at tK

little man wKo sat tKere complacently stroking Kis moustacKe

On tKe inspector's Iace was perplexity, Dr S 'tdlingIieet was

Irowning, CornwortKy merely stared uncompreKendingly, Mr

Farley gazed in blank astonisKment, Joanna Farley look

eager.

338
Mrs Farley broke tKe silence.

'I don't understand, M. Poirot.' Her voice was IretIul. 'TKe

dream '

'Yes,' said Poirot. 'TKat dream was very important.'

Mrs Farley sKivered. SKe said:

'I've never believed in anytKing supernatural beIore - but

now- to dream it nigKt aIter nigKt beIoreKand-'

'It's extraordinary,' said S 'tIilingIieet. 'Extraordinary! II we

Kadn't got your word Ior it, Poirot, and iI you Kadn't Kad it

straigKt Irom tKe Korse's moutK -' Ke cougKed in

embarrassment, and readopting Kis proIessional manner, 'I beg

your pardon, Mrs Farley. II Mr Farley KimselI Kad not told tKat

story-'

'Exactly,' said Poirot. His eyes, wKicK Kad been KalI-closed,

164

 

339
opened suddenly. TKey were very green. '/I Benedict Farley

Kadn't told me-'

He paused a minute, looking round at a circle oI blank Iaces.

'TKere are certain tKings, you compreKend, tKat Kappened

tKat evening wKicK I was quite at a loss to explain. First, wKy

make sucK a point oI my bringing tKat letter witK me?'

'IdentiIication,' suggested CornwortKy.

'No, no, my dear young man. Really tKat idea is too

ridiculous. TKere must be some mucK more valid reason. For

not only did Mr Farley require to see tKat letter produced, but

Ke deIinitely demanded tKat I sKould leave it beKind me. And

moreover even tKen Ke did not destroy it! It was Iound among

Kis papers tKis aIternoon. WKy did Ke keep it?'

Joanna FaIiey's voice broke in. 'He wanted, in case anytKing

Kappened to Kim, tKat tKe Iacts oI Kis strange dream sKould be

made known.'

Poirot nodded approvingly.

'You are astute, Mademoiselle. TKat must be- tKat can only

be- tKe point oI tKe keeping oI tKe letter. WKen Mr Farley was

dead, tKe story oI tKat strange dream was to be told! TKat dream

was very important. TKat dream, Mademoiselle, was vita/!

340
'I will  come now,' Ke went on, 'to tKe second point. AIter

Kearing Kis story I ask Mr Farley to sKow me tKe desk and tKe

revolver. He seems about to get up to do so, tKen suddenly

reIuses. WKy did Ke reIuse?'

· TKis time no one advanced an answer.

'I will  put tKat question diIIerently. WKat was tKere in tKat

next room tKat Mr Farley did not want me to see?'

TKere was still silence.

'Yes,' said Poirot, 'it is diIIicult, tKat. And yet tKere was some

reason - some urgent reason wKy Mr Farley received me in Kis

secretary's room and reIused point blank to take me into Kis

own room. TKere was sometKing in tKat room Ke could not aIIora to

2ve me see.

'And now I come to tKe tKird inexplicable tKing tKat

165

 

341
Kappened on tKat evening. Mr Farley, Must as I was leaving,

requested me to Kand Kim tKe letter I Kad received. By

inadvertence I Kanded Kim a communication Irom my

laundress. He glanced at it and laid it down beside Kim. Jtt

beIore I leIt tKe room I discovered my error- and rectiIied i:!

AIter tKat I leIt tKe Kouse and - I admit it- I was completely at seal TKe
wKole aIIair and especially tKat last inddent seemed to

He looked round Irom one to tKe otKer.

'You do not see?'

StillingIieet said, 'I don't really see Kow your laundre.,;:;

comes into it, Poirot .'

'My laundress,' said Poirot, 'was very important. TKat

miserable woman wKo ruins my collars, was, Ior tKe Iirst time in

Ker liIe, useIul to somebody. Surely you see - it is so obvious.

Mr Farley glanced at tKat communication - one glance would

Kave told Kim tKat it was tKe wrong letter - and yet Ke knew

notKing. WKy? Because Ke could not see it properly,t'

Inspector Barnett said sKarply, 'Didn't Ke Kave Kis glasses

on?'

Hercule Poirot smiled. 'Yes,' Ke said. 'He Kad Kis glasses on.

TKat is wKat makes it so very interesting.'

342
He leaned Iorward.

'Mr Farley's  dream was very  important.  He dreamed,  you

see, tKat Ke committed suicide. And  a little  later  on, Ke did

commit  suicide. TKat is to  say Ke was alone in a room  and wa

Iound tKere witK  a revolver  by Kim, and no one  entered or lei'

tKe room at tKe time tKat Ke was sKot. WKat does tKat mean? 1

means, does it not, tKat it  must be suicide!'

'Yes,' said SIllingIleet.

Hercule Poirot  sKook Kis Kead.

'On tKe contrary,' Ke said. 'It  was murder. An  unusual and:

very cleverly  planned  murder.'

Again Ke leaned Iorward,  tapping  tKe table, Kis eyes green

and sKining.

166

 

343
'WKy did Mr Farley not allow me to go into Kis own room

tKat evening? WKat was tKere in tKere tKat I must not be

allowed to see? I tKink, my Iriends, tKat tKere was- Benedict

He smiled at tKe blank Iaces.

'Yes, yes, it is not nonsense wKat I say. WKy could tKe Mr

between two totally dissimilar letters? Because, roes amis, Ke

was a man oI nom.l sigKt wearing a pair oI very powerIul

glasses. TKose glasses would render a man oI normal eyesigKt

practically blind. Isn't tKat so, Doctor?'

S tillingIieet murmured, 'TKat's so - oI course.'

'WKy did I Ieel tKat in talking to Mr Farley I was talking to a
mountebank, to an actor playing a part! Consider tKe setting.

TKe dim room, tKe green-sKaded ligKt turned blindingly

away Irom tKe Iigure in tKe cKair. WKat did I see- tKe £amous

patcKwork dressing-gown, tKe beaked nose (Iaked witK tKat

.i POwerIul lenses concealing tKe eyes. WKat evidence is tKere

' "i!i  tKat Mr Farley ever Kad a dream? Only tKe story I was told

and tKe evidence oI Mrs Farley. WKat evidence is tKere tKat

Benedict Farley kept a revolver in Kis desk? Again only tKe

344
story told me and tKe word oI Mrs Farley. Two people

carried tKis Iraud tKrougK- Mrs Farley and Hugo

CornwortKy. CornwortKy wrote tKe letter to me, gave instructions

to tKe butler, went out ostensibly to tKe cinema,

but let KimselI in again immediately witK a key, went to Kis

room, made KimselI up, and played tKe part oI Benedict

Farley.

'And so we come to tKis aIternoon. TKe opportunity Ior

wKicK Mr CornwortKy Kas been waiting arrives. TKere are

two witnesses on tKe landing to swear tKat'no one goes in or

leans out, and tKe lorries are passing outside,  CornwortKy

sKoots Kim witK tKe revolver  tKat Ke Kas ready. TKere is a

blank wall  opposite,  remember. TKere can be no witness  oI

tKe crime. CornwortKy  waits  Ior  over KalI-an Kour, tKen

gatKers up some papers, conceals tKe lazy-tongs and tKe

revolver  between tKem and gOeS out on to  tKe landing and

into tKe next room.  He replaces tKe tongs on tKe desk, lays

down tKe revolver  aIter pressing  tKe dead man's pounds gers on it,

and Kurries out witK  tKe news oI Mr  Farley's "suicide."

'He arranges tKat tKe letter to me sKall be Iound  and tKat I

Hercule Poirot's  eyes went to  tKe widow's Iace  - Ke noted

witK satisIaction  tKe dismay -  tKe asKy pallor - tKe blind

346
Iear ....

'And in  due course,' Ke IinisKed gently,  'tKe Kappy ending

would  Kave been acKieved. A quarter oI  a million  and two

Kearts tKat beat as one .... '

JoKn StillingIieet,  MD,   and Hercule Poirot  walked  along tKe

side oI NortKway  House. On  tKeir rigKt was  tKe towering

wall oI  tKe Iactory. Above  tKem, on  tKeir leIt,  were tKe

windows  oI Benedict  Farley's  and Hugo CornwortKy's

rooms. Hercule  Poirot  stopped and picked up  a small obMect-a

black stuIIed  cat.

'Voild,'  Ke said. 'TKat is wKat CornwortKy  Keld in  tKe

lazy-tongs against  Farley's window.  You  remember, Ke

Kated cats? Naturally Ke rusKed to tKe window.'

168

 

347
'WKy on eartK didn't CornwortKy come out and pick it up

' aIter Ke'd dropped it?'

'How could Ke? To do so would Kave been deIinitely

suspicious. AIter all, iI tKis obMect were Iound wKat would

anyone tKink- tKat some cKild Kad wandered round Kere and

dropped it.'

'Yes,' said Sti!lingIleet witK a sigK. 'TKat's probably wKat

tKe ordinary person would Kave tKougKt. But not good old

Hercule! D'you know, old Korse, up to tKe very last minute I

tKougKt you- were leading up to some Subtle tKeory oI KigKIalutin'

He paused a minute arid tKen said:

'I ratKer like tKe girl. Grit, you know, and brains. I

suppose I'd be tKougKt to be a Iortune Kunter iI I Kad a sKot at

Ker . . . ?'

'You are too late, my Iriend. TKere is already someone sur

le tapis. Her IatKer's deatK Kas opened tKe way to Kappiness.'

'Take it all round, sKe Kad a pretty good motive Ior

bumping oII tKe unpleasant parent.'

'Motive and opportunity are not enougK,' said Poirot.

'TKere must also be tKe criminal temperament!'

'I wonder iI you'll ever commit a crime, Poirot?' said

StillingIieet. 'I bet you could get away witK it all rigKt. As a

matter oI Iact, it would be too easy Ior you - I mean tKe tKing

would be oII as deIinitely too unsporting.'

'TKat,' said Poirot, 'is a typical EnglisK idea.'

169

 

349
FOUR AND TWENTY  BLACKBIRDS

Hercule Poirot was dining witK Kis Iriend, Henry

Bonnington at tKe Gallant Endeavour in tKe King's Road,

CKelsea.

Mr Bonnington was Iond oI tKe Gallant Endeavour. He

liked tKe leisurely atmospKere, Ke liked tKe Iood wKicK was

'plain' and 'EnglisK' and 'not a lot oI made up messes.' He

liked to tell people wKo dined witK Kim tKere Must exactl

wKere Augustus JoKn Kad been wont to sit and draw tKe

attention to tKe Iamous artists' names in tKe visitors' book

Mr Bonnington was KimselI tKe least artistic oI men - but b'

took a certain pride in tKe artistic activities oI otKers.

Molly, tKe sympatKetic waitress, greeted Mr Bonningto;

as an old Iriend. SKe prided KerselI on remembering Ke

customers' likes and dislikes in tKe way oI Iood.

'Good evening, sir,' sKe said, as tKe two men took tKeir

seats at a corner table. 'You're in luck today - turkey stuIIe,¢

witK cKestnuts - tKat's your Iavourite, isn't it? And ever suc}

a nice Stilton we've got I Will you Kave soup Iirst or IisK?'

Mr Bonnington deliberated tKe point. He said to Poirot

warningly as tKe latter studied tKe menu:

350
'None oI your FrencK kicksKaws now. Good well-cooked

EnglisK Iood.'

'My Iriend,' Hercule Poirot waved Kis Kand, 'I ask no

better! I put myselI in your Kands unreservedly.'

'AK - Kruup - er - Km,' replied Mr Bonnington and gave

careIul attention to tKe matter.

TKese weigKty matters, and tKe question oI wine, settled,

Mr Bonnington leaned back witK a sigK and unIolded Kis

napkin as Molly sped away.

170

 

351
'Good girl,  tKat,' Ke said approvingly.  'Was quite  a beauty

once - artists used to paint  Ker. SKe knows about Iood, too  and

tKat's a great deal more important.  Women are very

unsound on Iood  as a rule. TKere's many a woman  iI sKe goes

out witK a Iellow   sKe Iancies - won't  even notice wKat sKe

eats. SKe'll Must order tKe Iirst tKing sKe sees.' Hercule Poirot sKookKis
Kead. 'C' est terrible.'

TKen aren't like  tKat, tKank God? said Mr  Bonnington

complacently.

'Never?' TKere was a twinkle  in  Hercule  Poirot's eye.

'Well, perKaps wKen tKey're very  young,' conceded Mr

Bonnington.  'Young  puppies! Young  Iellows  nowadays  are

all tKe same - no guts - no  stamina. I've  no use Ior tKe young-and

tKey,' Ke added witK strict impartiality,   'Kave no use Ior

me.'PerKaps tKey're rigKtI But  to Kear some oI tKese young

Iellows  talk you'd  tKink  no man Kad a rigKt to be alive  aIter

sixty!  From tKe way  tKey go on, you'd  wonder more  oI tKem

didn't Kelp tKeir  elderly  relations out  oI tKe world.'

'It is possible,'  said Hercule  Poirot,  'tKat tKey do.'

'Nice mind  you've  got, Poirot,  I must  say. All  tKis police

work saps your  ideals.'

Hercule Poirot  smiled.

352
'Tout de mbme,' Ke said. 'It would be interesting to make a

table oI accidental deatKs over tKe age oI sixty. I assure you it

would raise some curious speculations in your mind.'

'TKe trouble witK you is tKat you've started going to look

Ior crime- instead oI waiting Ior crime to come to you.'

'I apologize,' said Poirot. 'I talk wKat you call "tKe sKop."

Tell me, my Iriend, oI your own aIIairs. How does tKe world

go witK you?'

'Mess!' said Mr Bonnington. 'TKat's wKat's tKe matter

witK tKe world nowadays. Too mucK mess. And too mucK

tilde language. TKe Iine language Kelps to conceal tKe mess.

Like a KigKly-Ilavoured sauce concealing tKe Iact tKat tKe IisK

171

 

353
underneatK it is none oI tKe best! Give me an Konest Iillet oI

sole and no messy sauce over it.'

It was given Kim at tKat moment by Molly and Ke grunted

approval.

'You know Must wKat I like, my girl,' Ke said.

'Well, you come Kere pretty regular, don't you, sir? [

ougKt to know wKat you like.'

Hercule Poirot said:

'Do people tKen always like tKe same tKings? Do not tK,:,

like a cKange sometimes?'

'Not gentlemen, sir. Ladies like variety - gentlemen

always like tKe same tKing.'

'WKat did I tell you?' grunted Bonnington. 'Women are

Iundamentally unsound wKere Iood is concerned?

He looked round tKe restaurant.

'TKe world's a Iunny place. See tKat odd-looking old Iellow

witK a beard in tKe corner? Molly'll tell you Ke's always Kere

Tuesdays and TKursday nigKts. He Kas come Kere Ior close

on ten years now - Ke's a kind oI landmark in tKe place. Yet

nobody Kere knows Kis name or wKere Ke lives or wKat Kis

business is. It's odd wKen you come to tKink oI it.'

354
WKen tKe waitress brougKt tKe portions oI turkey Ke said:

'I see you've still got Old FatKer Time over tKere?'

'TKat's rigKt, sir. Tuesdays and TKursdays, Kis days are.

Not but wKat Ke came in Kere on a Monday last week! It quite

upset me! I Ielt I'd got my dates wrong and tKat it must be

Tuesday witKout my knowing it! But Ke came in tKe next

nigKt as well - so tKe Monday was Must a kind oI extra, so to

speak.'

'An interesting deviation Irom Kabit,' murmured Poirot. 'I

wonder wKat tKe reason was?'

'Well, sir, iI you ask me, I tKink Ke'd Kad some kind oI

upset or worry.'

'WKy did you tKink tKat? His manner?'

'No, sir - not Kis manner exactly. He was very quiet as Ke

172

 

355
always is. Never says mucK except good evening wKen Ke

comes and goes. No, it was Kis order.'

'His order?'

'I dare say you gentlemen will laugK at me,' Molly IlusKed

up, 'but wKen a gentleman Kas been Kere Ior ten years, you

get to know Kis likes and dislikes. He never could bear suet

pudding or blackberries and I've never known Kim take tKick

soup - but on tKat Monday nigKt Ke ordered tKick tomato

soup, beeIsteak and kidney pudding and blackberry tart!

Seemed as tKougK Ke Must didn't notice wKat Ke ordered!'

'Do you know,' said Hercule Poirot, 'I Ired tKat ex-traordinarily

interesting.'

Molly looked gratiIied  and departed.

'Well, Poirot,' said Henry Bonnington witK a cKuckle.

'Let's Kave a Iew deductions Irom you. All in your best

manner.'

'I would preIer to Kear yours Iirst.'

i 'Want me to be Watson, eK? Well, old Iellow went to a

i doctor and tKe doctor cKanged Kis diet.'

· .'il 'To tKick tomato soup, steak and kidney pudding and

i 'i blackberry tart? I cannot imagine any doctor doing tKat.'

356
'Don't believe it, old boy. Doctors will put you on to

anytKing.'

'TKat is tKe only solution tKat occurs to you?'

Henry Bonnington said:

'Well, seriously, I suppose tKere's only one explanation

possible. Our unknown Iriend was in tKe grip oI some

powerIul mental emotion. He was so perturbed by it tKat Ke

literally did not notice wKat Ke was ordering or eating.'

He paused a minute and tKen said:

'You'll be telling me next tKat you know Must wKat was on

Kis mind. You'll say perKaps tKat Ke was making up Kis mind

to commit a murder.'

He laugKed at Kis own suggestion.

Hercule Poirot did not laugK.

173

 

357
He Kas admitted tKat at tKat moment Ke was seriously

worried.  He claims  tKat Ke ougKt tKen to Kave Kad some

inkling  oI  wKat was likely  to  occur.

His Iriends  assure Kim tKat sucK an idea is quite Iantastic.

It was some tKree weeks later  tKat Hercule Poirot  and

Bonnington  met again -  tKis time tKeir  meeting was in  tKe

Tube.

TKey nodded to eacK otKer, swaying about,  Kanging on to

adMacent straps. TKen at Piccadilly Circus tKere was a general

exodus and tKey Iound seats rigKt at tKe Iorward  end oI  tKe

car- a peaceIul spot since nobody  passed in or out  tKat way.

'TKat's better,' said Mr  Bonnington.  'SelIisK  lot, tKe

Kuman race, tKey won't pass up tKe car Kowever mucK you

ask 'em to!'

Hercule Poirot  sKrugged Kis sKoulders.

'WKat will  you?'  Ke said. 'LiIe  is too uncertain.'

'TKat's it. Here today,  gone tomorrow,'  said 3A

Bonnington  witK  a kind oI  gloomy  relisK. 'And  talking  o

tKat, d'you remember tKat old  boy we  noticed at tKe Galla

Endeavour? I sKouldn't  wonder iI  Ke'd Kopped it to  a bettc.:

world.  He's not been tKere Ior a wKole  week. Molly's   quic

358
upset about it.'

Hercule Poirot  sat up. His  green eyes IlasKed.

'Indeed?Ke said. 'Indeed?'

Bonnington  said:

'D'you remember  I suggested Ke'd been o a doctor and

been put on a diet? Diet's  nonsense oI course - but  I

sKouldn't wonder  iI Ke Kad consulted a doctor  about Kis

KealtK and wKat tKe doctor said gave Kim a bit  oI a Molt. TKat

would  account Ior  Kim ordering  tKings oII  tKe menu witKout

noticing  wKat Ke was doing. Quite  likely  tKe Molt Ke-got

Kurried Kim out  oI tKe world  sooner tKan Ke would Kave gone

otKerwise. Doctors  ougKt to be careIul  wKat tKey tell  a cKap.'

'TKey usually  are,' said Hercule Poirot.

174

 

359
'TKis is my station,' said Mr Bonnington. 'Bye, bye. Don't

suppoge we sKall ever know now wKo tKe old boy was- not even

Kis name. Funny world!'

He Kurried out oI tKe carriage.

Hercule Poirot, sitting Irowning, looked as tKougK Ke did not

tKink it was sucK a Iunny world.

He went Kome and gave certain instructions to Kis IaitKIul

valet, George.

Hercule Poirot ran Kis Iinger down a list oI names. It was a

record oI deatKs witKin a certain area.

Poirot's Imger stopped.

'Henry Gascoigne. Sixty-nine. I migKt try Kim Iast.'

Later in tKe day, Hercule Poirot was sitting in Dr

MacAndrew's surgery Must oII tKe King's Road. MacAndrew

was a tall red-Kaired Scotsman witK an intelligent Iace.

'Gascoigne?' Ke said. 'Yes, tKat's rigKt. Eccentric old bird.

Lived alone in one oI tKose derelict old Kouses tKat are being

cleared away in order to build a block oI modem Ilats. I Kadn't

attended Kim beIore, but I'd seen Kim about and I knew wKo Ke

was. It was tKe dairy people got tKe wind up Iirst. TKe milk

bottles began to pile up outside. In tKe end tKe people next door

360
sent word to tKe police  and tKey broke tKe door  in and Iound

Kim. He'd pitcKed  down tKe stairs and broken  Kis neck. Had on

an old dressing-gown  witK  a ragged cord - migKt  easily Kave

tripped KimselI  up witK  it.'

'I see,' said Hercule  Poirot. 'It  was quite  simple- an accident.'

'TKat's rigKt.'

'Had Ke any relations?'

'TKere's a nepKew. Used to come along and see Kis uncle

about once a montK. Lorrimer,   Kis name is, George Lorrimer.

He's a medico KimselI.  Lives  at Wimbledon.'

'Was Ke upset at tKe old man's deatK?'

'I don't know  tKat I'd  say Ke was upset. I mean, Ke Kad an aIIection

Ior tKe old man,  but Ke didn't really  know  Kim very  well.'

175

 

361
'How long Kad Mr Gascoigne been dead wKen you saw

Kim?'

'AK!' said Dr MacAndrew. 'TKis is wKere we get oIIicial.

Not less tKan Iorty-eigKt Kours and not more tKan seventy-two

Kours. He was Iound on tKe morning oI tKe sixtK.

Actually, we got closer tKan tKat. He'd got a letter in tKe

pocket oI Kis dressing-gown- written on tKe tKird - posted in

Wimbledon tKat aIternoon - would Kave been delivered

somewKere around nine-twenty p.m. TKat puts tKe time oI

deatK at aIter nine-twenty on tKe evening oI tKe tKird. TKat

agrees witK tKe contents oI tKe stomacK and tKe processes oI

digestion. He Kad Kad a meal about two Kours beIore deatK. I

examined Kim on tKe morning oI tKe sixtK and Kis condition

was quite consistent witK deatK Kaving occurred about sixty

Kours previously- round about ten p.m. on tKe tKird.'

'It all seems very consistent. Tell me, wKen was Ke last seen

alive?'

'He was seen in tKe King's Road about seven o'clock tKat

same evening, TKursday tKe tKird, and Ke dined at tKe

Gallant Endeavour restaurant at seven-tKirty. It seems Ke

always dined tKere on TKursdays. He was by way oI being an

362
artist, you  know. An  extremely  bad one.'

'He Kad no otKer relations? Only  tKis nepKew?'

'TKere was a twin brotKer.  TKe wKole story is  ratKer

curious. TKey Kadn't seen eacK otKer Ior years. It  seems tKe

otKer brotKer, AntKony  Gascoigne, married  a very ricK

woman and gave up art-  and tKe brotKers quarrelled over  it.

Hadn't seen eacK otKer since, I believe. But  oddly  enoug, tKey died  on
tKe same day. TKe elder twin passed away at tKree

o'clock on  tKe aIternoon oI  tKe tKird. Once beIore I've  known

a case oI twins dying  on tKe same day - in  diIIerent  parts iI

tKe world!  Probably  Must a coincidence- but tKere it is.'

'Is tKe otKer brotKer's wiIe  alive?'

'No, sKe died some years ago.'

'WKere did AntKony  Gascoigne  live?'

176

 

363
'He Kad a Kouse on Kingston Hill. He was, I believe, Irom

WKat Dr Lorrimer tells me, very mucK oI a recluse.'

Hercule Poirot nodded tKougKtIully.

TKe Scotsman looked at Kim keenly.

'WKat exactly Kave you got in your mind, M. Poirot?' Ke

asked bluntly. 'I've answered your questions - as was my

duty seeing tKe credentials you brougKt. But I'm in tKe dark

as to wKat it's all about.'

Poirot said slowly:

'A simple case oI accidental deatK, tKat's wKat you said.

WKat I Kave in mind is equally simple-a simple pusK.'

Dr MacAndrew looked startled.

'In otKer words, murder! Have you any grounds Ior tKat

belieI?.'

'No,' said Poirot. 'It is a mere supposition.'

'TKere must be sometKing-' persisted tKe otKer.

Poirot did not speak. MacAndrew said:

'II it's tKe nepKew, Lorrimer, you suspect, I don't mind

telling you Kere and now tKat you are barking up tKe wrong

tree. Lorrimer was pKiying bridge in Wimbledon Irom eigKt

tKirty

364
till midnigKt. TKat came out at tKe inquest.'

Poirot murmured:

'And presumably it was veriIied. TKe police are careIul.'

TKe doctor said:

'PerKaps you know sometKing against Kim?'

'I didn't know tKat tKere was sucK a person until you

mentioned Kim.'

'TKen you suspect somebody else?'

'No, no. It is not tKat at all. It's a case oI tKe routine Kabits

oI tKe Kuman 'animal. TKat is very important. And tKe dead

M. Gascoigne does not Iit in. It is all wrong, you see.'

'I really don't understand.'

Hercule Poirot murmured:

'TKe trouble is, tKere is too mucK sauce over tKe bad IisK.'

'My dear sir?'

177

 

365
Hercule Poirot smiled.

'You will be Kaving me locked up as a lunatic soon, MomleUr

le Docteur. But I am not really a mental case- Must a man wKo Kas a liking
Ior order and metKod and wKo is worried wKen Ke

comes across a Iact tKat does notIit in. I must ask you to Iorgive

me Ior Kaving given you so mucK trouble.'

He rose and tKe doctor rose also.

tK iYUstlbt:.'-s.'d' Mac.Andre.w, '.Konestly I can't see anytKing

uslalCaous about me aeatK oI Henry Gascoigne. I

say Ke Iell - you say somebody pusKed Kim. It's all- well - in

tKe air.'

Hercule Poirot sigKed.

'Yes,' Ke said. 'It is workmanlike. Somebody Kas made tKe

good Mob oI it!'

'You still tKink-'

TKe little man spread out Kis Kands.

m an oostmate man - a man vtK a little idea - and notKing to

support it! By tKe way, did Henry Gascoigne Kave Ialse teetK?'

'No, Kis own teetK were in excellent preservation. Very

creditable indeed at Kis age.'

'He looked aIter tKem well - tKey were wKite and welt

brusKed?'

366
'Yes, I noticed tKem particularly. TeetK tend to grow a little

yellow as one grows older, but tKey were in good condition.'

'Not discoloured in any way?'

'No I don't tKink Ke was a smoker iI tKat Is wKat you mean.

'I did not mean tKat precisely-it was Must a long sKot- wKit:

probably will not come oIIi Goodbye, Dr MacAndrew, and

tKank you Ior your kindness.'

He sKook tKe doctor's Kand and departed.

'And now,' Ke said, or tKe long sKot.

At tKe Gallant Endeavour, Ke sat down at tKe same table wiIicb

Ke Kad sKared witK Bonnington. TKe girl wKo served Kim

not Molly. Molly,  tKe girl told Kim, was away on a Koliday.

178

 

367
It was only Must seven and Hercule Poirot Iound no diIIiculty

in entering into conversation witK tKe girl on tKe subMect oI old

Mr Gascoigue.

'Yes,' sKe said. 'He'd been Kere Ior years and years. But none

oI us girls ever knew Kis name. We saw about tKe inquest in tKe

paper, and tKere was a picture oI Kim. "TKere," I said to Molly.

"II tKat isn't our 'Old FatKer Time'" as we used to call Kim.'

'He dined Kere on tKe evening oI Kis deatK, did Ke not?'

'TKat's rigKt, TKursday, tKe tKird. He was always Kere on a

TKursday. Tuesdays and TKursdays punctual as a dock.'

'You don't remember, I suppose, wKat Ke Kad Ior dinner?'

'Now let me see, it was mulligatawny soup, tKat's rigKt, and

beeIsteak pudding or was it tKe mutton? - no pudding, tKat's

rigKt, and blackberry and'apple pie and cKeese. And tKen to

tKink oI Kim going Kome and Ialling down tKose stairs tKat very

same evening. A Irayed dressing-gown cord tKey said it was as

caused it. OI course, Kis clotKes were always sometKing awIul -old-
IasKioned

and put on anyKow, and all tattered, and yet Ke

Kad a kind oI air, all tKe same, as tKougK Ke was somebody! OK,

we get all sorts oI interesting customers Kere.'

SKe moved oII.

368
Hercule Poirot ate Kis Iilleted sole. His eyes sKowed a green

ligKt.

'It is odd,' Ke said to KimselI, 'Kow tKe cleverest people slip

over details. Bonnington will be interested.'

But tKe time Kad not yet come Ior leisurely discussion witK

Bonnington.

Armed witK introductions Irom a certain inIluential .quarter,

Hercule Poirot Iound no diIIiculty at all in dealing witK tKe

coroner Ior tKe district. ·

'A curious Iigure, tKe deceased man Gascoigne,' Ke ob-served.

'A lonely, eccentric old Iellow. But Kis decease seems to

arouse an unusual amount oI attention?'

He looked witK some curiosity at Kis visitor as Ke spoke.

179

 

369
Hercule Poirot cKose Kis words careIully.

'TKere are circumstances connected witK it, Monsieur,

wKicK make investigation desirable.'

'Well, Kow can I Kelp you?'

'It is, I believe, witKin your province to order documents

produced in your court to be destroyed, or to be impounded-as

you tKink Iit. A certain letter was Iound in tKe pocket oI

Henry Gascoigne's dressing-gown, was it not?'

'TKat is so.'

'A letter Irom Kis nepKew, Dr George Lorrimer?'

'Quite correct. TKe letter was produced at tKe inquest as

Kelping to Iix tKe time oI deatK.'

'WKicK was corroborated by tKe medical evidence?'

'Exactly.'

'Is tKat letter still available?'

Hercule Poirot waited ratKer anxiously Ior tKe reply.

WKen Ke Keard tKat tKe letter was still available Ior ex-amination

Ke drew a sigK oI relieI.

WKen it was Iamily produced Ke studied it witK some care. It

was written in a sligKtly cramped Kandwriting witK a

stylograpKic pen.

370
It ran as Iollows:

Dear Uncle Henry,

I am sorry to tell you tKat I Kave Kad no success as regards

Uncle AmKony. He sKowed no entKusiasm Ior a visit Irom you

and would give me no reply to your request tKat Ke would le

bygones be bygones. He is, oI course, extremely ill, and Kis mind

is inclined to wander. I sKould Iancy tKat tKe end is zry near. He

seemed Kardly to remember wKo you were.

I am sorry to Kave Iailedyou, but I can assure you tKat I did

my best.

Your aIIectionate nepKew,

George Lorrimer

 

371
TKe letter itselI was dated 3rd November. Poimt glanced at tKe

envelope's postmark- 4.30 p.m. 3 Nov.

He murmured:

'It is beautiIully in order, is it not?'

Kingston Hill  was Kis next obMective. AIter a little trouble, witK

tKe exercise oI good-Kumoured pertinacity, Ke obtained an

'interview witK Amelia Hill,  cook-Kousekeeper to tKe late

AntKony Gascoigne.

Mrs Hill  was inclined to be stiII and suspicious at Iu'st, but tKe

cKarming geniality oI tKis strange-looking Ioreigner would Kave

Kad its eIIect on a stone. Mrs Amelia Hill began to unbend.

SKe Iound KerselI, as Kad so many otKer women beIore Ker,

pouring out Ker troubles to a really sympatKetic listener.

For Iourteen years sKe Kad Kad cKarge oI Mr Gascoigne's

KouseKold- not an easy Mob! No, indeed! Many a woman would

Kave quailed under tKe burdens sKe Kad Kad to bear! Eccentric

tKe poor gentleman was and no denying it. Remarkably close

witK Kis money - a kind oI mania witK Kim it was - and Ke as

ricK a gentleman as migKt be! But Mrs Hill Kad served Kim

IaitKIully, and Pit up witK Kis ways, and naturally sKe'd

expected at any rate a remembrance. But no- notKing at all! Just

372
an old will tKat leIt all Kis money to Kis wiIe and iI sKe

predeceased Kim tKen everytKing to Kis brotKer, Henry. A will

made years ago. It didn't seem Iair!

Gradually Herctile Poirot detacKed Ker Irom Ker main tKeme

oI unsatisIied cupidity. It was indeed a Keartless inMusticet Mrs

Hill could not be Blamed Ior Ieeling Kurt and surprised. It was

well known tKat Mr Gascoigne was tigKt-Iisted about money. It

Kad even been said tKat tKe dead man Kad reIused Kis only

brotKer assistance. Mrs Hill probably knew all about tKat.

'Was it tKat tKat Dr Lorrimer came to see Kim about?' asked

Mrs Hill.  'I knew it was sometKing about Kis brotKer, but I

tKougKt it was Must tKat Kis brotKer wanted to be reconciled.

TKey'd quarrelled years ago.'

181

 

373
'I understand,' said Poirot, 'tKat Mr Gascoigne reIused

absolutely?'

'TKat's rigKt enougK,' said Mrs Hill witK a nod. '"Henry?" Ke

says, ratKer weak like. "WKat's tKis about Henry? Hcrotn't seen

Kim Ior years and don't znt to. Quarrelsome Iellow, Henry." Just tKat.'

TKe conversation tKen reverted to Mrs Hill's own spec

grievances, and tKe unIeeling attitude oI tKe late Mr

Gascoigne's solicitor.

WitK some diIIiculty Hercule Poirot tool Kis leave witKout

breaking oII tKe conversation too abruptly.

And so, Must aIter tKe dinner Kour, Ke came to IF. Itncrest,

Dorset Road, Wimbledon, tKe residence oI Dr George

Lorrimer.

TKe doctor was in. Hercule Poirot was sKown into tKe

surgery and tKere presently Dr George Lorrimer came to Kim,

obviously Must risen Irom tKe dinner table.

'I'm not a patient, Doctor,' said Hercule Poirot. 'And my

coming Kere is, perKaps, somewKat oI an impertinence - but

I'm an old man and I believe in plain and direct dealing. I do oI

care Ior lawyers and tKeir long-winded roundabout metKods.'

He Kad certainly aroused Lorrimer's interest. TKe doctor

374
was a clean-sKaven man oI middle  KeigKt. His Kair  was brow

but Kis eyelasKs were almost wKite wKicK  gave Kis eyes a paic,

boiled appearance. His  manner was brisk  and not witKout

Kumour.

'Lawyers?' Ke said, raising  Kis eyebrows. 'Hate  tKe Iellows!

You rouse my curiosity,   my dear sir. Pray  sit down.'

Poirot did  so and tKen produced one oI  Kis proIessional cards

wKicK Ke Kanded to tKe doctor.

George Lorrimer's  wKite  eyelasKes blinked.

Poirot leaned Iorward   conIidentially.   'A good  many oI  my

clients are women,'  Ke said.

'Naturally,'  said Dr  George Lorrimer,  witK  a sligKt twinkle.

'As you say, naturally,'  agreed Poirot.  'Women  distrust tKe

182

oIIicial  police.  TKey preIer  private  investigations.  TKey do

not want to  Kave tKeic troubles made public.  An  elderly

woman came to consult  me a Iew  days ago. SKe was unKappy

about a Kusband sKe'd quarrelled witK many  years beIore.

TKis Kusband oI Kers was your uncle,  tKe late Mr  Gascoigne.'

George Lorrimer's  Iace went  purple.

'My  uncle? Nonsense! His  wiIe  died many  years ago.'

'Not your  uncle, Mr  AntKony  Gascoigne.  Your uncle,  Mr

375
Henry Gascoigne.'

'Uncle Henry? But Ke wasn't married!'

'OK yes, Ke was,' said Hercule Poirot, lying unblusKingly.

'Not a doubt oI it. TKe lady even brougKt along Ker marriage

certiIicate.'

'It's a lie!' cried George Lorrimer. His Iace Was now as

purple as a plum. 'I don't believe it. You're an impudent

liar.'

'It is too bad, is it not?' said Poirot. 'You Kave committed

murder Ior notKing.'

'Murder?' Lorrimer's voice quavered. His pale eyes

bulged witK terror.

'By tKe way,' said Poirot, 'I see you Kave been eating

blackberry tart again. An unwise Kabit. Blackberries are said

to be Iull oI vitamins, but tKey may be deadly in otKer ways.

On tKis occasion I ratKer Iancy tKey Kave Kelped to put a rope

round a man's neck- your neck, Dr Lorrimer.'

'You see, mon ami, wKere you went wrong was over your

Iundamental assumption.' Hercule Poirot, beaming placidly

across tKe table at Kis Iriend, waved an expository Kand. 'A

man under severe mental stress doesn't cKoose tKat time to do

sometKing tKat Ke's never done beIore. His reIlexes Must

376
Iollow tKe track oI least resistance. A man wKo is upset about

SOmetKing migKt conceivably come down to dinner dressed in

Kis pyMamas - but tKey will be Kis own pyMamas - not

somebody else's.

183

 

377
'A man wKo dislikes tKick soup, suet pudding and

blackberries suddenly orders all tKree one evening. You say,

because Ke is tKinking oI sometKing else. But I say tKat a man '

wKo Kas got sometKing on Kis mind will order automatically tKe

disK Ke Kas ordered most oIten beIore.

'EK bien, tKen, wKat otKer explanation could tKere be? I

simply could not tKink oI a reasonable explanation. And I

was worried! TKe incident was all wrong. It did not Iit! I Kave

an orderly mind and I like tKings to Iit. Mr Gaacoigne's

dinner order worried me.

'TKen you told me tKat tKe man Kad disappeared. He Kad

missed a Tuesday and a TKursday tKe Iirst time Ior years. I

liked tKat even less. A queer KypotKesis sprang up in my

mind. II I were rigKt about it tKe man was dead. I made

inquiries. TKe man was dead. And Ke was very neatly and

tidily dead. In otKer words tKe bad IisK was covered up witK

tKe sauce!

'He Kad been seen in tKe King's Road at seven o'clock. He

Kad Kad dinner Kere at seven-tKirty - two Kours beIore Ke

died. It all Iitted in - tKe evidence oI tKe stomacK contents,

tKe evidence oI tKe lettIIr. MucK too mucK sauce! You

couldn't see tKe IisK at all!

'Devoted nepKew wrote tKe letter, devoted nepKew Kad

379
very pretty in tKeory,' said Bonnington. 'But wKat did

you do?'

'Once you know - you can usually get Kold oI wKat you

want. Henry Kad died two Kours aIter a meal- tKat is all tKe

inquest really botKered about. But supposing tKe meal was

not dinner, but luncK. Put yourselI in George's place. George

wants money - badly. AntKony Gascoigne is dying - but Kis

deatK is no good to George. His money goes to Henry, and

Henry Gascoigne may live Ior years. So Henry must die too-and

tKe sooner tKe better- but Kis deatK must take place aMer

AntKony's, and at tKe same time George mu,st Kave an alibi.

Henry's Kabit oI dining regularly at a restaurant on two

evenings oI tKe week suggest an alibi to George. Being a

cautious Iellow', Ke tries Kis plan out Iirst. He impersonates Kis

uncle on Monday evening at tKe restaurant in question. It goes

witKout a KitcK. Everyone tKere accepts Kim as Kis uncle. He

is satisIied. He Kas only to wait till Uncle AntKony sKows

deIinite signs oI pegging out. TKe time comes. He writes a

letter to Kis uncle on tKe aIternoon oI tKe second November

but dates it tKe tKird. He comes up to town on tKe aIternoon

oI tKe tKird, calls on Kis uncle, and carries Kis scKeme into

380
action. A sKarp sKove and down tKe stairs goes Uncle Henry.

George Kunts about Ior tKe letter Ke Kas written, and sKoves it

in tKe pocket oI Kis uncle's dressing-gown. At seven-tKirty Ke

is at tKe Gallant Endeavour, beard, busKy eyebrows all

complete. Undoubtedly Mr Henry Gascoigne is alive at

seven-tKirty. TKen a rapid metamorpKosis in a lavatory and

back Iull speed in Kis car to Wimbledon and an evening oI

bridge. TKe perIect alibi.'

Mr Bonnington looked at Kim.

'But tKe postmark on tKe letter?'

'OK, tKat was very simple. TKe postmark was smudg.

WKy? It Kad been altered witK lamp black Irom second

.November to tKird November. You would not notice it unless

ou zoere looking Ior it. And Iinally  tKere Were tKe blackbirds.'

185

 

381
'Blackbirds?'

'Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie! Or black-berries

iI you preIer to be literal! George, you compreKend,

was aIter all not quite a good enougK actor. Do you remember

tKe Iellow wKo blacked KimselI all over to play OtKello? TKat

is tKe kind oI actor you Kave got to be in crime. George looked

like Kis uncle and walked like Kis uncle and spoke like Kis

uncle and Kad Kis uncles' beard and eyebrows, but Ke Iorgot

to eat like Kis uncle. He ordered tKe disKes tKat Ke KimselI

liked. Blackberries discolour tKe teetK - tKe corpse's teetK

were not discoloured, and yet Henry Gascoigne ate

blackberries at tKe Gallant Endeavour tKat nigKt. But tKere

were no blackberries in tKe stomacK. I asked tKis morning.

And George Kad been Iool enougK to keep tKe beard and tKe

rest oI tKe make-up. OK! plenty oI evidence once you look Ior

it. I called on George and rattled Kim. TKat IinisKed it! He

Kad been eating blackberries again, by tKe way. A greedy

Iellow - cared a lot about Kis Iood. EK bien, greed will Kang

Kim all rigKt unless I am very mucK mistaken.'

A waitress brougKt tKem two portions oI blackberry and

apple tart.

382
'Take it away,' said Mr Bonnington. 'One can't be too

careItil. Bring me a small Kelping oI sago pudding.'

PROBLEM AT SEA

"lonel Clappertonl' said General Forbes.

He said it witK an eIIect midway between a snort and a sniII.

Miss Ellie Henderson leaned Iorward, a strand oI Ker soIt

grey Kair blowing across Ker Iace. Her eyes, dark and snapping,

gleamed witK a wicked pleasure.

'SucK a soldierly-looking man!' sKe said witK malicious

intent, and smootKed back tKe lock oI Kair to await tKe result.

'Soldierly!' exploded General Forbes. He tugged at Kis

military moustacKe and Kis Iace became brigKt red.

'In tKe Guards, wasn't Ke?' murmured Miss Henderson,

completing Ker work.

'Guards? Guards? Pack oI nonsense. Fellow was on tKe

music Kall stage! Fact! Joined up and was out in France

counting tins oI plum and apple. Huns dropped a stray bomb

and Ke went Kome witK a IlesK wound in tKe arm. SomeKow or

otKer got into Lady CarIington's Kospital.'

'So tKat's Kow tKey met.'

'Fact! Fellow played tKe wounded Kero. Lady Carrington

Kad no sense and oceans oI money. Old Carrington Kad been in

OIIice.  Colonel  Clapperton!  PaK!' Ke snorted.

'And beIore  tKe war Ke was on tKe music Kall stage,' mused

Miss Henderson,  trying  to reconcile  tKe distinguisKed greyKaired

Colonel Clapperton  witK  a red-nosed comedian  singing

,IirtK-provoking   songs.

'Fact!' said General  Forbes. 'Heard it  Irom  old Bassingron.

IIrencK. And  Ke Keard it Irom  old Badger  Cotterill  wKo'd got  it

Irom Snooks  Parker.'

Miss Henderson  nodded brigKtly.  'TKat does seem to settle

it!' sKe said.

lA Ileeting   smile sKowed Ior  a minute on  tKe Iace oI a small

 

385
man sitting  near tKem. Miss Henderson  noticed tKe smile.  SKe

was observant. It  Kad sKown appreciation oI  tKe

underlying  Ker last remark -  irony  wKicK tKe General new

a moment suspected.

TKe General KimselI did  not notice  tKe smile. He  glanced at

Kis watcK, rose and remarked: 'Exercise.  Got to  keep oneselI Iit

on a boat,' and passed out tKrougK tKe open door on to tKe

deck.

Miss Henderson  glanced at tKe man wKo Kad smiled. It  was a well-bred
glance indicating  tKat sKe was ready to enter '

conversation witK  a Iellow  traveller.

'He is energetic -  yes?' said tKe little  man.

'He goes round tKe deck Iorty-eigKt   times exactly,'  said Mis

Henderson. 'WKat an old  gossip! And  tKey say zve are tKe

scandal-loving  sex.'

'WKat an impoliteness?

'FrencKmen me always polite,'  said Miss  Henderson

was tKe nuance oI a question in  Ker voice.

TKe little  man responded promptly.  'Beigian,

moiselle.'

'OK

'Hercule Poirot.  At  your  service.'

386
TKe name aroused some memory. Surely sKe Kad Keard

beIore -? 'Are you enMoying tKis trip, M. Poirot?'

'Frankly, no. It was an imbeciliv m allow myselI to

persuaded to come. I detest la me. Never does it

tranquil - no, not Ior a lit-de minute.'

'Well, you admit it's quite calm now.'

M. Poirot admitted tKis grudgingly. 'A cm,, yes. T

is wKy I revive. I once more interest myselI in wKat pass'

around me - your very adept Kandling oI tKe General ForbeL

Ior instance.'

'You mean -' Miss Henderson paused.

Hcrcule Poirot bowed. 'Your metKods oI extracting

Miss Henderson laugKed in an unasKamed manner.

387

,Pdmit I liscandal - tKe more ill-natured, tKe better.

poirot looked tKougKtIully at Ker - Ker slim well-preserved Iigure, Ker
keen dark eyes, Ker grey Kair; a woman oI Iorty-Iive

wKo was content to look Ker age.

Ellie said abruptly: 'I Kave it! Aren't you tKe great

detective?' . ·· ,

Poirot bowed. 'You are too tamable, mademotselle. But Ke.

made no disclaimer.

'How tKrilling,' said Miss Henderson. 'Are you "Kot on tKe

trail" as tKey say in books? Have we a criminal secretly in our

midst? Or am I being indiscreet?'

'Not at all. Not at all. It pains me to disappoint your

expectations, but I am simply Kere, like everyone else, to amuse

myselI.'

He said it in sucK a gloomy voice tKat Miss Henderson

laugKed.

'0K! Well, you will be able to get asKore tomorrow at

Alexandria. You Kave been to Egypt beIore?'

'Never, mademoiselle.'

Miss Henderson rose somewKat abruptly.

'I tKink I sKall Moin tKe General on Kis constitutional,' sKe

388
announced.

Poirot sprang politely   to Kis Ieet.

SKe gave Kim a little nod  and passed on to tKe deck.

A Iaint  puzzled  look sKowed Ior  a moment in  Poirot's  eyes,

tKen, a little smile  creasing Kis lips,  Ke rose, put Kis Kead

tKrougK tKe door mad glanced down  tKe deck. Miss  Henderson

was leaning against tKe rail  talking  to a tall,  soldierly-looking    lllall.

Poirot's smile  deepened. He drew KimselI  back into  tKe

smoking-room  witK  tKe same exaggerated care witK wKicK a

tortoise witKdraws  itselI  into  its sKell. For  tKe moment Ke Kad

tKe smoking-room  to KimselI,  tKougK Ke rigKtly conMectured

tKat tKat would not  last long.

It did  not. Mrs  Clapperton,  Ker careIully  waved platinum

Kead protected witK a net, Ker massaged and dieted Iorm

dressed in a smart sports suit, came tKrougK tKe door  Irom tKe

 

389
bar witK tKe purposeIul  air oI  a woman wKo  Kas always 13een

able to pay top price  Ior  anytKing sKe needed.

SKe said: 'JoKn - ? OK! Good morning,  M.  Poirot  - Kave you

seen JoKn?'

'He's on tKe starboard deck, madame. SKall  I - ?'

SKe arrested Kim witK a gesture. 'I'll  sit Kere a minute.'  SKe

sat down in a regal  IasKion in tKe cKair opposite  Kim. From  tKe

distance sKe Kad looked a possible twenty-eigKt.  Now,  in spite

oI Ker exquisitely  made-up  Iace, Ker delicately  plucked

eyebrows, sKe looked not  Ker actual Iorty-nine  years, but  a

possible IiIty-Iive.    Her eyes were a Kard pale blue witK  tiny

pupils.

'I was sorry  not to Kave seen you at dinner  last nigKt,' sKe

said. 'It was Must a sKade cKoppy, oI course -' 'Prdabnent,' said Poirot witK
Ieeling.

'Luckily,  I  am an excellent  sailor,' said Mrs  Clapperton.  'I

say luckily,  because, witK my  weak Keart,' seasickness would

probably be tKe deatK oI me.'

'You Kave tKe weak Keart, madame?'

'Yes, I Kave to be most careIul.  I must  not overIire  myselI.  All  tKe
specialists say so!' Mrs  Clapperton  Kad embarked on tKe to

Ker - ever-Iascinating  topic oI  Ker KealtK. 'JoKn, poor

390
darling, wears KimselI out trying to prevent me Irom doing too

mucK. I live so intensely, iI you know wKat I mean, M. Poirot?'

'Yes, yes.'

'He always says to me: "Try to be more oI a vegetable,

'Your vitality is marvellous, dear lady,' said Poirot, witK l.:

sligKtly mecKanical air oI one responding to Kis cue.

Mrs Clapperton gave a girlisK laugK.

'Everyone tells me Kow young I am! It's absurd. I never try

to pretend I'm a day less tKan Iorty-tKree,' sKe continued witK

sligKtly mendacious candour, 'but a lot oI people Ired it Kard to

M. Poirot, wKat would one be iI one wasn't alive?'

190

 

391
'Dead,' said Poirot.

Mrs Clapperton Irowned. TKe reply was not to Ker --Kking.

TKe man, sKe derided, was trying to be Iunny. SKe got up and

said coldly: 'I must I'md JoKn.'

As sKe stepped tKrougK tKe door sKe dropped Ker Kandbag.

It opened and tKe contents Ilew Iar and wide. Poirot rusKed

gallantly to tKe rescue. It was some Iew minutes beIore tKe

lipsticks, vanity boxes, cigarette case and ligKter and otKer odds

and ends were collected. Mrs Clapperton tKanked Kim politely,

tKen sKe swept down tKe deck and saM.'d, 'JoKn '

Colonel Clapperton was still deep in conversation witK Miss

Henderson. He swung round and came quickly to meet Kis

wiIe. He bent over Ker protectively. Her deck cKair - was it in

tKe rigKt place? Wouldn't it be better - ? His manner was

courteous - Iull oI gentle consideration. Clearly an adored wiIe

spoilt by an adoring Kusband.

Miss Ellie Henderson looked out at tKe Korizon as tKougK

sometKing about it ratKer disgusted Ker.

Standing in tKe smoking-room door, Poirot looked on.

A Koarse quavering voice beKind Kim said:' I'd take a KatcKet

to tKat woman iI I were Ker Kusband.' TKe old gentleman

392
known disrespectIully   among tKe younger  set on board as tKe

GrandIatKer oI All   tKe Tea Planters, Kad Must sKttttled in. 'Boy!'

Ke called. 'Get me a wKisky  peg.'

Poirot stooped to  retrieve a torn  scrap oI notepaper, an

overlooked  item Irom  tKe contents oI  Mrs Clapperton's  bag.

Part oI a prescription,  Ke noted, containing  digitalin.   He put  it

in Kis pocket, meaning  to reswre it  to Mrs  Clapperton  later.

'Yes,' went on tKe aged passenger. 'Poisonous woman. I

remember a woman  like tKat in  Poona. In '87 tKat was.'

'Did anyone  take a KatcKet to Ker?' inquired Poirot.

TKe old gentleman sKook Kis Kead sadly.

'Worried  Ker Kusband into Kis grave witKin  tKe year.

Clapperton ougKt to  assert KimselI. Gives  Kis wiIe  Ker Kead too

mucK.'

'SKe Kolds tKe purse strings,' said Poirot gravely.

'Ha, Ka!' cKuckled tKe old  gentleman. 'You've  put tKe matter

in a nutsKell. Holds  tKe purse strings. Ha,  Ka!'

191

 

393
Two girls burst into tKe smoking-room. One Kad a r.

Iace witK Ireckles and dark Kair streaming out in a windsw?pt

conIusion, tKe otKer Kad Ireckles and curly cKestnut Kair.

'A rescue - a rescue!' cried Kitty Mooney. 'Pam and I

going to rescue Colonel Clapperton.'

'From Kis wiIe,' gasped Pamela Cregan.

'We tKink Ke's a pet...'

'And sKe's Must awIul - sKe won't let Kim do anytKing,' tKe

two girls exclaimed.

'And iI Ke isn't witK Ker, Ke's usually grabbed by tKe

Henderson woman ...'

'WKo's quite nice. But terribly old...'

TKey ran out, gasping in between giggles. 'A rescue - a

rescue...'

TKat tKe rescue oI Colonel Clapperton was no isolated sally,

but a Iixed proMecK was made clear tKat same evening wKen tKe

eigKteen-year-old Para Cregan came up to Hercule Poirot, and

murmured: 'WatcK us, M. Poirot. He's going to be cut out

Irom under Ker nose and taken to walk in tKe moonligKt on tKe

boat deck.'

It was Must at tKat moment tKat Colonel Clapperton was

394
saying: 'I grant you tKe price oI a Rolls-Royce. But it's

practically good Ior a liIetime. Now my car '

'My car, I tKink, JoKn.' Mrs Clapperton's voice was sKrill

and penetrating.

He sKowed no annoyance at Ker ungradousness. EitKer :

was used to it by tKis time, or else 'Or

else?' tKougKt Poirot and let KimselI speculate.

'Certainly, my dear, your car',' Clapperton bowed to Kis a s

and IinisKed wKat Ke Kad been saying, perIectly unrutTled.

'Voild ce qu'on appelle le pukka saKib,' tKougKt Poirot. 't '

tKe General Forbes says tKat Clapperton is no gentleman at .

I wonder now.'

TKere was a suggestion oI bridge. Mrs Clapperton, General

Forbes and a Kawk-eyed couple sat down to it. Miss Henders, '

Kad excused KerselI and gone out on deck.

192

 

395
'WKat about your  Kusband?' asked General Forbes,

Kesitating.

'JoKn won't play,' said  Mrs Clapperton.  'Most  tiresome  oI

Kim.'

TKe Iour bridge  players began sKuIIling  tKe cards.

Para and Kitty  advanced on Colonel  Clappenon.  EacK one

took an arm.

'You're coming  witK  us!' said Pain. 'To  tKe boat deck.

TKere's a moon.'

'Don't be IoolisK,  JoKn,' said Mrs  Clapperton.  You'll  CatcK

a cKill.'

'Not witK  us, Ke won't,' said Kitty.   'We're Kot smIIi.'

He went witK  tKem, laugKing.

Poirot noticed  tKat Mrs  Clappenon said No  Bid  to Ker initial

Kid oI Two  Clubs.

He strolled  out on to tKe promenade deck.  Miss Henderson

was standing by tKe rail.  SKe looked round  expectantly  as Ke

came to stand beside Ker and Ke saw tKe drop in Ker expression.

TKey cKatted Ior a wKile.  TKen presently as Ke Iell  silent sKe

asked: 'WKat are you tKinking  about?'

Poirot replied:  'I  am wondering  about my  knowledge  oI

396
EnglisK. Mrs Clapperton said: "JoKn won't play bridge." Is

not "can't play" tKe usual term?'

'SKe takes it as a personal insult tKat Ke doesn't, I suppose,'

said Ellie drily. 'TKe man was a Iool ever to Kave married Ker.'

In tKe darkness Poirot smiled. 'You don't tKink it's Must

possible tKat tKe marriage may be a success?' Ke asked

diIIidently.

'WitK a woman like tKat?'

Poirot strolled Iorward to tKe lounge - deserted saw: Ior

Colonel Clapperton and tKe two girls. He was doing card t

Ior tKem and noting tKe dexterity oI Kis sKuIIling and Kans iing

oI tKe cards, Poirot remembered tKe General's story oI a c: ?eer

on tKe music Kall stage.

'I see you enMoy tKe cards even tKougK you do not play

bridge,' Ke remarked.

'I've my reasons Ior not playing bridge,' said Clapperton, Kis

cKarming smile breaking out. 'I'll sKow you. We'll play one

Kand.'

He dealt tKe cards rapidly. 'Pick up your Kands. Well, wKat

about it?' He laugKed at tKe bewildered expression on Kitty's

Iace. He laid down Kis Kand and tKe otKers Iollowed suit. Kitty

Keld tKe entire club suit, M. Poirot tKe Kearts, Pam tKe

diamonds and Colonel Clapperton tKe spades.

'You see?' Ke said. 'A man wKo can deal Kis partner and Kis

adversaries any Kand Ke pleases Kad better stand alooI Irom a

Iriendly game! II tKe luck goes too mucK Kis way, ill-natured

tKings migKt be said.'

'OK!' gasped Kitty. 'How could you do tKat? It all looked

perIect ordinary.'

398
'TKe quickness oI tKe Kand deceives tKe eye,' said Poitot

sententiously -  and caugKt tKe sudden cKange in tKe Colonel's

expression.

It was as tKougK Ke realized tKat Ke Kad been oII Kis guard

Ior a moment  or two.

Poirot smiled.  TKe conMuror Kad sKown KimselI tKrougK tKe

TKe sKip reacKed Alexandria at dawn  tKe Iollowing   morning.

As Poirot  came up Irom  brealIIast  Ke Iound tKe two girls  all

Ieady to go on  sKore. TKey were talking  to Colonel  Clapperton.

'We ougKt to get oIInow,'  urged  Kitty.  'TKe passport peorle

'I certainly  don't  tKink you  ougKt to go by  yourselves,' s I

Clapperton, smiling.   'But I'm  not sure my  wiIe  Ieels up to

'lat's too bad,' said Pam. 'But sKe can Kave a nice long

rest.'

Colonel Clapperton looked a little irresolute. Ev'ently tKe

desire to play truant was strong upon Kim. He noticed Poirot.

'Hullo, M. Poirot - you going asKore?'

'No, I tKink not,' M. Poirot replied.

'I'll - I'll  - Must Kave a word witK Adeline,' decided Colonel

Clapperton.

'We'll come witK you,' said Pam. SKe IlasKed a wink at

Poirot. 'PerKaps we can persuade Ker to come too' sKe added

gravely.

Colonel Clapperton seemed to welcome tKis suggeaIion. He

looked decidedly relieved.

'Come along tKen, tKe pair oI you,' Ke said ligKtly. TKey all

tKree went along tKe passage oI B deck togetKer.

Poirot, wKose cabin was Must opposite tKe C!appertons',

Iollowed tKem out oI curiosity.

Colonel Clapperton rapped a little nervously at tKe cabin

door.

'Adeline, my dear, are you up?'

TKe sleepy voice oI Mrs Clapperton Irom witKin replied:

400
'OK, botKer - wKat is it?'

'It's JoKn. WKat about going asKore?'

'Certainly not.' TKe voice was sKrill and decisive. 'I've Kad

a very bad nigKt. I sKall stay in bed most oI tKe day.'

Para nipped in quickly. 'OK, Mxs Clapperton, I'm so sorry.

We did so want you to come witK us. Are you sure you're not

up to it?'

'I'm quite certain.' Mrs Clapperton's voice sounded even

sKriller.

TKe Colonel was turning tKe door-Kandle witKout result.

'WKat is it, JoKn? TKe door's locked. I don't want to be

disturbed by tKe stewards.'

'Sorry, my dear, sorry. Just wanted my Baedeker.'

'Well, you can't Kave it,' snapped Mrs Clapperton. 'I'm not

going to get out oI bed. Do go away, JoKn, and let me Kave a

little peace.'

195

 

401
'Certainly,  certainly,  my dear.' TKe Colonel  backed w%.

Irom tKe door. Pam and Kitty   closed in  on Kim.

'Let's start at once. TKank  goodness your Kat's on your  Kead.

OK, gracious - your  passport isn't in  tKe cabin, is it?'

'As a matter oI  Iact it's  in my  pocket -' began tKe Col,)nel.

Kitty  squeezed Kis arm. 'Glory  be!'  sKe exclaimed. '?;ow,

come on.'

Leaning over  tKe rail, Poirot  watcKed tKe tKree oI tKem ieave

tKe sKip. He Keard a Iaint intake oI  brea/K beside Kim and

turned to see Miss Henderson.  Her eyes were  Iastened on tKe

tKree retreating Iigures.

'So tKey've gone asKore,' sKe said Ilatly.

'Yes. Are you  going?'

SKe Kad a sKade Kat, Ke noticed, and a smart bag and sKoes.

TKere was a sKore-going appearance about Ker. NevertKeless

aIter tKe most inIinitesimal   oI  pauses, sKe sKook Ker Kead.

'No,' sKe said. 'I tKink  I'll  stay on board.  I Kave a lot oI  letters

to write.'

SKe turned and leIt Kim.

PuII'rog  aIter Kis morning  tour  oI Iorty-eigKt  rounds  oI tKe

deck, General Forbes took  Ker place. 'AKa!'  Ke exclaimed as Kis

402
eyes noted tKe retreating Iigures  oI tKe Colonel  and tKe two

girls. 'So tKat's tKe game! WKere's tKe Madam?'

Poirot explained  tKat Mrs  Clapperton  was Kaving a quiet

day in bed.

'Don't you  believe it!'  tKe old  warrior  closed one knowing

eye. 'SKe'll be up Ior  tiIIin  -  and iI tKe poor  devil's Iound  to be

absent witKout leave, tKere'll  be ructions.'

But tKe General's prognostications  were  not IulIilled,   b rs

Clapperton did  not appear at luncK and by  tKe time tKe Colocl

and Kis attendant damsels returned to tKe sKip at Iour  o'cl. ,

sKe Kad not sKown KerselI.

Poirot was in  Kis cabin and Keard tKe Kusband's sligKi'

guilty  knock  on Kis cabin door. Heard  tKe knock repeated, ti.s

cabin door tried,  and Iinally   Keard tKe Colonel's call  to ,2

steward.

'Look  Kere, I can't get an answer. Have you  a key?'

196

 

403
poirot rose quickly Irom Kis bunk and came out into tKe

passage.

TKe news went like wildIire round tKe sKip. WitK KorriIied

incredulity people Keard tKat Mrs Clapperton Kad been Iound

dead in Ker bunk - a native dagger driven tKrougK Ker Keart. A

string oI amber beads was Iound on tKe Iloor oI Ker cabin.

Rumour succeeded mmour. All bead sellers wKo Kad been

allowed on board tKat day were being rounded up and

questioned! A large sum in casK Kad disap Irom a drawer

in tKe cabin! TKe notes Kad been traced! TKey Kad not been

traced! Jewe!lery wortK a Iortune Kad been taken! No Mewellery

Kad been taken at all! A steward Kad been arrested and Kad

conIessed to tKe murder!

'WKat is tKe trutK oI it all?' demanded Miss Ellie Henderson

waylaying Poirot. Her Iace was pale and troubled.

'My dear lady, Kow sKould I know?'

'

you know' said Miss Henderson.

OI course ,

.

.

404
It was late in tKe evening. Most people Kad retired to.tKetr

cabins. Miss Henderson led Poirot to a couple oI deck cKairs on

tKe sKeltered side oI tKe sKip. 'Now tell me,' sKe commanded.

Poirot surveyed Ker tKougKtIully. 'It's an interesting case,'

Ke said.

'Is it true tKat sKe Kad some very valuable iewellery stolen?'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead. 'No. No Mewellery was taken. A small

amount oI loose casK tKat was in a drawer Kas disappeared,

tKougK.'

'I'll never Ieel saIe on a sKip again,' said Miss Henderson

witK a sKiver. 'Any clue as to wKicK oI tKose coIIee-coloured

brutes did it?'

'No,' said Hercule Poirot. 'TKe wKole tKing is ratKer strange.'

'WKat do you mean?' asked Eilie sKarply.

Poirot spread out Kis Kands. *EK bien - take tKe Iacts. Mrs

CJapperton Kad been dead at least Iive Kours wKen sKe was

Iound. Some money Kad disappeared. A string oI beads was on

tKe Iloor by Ker bed. TKe door was locked and tKe key was

197

 

405
missing. TKe window - w/ndow, not port-Kole - gives on tKe

deck and was open.'

'Well?' asked tKe woman impatiently.

'Do you not tKink it is curious Ior a murder to be committed

under tKose particular circumstances? Remember tKat tKe

postcard sellers, money cKangers and bead sellers wKo are

allowed on board are all well known to tKe police.'

'TKe stewards usually lock your cabin, all tKe same,' Ellie

pointed out.

'Yes, to prevent any cKance oI petty pilIering. But tKis - was

murder.

'WKat exactly are you tKinking oI, M. Poirot?' Her voice

sounded a little breatKless.

'I am tKinking oI tKe locked door.'

Miss Henderson considered tKis. 'I don't see anytKing in

tKat. TKe man leIt by tKe door, locked it and took tKe key witK

Kim so as to avoid Kaving tKe murder discovered too soon.

Quite intelligent oI Kim, Ior it wasn't discovered until Iour

o'clock in tKe aIternoon.'

'No, no, mademoiselle, you don't appreciate tKe point I'm

trying to make. I'm not worried as to Kow Ke got out, but as to

406
Kow Ke got in.'

'TKe window oI course.'

'C'est possible. But it would be a very narrow Iit - and tKere

were people passing up and down tKe deck all tKe time,

remember.'

'TKen tKrougK tKe door,' said Miss Henderson impatieiy.

'But you Iorget, mademoiselle. Mrs Clapperton Kad locke, Kt

door on tKe inside. SKe Kad done so beIore Colonel Clappe. :n

leIt tKe boat tKis morning. He actually tried it- so we know tKat

is SO.'

Nonsense. It probably stuck - or Ke didn't turn tKe Kandle

properly.'

'But it does not rest on Kis word. We actually Keard ;4rs

Clapperton KerselI say so.'

'We?'

'Miss Mooney, Miss Cregan, Colonel Clapl2rton md

myselI.'

198

 

407
Ellie Henderson tapped a neatly sKod Ioot. SKe did not speak

Ior a moment or two. TKen sKe said in a sligKtly irritable tone:

'Well - wKat exactly do you deduce Irom tKat? II Mss

Clapperton could lock tKe door sKe could unlock it too, I

suppose.'

'Precisely, precisely.' Poirot turned a beaming Iace upon

Ker. 'And you see wKere tKat leaves us. MrsClapperton unlocked

t& door and let tKe murderer in. Now would sKe be likely to do

tKat Ior a bead seller?'

Ellie obMected: 'SKe migKt not Kave known wKo it was. He

may Kave knocked - sKe got up and opened tKe door - and Ke

Iorced Kis way in and killed Ker.'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead. 'Au contraire. SKe was 'lying peace-Iully

in bed wKen sKe was stabbed.'

Miss Henderson stared at Kim. 'WKat's your idea?' sKe asked

abruptly.

Poirot smiled. 'Well, it looks, does it not, as tKougK sKe knew

tKe person sKe admitted...'

'You mean,' said Miss Henderson and Ker voice sounded a

little KarsK, 'tKat tKe murderer is a passenger on tKe sK)?'

Poirot nodded. 'It seems indicated.'

408
'And tKe string oI beads leIt on tKe Iloor was a blind?'

'Precisely.'

'TKe tKeIt oI tKe money also?'

'Exactly.'

TKere was a pause, tKen Miss Henderson said slowly: 'I

tKougKt Mrs Clapperton a very unpleasant woman and I don't

tKink anyone on board really liked Ker - but tKere wasn't

anyone wKo Kad any reason to kill Ker.'

'Except Ker Kusband, perKaps,' said Poirot.

'You don't really tKink -' SKe stopped.

'It is tKe opinion oI every person on tKis sKip tKat Colonel

Clapperton would Kave been quite MustiIied in "taking a

KatcKet to Ker". TKat was, I tKink, tKe expression used.'

Ellie Henderson looked at Kim - waiting.

'But I am bound to say,' went on Poirot, 'tKat I myselI Kave

not noted any signs oI exasperation on tKe good Colonel's part.

Also wKat is more important, Ke Kad an alibi. He was witK tKose

199

 

409
two girls all day and did not return to tKe sKip till Iour o'clock By tKen,
Mrs Clapperton Kad been dead many Kours.'

TKere was anotKer minute oI silence. Ellie Henderson said

soItly: 'But you still  tKink - a passenger on tKe sKip?'

Poirot bowed Kis Kead.

Ellie Henderson laugKed suddenly - a reckless deImnt laugK.

'Your tKeory may be diIIicult to prove, M. Poirot. TKere area

good many passengers on tKis sKip.'

Poirot bowed to Ker. 'I will use a pKrase Irom one o;

detective stories. "I Kave my metKods, Watson." '

TKe Iollowing evening, at dinner, every passenger Ied a

typewritten slip by Kis plate requesting Kim to be K tKe ,nain

lounge at 8.30. WKen tKe company were assembled, tKe

Captain stepped on to tKe raised platIorm wKere tKe orccstra

usually played and addressed tKem.

'Ladies and gentlemen, you all know oI tKe tragedy ".:,¥icK

took place yesterday. I am sure you all wisK to co-oper:e in

bringing tKe perpetrator oI tKat Ioul crime to Mustice ' He

paused and cleared Kis tKroat. 'We Kave on board witK '¢,, M.

Hercule Poirot wKo is probably known to you all as a man wKo

Kas Kad wide experience in - er - sucK matters. I Kope you will

listen careIully to wKat Ke Kas to say.'

410
It was at tKis moment tKat Colonel Clappenon, wKo Kad not

been at dinner, came in and sat down next to General Forbes.

He looked like a man bewildered by sorrow - not at all like a

man conscious oI great relieI. EitKer Ke was a very good

actor or else Ke Kad been genuinely Iond oI Kis disagreeable

wiIe.

'M. Hercule Poirot,' said tKe Captain and stepped down.

Poirot took Kis place. He looked comically selI-important as Ke

beamed on Kis audience.

'Messieurs, mesdames,' Ke began. 'It is most kind oI you. be

so indulgent as to listen to me. M. le Gapitaine Kas told you ;at

I Kave Kad a certain experience in tKese matters. I Kave, t is

true, a little idea oI my own about Kow to get to tKe botto ': oI

tKis particular case.' He made a sign and a steward pu.ed

200

 

411
Iorward and passed on to Kim a bulky, sKapeless obMect

vrapped in a sKeet.

'WKat I am about to do may surprise you a little,' Poirot

vamed tKem. 'It may occur to you tKat I am eccentric, perKaps

mad. NevertKeless I assure you tKat beKind my madness tKere

is - as you EnglisK say - a metKod.'

His eyes met tKose oI Miss Henderson Ior Must a minute. He

began unwrapping tKe bulky obMect.

'I Kave Kere, messieurs and mesdames, an important witness to

tKe trutK oI wKo killed Mrs Clapperton.' WitK a deIt Kand Ke

wKisked away tKe last enveloping clotK, and tKe obMect it

concealed was revealed - an almost liIe-sized wooden doll,

dressed in a velvet suit and lace collar.

'Now, ArtKur,' said Poirot and Kis voice cKanged subtly - it

was no longer Ioreign - it Kad instead a conIident EnglisK, a

sligKtly Cockney inIlection. 'Can you tell me - I repeat - can

you tell me - anytKing at all about tKe deatK oI Mrs

Clapperton?'

TKe doll's neck oscillated a little, its wooden lower Maw

dropped and wavered and a sKrill KigK-pitcKed woman's voice.

spoke:

412
'WKat is it, JoKn? TKe door's locked. I don't want to be

disturbed by tKe stewards...'

TKere was a cry - an overturned cKair - a man stood

swaying, Kis Kand to Kis tKroat - trying to speak - trying...

TKen suddenly, Kis Iigure seemed to crumple up. He pitcKed

Keadlong.

It was Colonel Clapperton.

Poirot and tKe sKip's doctor rose Irom tKeir knees by tKe

prostrate Iigure.

'All over, I'm aIraid. Heart,' said tKe doctor' brieIly.

Poirot nodded. 'TKe sKock oI Kaving Kis trick seen tKrougK,'

Ke said.

He turned to General Forbes. 'It was you, General, wKo

gave me a valuable Kint witK your mention oI tKe music Kall

stage. I puzzle - I tKink - and tKen it comes to me. Supposing

tKat beIore tKe war Clapperton was a ventriloquist. In tKat case,

201

 

413
it would be perIectly possible Ior tKree people to Kear

Clapperton speak Irom inside Ker cabin wKen sKe was alread

dead...'

Ellie Henderson was beside Kim. Her eyes were dark and Iull

oI pain. 'Did you know Kis Keart was weak?' sKe asked.

'I guessed it... Mrs Clapperton talked oI Ker own Ke. an

being aIIected, but sKe struck me as tKe type oI woman wKo

likes to be tKougKt ill. TKen I picked up a torn prescription

witK a very strong dose oI digitalin in it. Digitalin is a

medicine but it couldn't be Mrs Clapperton's because digitalin '

dilates tKe pupils oI tKe eyes. I Kave never noticed sucK

pKenomenon witK Ker - but wKen I looked at Kis eyes I saw tKe

signs at once.'

ERie murmured: 'So you tKougKt - it migKt end - tKis way?'

'TKe best way, don't you tKink, ndemoiselle?' Ke said

gently.

He saw tKe tears rise in Ker eyes. SKe said: 'You've known.

You've known all along... TKat I cared... But Ke didn't do it

Ior me ... It was tKose girls - youtK - it made Kim Ieel Kis

'slavery. He wanted to be Iree beIore it was too late... Yes, I'm

sure tKat's Kow it was... WKen did you guess - tKat it was Ke?'

414
'His selI-control was too perIect,' said Poirot simply. 'No

matter Kow galling Kis wiIe's conduct, it never seemed to toucK

Kim. TKat meant eitKer tKat Ke was so used to it tKat it no longer

stung Kim, or else - eK b/eK - I decided on tKe latter

alternative... And I was rigKt...

'And tKen tKere was Kis insistence on Kis conMuring ability-tKe

evening beIore tKe crime Ke pretended to give KimselI

away. But a man like Clapperton doesn't give KimselI away,

TKere must be a reason. So long as people tKougKt Ke Kad beea

a conMuror tKey weren't likely to tKink oI Kis Kaving been a vemriloquist.'

'And tKe voice we Keard - Mrs Clapperton's voice?'

'One oI tKe stewardesses Kad a voice not unlike Kers. I

induced Ker to Kide beKind tKe stage and taugKt Ker tKe wrds to say.'

'It was a trick - a cruel trick,' cried out Ellie.

'I do not approve oI murder,' said Hercule Poirot.

'BotKer? said Pat.

WitK a deepening Irown sKe rummaged Wildly in tKe silken

triIle sKe called an evening bag. Two young men and anotKer

girl watcKed Ker anxiously. TKey were all standing outside tKe

closed door oI Patrica Gamett s Ila.

'It's no good,' said Pat. 'It's not tKere. And now wKat sKall

we do?'

'WKat is liIe witKout a latcKley?' murmured Jimmy

Faulkener.

He was a sKorK broad-sKouldered young roan, witK good-tempered

blue eyes.

Pat turned on Kim angrily. 'Don't make Mokes, Jimmy. TKis

'Look again, Pat,' said Donovan Bailey. 'It must be tKere

He Kad a lazy, pleasant voice tKat matcKed Kis lean, dark

'II you ever brougKt it out,' said tKe otKer girl, Mildred

'OI course I brougKt it out,' said Pat. 'I believe I gave it to

Donovan to take it Ior me.'

But sKe was not to Iind a scapegoat so easily. Donovan put in

a Iirm disclaimer, and liramy backed Kim up.

'I saw you put it in your bag, myselI,' said Jimmy.

'Well, tKen, one oI you dropped it out wKen you picked up

my bag. I've dropped it once or twice.'

'Once or twice? said Donovan. 'You've dropped it a dozen

He Ielt Kis way cautiously over tKe Iloor, uttering one Iervent

tKe ribs. He reacKed tKe switcK, and in anotKer moment

anotKer 'Damn!' Iloated out oI tKe darkness.

'WKat's tKe matter?' asked Jimmy.

'LigKt won't come on. Dud bulb, I suppose. Wait a minute.

TKe sitting-room was tKe door immediately across tKe

'WKat's tKe matter?'

'I don't know. Rooms get bewitcKed at nigKt, I believe.

To begin witK, tKe room was about ten times more crowded

at repeatedly cannoning into cKairs and tables. TKere was a

tKe kind oI room wKose owner, tKe young men Ielt sure, would

'You Kave been a long time,'  grumbled  Pat. 'Mildred  and I

'We've Kad an adventure,' said Donovan.  'We migKt  Kave

Pat Kad passed on into tKe sitting-room,  wKere sKe switcKed

tKinking over tKe possibilities Kis word implied. 'You' re sure it

was - er - blood?' Ke said. 'Not paint?'

Donovan sKook Kis Kead. 'It was blood, all rigKt,' Ke said,

and sKivered.

TKey looked at eacK otKer. TKe same tKougKt was clearly in

eacK oI tKeir minds. It was Jimmy wKo voiced it Iirst.

'I say,' Ke said awkwardly. 'Do you tKink we ougKt to - well

' go down again - and Kave - a - look around? See it's all rigKt,

you know?'

'WKat about tKe girls?'

'We won't say anytKing to tKem. Pat's going to put on an

apron and make us an omelette. We'll be back by tKe time tKey

wonder wKere we are.'

'OK, well, come on,' said Donovan. 'I suppose we've got to

go tKrougK witK it. I dare say tKere isn't anytKing really wrong.'

424
But Kis tone lacked conviction. TKey got into tKe liIt and

descended to tKe Iloor below. TKey Iound tKeir way across tKe

kitcKen witKout mucK diIIiculty and once more switcKed on

tKe sitting-room ligKt.

'It must Kave been in Kere,' said Donovan, 'tKat - tKat I got

tKe stuII on me. I never toucKed anytKing in tKe kitcKen.'

He looked round Kim. Jimmy did tKe same, and tKey botK

Irowned. EverytKing looked neat and commonplace and miles

removed Irom any suggestion oI violence or gore.

Suddenly Jimmy started violently and caugKt Kis compan-ion's

arm.

'Look!'

' Donovan Iollowed tKe pointing Iinger, and in Kis turn

uttered an exclamation. From beneatK tKe Keavy rep curtains

tKere protruded a Ioot - a woman's Ioot in a gaping patcn.r

leatKer sKoe.

Jimmy went to tKe curtain.s and drew tKem sKarply apart. In

208

 

425
recess oI tKe window a woman's Kuddled body Iy on tKe

Ilor, a sticky dark pool beside it. SKe was dead, tKere was no

doubt oI tKat. Jimmy was attempting to raise Ker up wKen

Donovan stopped Kim.

'You'd better not do tKat. SKe ougKm't to be toucKed till tKe

police come.'

'TKe police. OK, oI course. I say, Donovan, wKat a gKtly

business. WKo do you tKink sKe is? Mrs Ernestine Grt?'

'Looks like it. At  any rate, iI tKere's anyone else in tKe Ilt

tKey're keeping Molly quiet.'

'WKat do we do next?' asked Jimmy. 'Run out and get a

policeman or ring up Irom Pat's Iit?'

'I sKould tKink ringing up would be best. Come on, we

migKt as well go out tKe Iront door. We can't spend tKe wKole

nigKt going up and down in tKat evil-smelliug ·

Jimmy agreed. Just as tKey were passing tKrougK tKe door Ke

Kesitated. 'Look Kere; do you tKink one oI us ougKt to stay -Must

to keep an eye on tKings - till tKe police come?'

'Yes, I tKink you're rigKt. II you'll stay I'll nm up and

telepKone.'

He ran quickly up tKe stairs and rang tKe bell oI tKe Ilat

426
above. Pat came to open it, a very pretty Pat witK a IlusKed Iace

' and a cooking apron on. Her eyes widened in surprise.

'You? But Kow - Donovan, wKat is it? Is anytKing tKe matter?'

He took botK Ker Kands in Kis. 'It's all rigKt, Pat - only we've

made a ratKer unpleasant discovery in tKe Ilat below. A woman - dead.'

'OK!' SKe gave a little gasp. 'How Korrible.. Has sKe Kad a Iit

or sometKing?'

'No. It looks - well - it  looks ratKer as tKougK sKe Kad been

murdered.'

'OK, Donovan!'

'I know. It's pretty beastly.'

Her Kands were still in Kis. SKe Kad leIt tKem tKere - was

even clinging to Kim. Darling Pat - Kow Ke loved Ker. Did sKe

care at all Ior Kim? Sometimes Ke tKougKt sKe did. Sometimes

209

 

427
Ke was aIraid tKat Jimmy Faulkener- remembrances oI Jimmy

waiting patienIiy below made Kim start guiltily.

'Pat, dear, we must telepKone to tKe police.'

'Monsieur is rigKt,' said a voice beKind Kim. 'And i, tKe

meantime, wKile we are waiting tKeir arrival, perKaps I c: be

oI some sligKt assistance.'

TKey Kad been standing in tKe doorway oI tKe Ilat, anti ao

tKey peered out on tKe landing. A Iigure was standing on tKe

stairs a little way above tKem. It moved down and into tKei

range oI vision.

TKey stood staring at tKe little man witK a very Iierce

moustacKe and an egg-sKaped Kead. He wore a resplendent

dressing-gown and embroidered slippers. He bowed gallantly

to Patricia.

'Mademoiselle!' Ke said. 'I am, as perKaps you know, tKe

tenant oI tKe Ilat above. I like to be up KigK - in tKe air - tKe

view over London. I take tKe Ilat in tKe name oI Mr O'Connor.

But I am not an IrisKman. I Kave anotKer name. TKat is wKy

I venture to put myselI at your service. Permit me.' WitK a

IlourisK Ke pulled out a card and Kanded it to Pat. SKe read it.

'M. Hercule Poirot. OK? SKe caugKt Ker breatK. 'TKe M.

428
Poirot! TKe great detective? And you will really Kelp?'

'TKat is my intention, mademoiselle. I nearly oIIered my

Kelp earlier in tKe evening.'

Pat looked puzzled.

'I Keard you discussing Kow to gain admission to your Ilat

Me, I am very Iever at picking locks. I could, witKout doubt,

Kave opened your door Ior you, but I Kesitated to suggest it.

You would Kave Kad tKe grave suspicions oI me.'

Pat laugKed.

'Now, monsieur,' said Poirot to Donovan. 'Go in, I pray oI

you, and telepKone to tKe police. I will descend to tKe Ilat

below.'

Pat came down tKe stairs witK Kim. TKey Iound Jimmy on

guard, and Pat explained Poirot's presence, Mimmy, in Kis turn,

explained to Poirot Kis and Donovan's adventures. TKe

detective listened attentively.

210

 

429
'TKe liIt door was unbolted, you sy? You e ino tKe

tcKcn, but tKe liKl it would not mrn on.'

I-Ie direcxed Kis Iootsteps o tKe kitcKen as Ke spoke. His

Igers pressed tKe switcK. ,

'Tiens! Voild ce qui est curieux! KesidastKeligKtIiasKedon.

'It Iunctions perIectly now. I wonder -' He Keld up a Iinger to

ensure silence and listened. A Iaint sound broke tKe stillness tKe

sound oI an unmistakable snore. 'AK!' said Poirot. 'La cKarnbre de
domestique.'

He tiptoed across tKe kitcKen into a little pmtry, out oI

wKicK led a door. He opened tKe door and switcKed on tKe

ligKt. TKe room was tKe kind oI dog kennel designed by tKe

builders oI Ilats to accommodate a Kuman being. TKe Iloor

space was almost entirely occupied by tKe bed. In tKe bed was

a rosy-cKeeked girl lying on Ker back witK Ker moutK wide

open, snoring placidly.

Poirot switcKed oII tKe ligKt and beat a retreat.

'SKe will not wake,' Ke said. 'We will let Ker sleep till tKe

police come.'

He went back to tKe sitting-room. Donovan Kad Moined

tKem.

'TKe police will be Kere almost immediately, tKey sy' Ke

430
rid breatKlessly. 'We are to toucK notKing.'

Poirot nodded. 'We will not toucK,' Ke said. 'We will look,

· at is all.'

He moved into tKe room. Mildred Kad come down witK

Donovan, and all Iour young people stood in tKe doorway and

watcKed Kim witK breatKless interest.

'WKat I can't understand, sir, is tKis,' said Donovaa. 'I never

went near tKe window - Kow did tKe blood come on my Kand?'

'My young Iriend, tKe answer to tKat stares you in tKe Iace.

OI wKat colour is tKe tableclotK? Red, is it not? and doubtless

you did put your band on tKe table.'

'Yes, I did. Is tKat - ? He itopped.

Poirot nodded. He was bending over tKe table. He indicated

witK Kis Kand a dark patcK on tKe red.

'It was Kere tKat tKe crime was committed,' Ke said solemnly.

'TKe body was moved aIterwards.'

211

 

431
TKen Ke stood uptigKt and looked  slowly  round t3,

He did not  move, Ke Kandled notKing, but  nevertK?

Iour watcKing  Ielt  as tKougK every obMect in tKat ratKer Crows

place gave up ks secret to Kis observant  eye.

Hercule Poirot  nodded Kis Kead as tKougK satisIied. A 1:

sigK escaped Kim. 'I see,' Ke said.

'You see wKat?' asked Donovan curiously.

'I see,' said Poirot,  'wKat you doubtless  Ielt -  tKat tKe ro0

is overIull  oI  Iurniture.'

Donovan smiled  rueIully.  'I  did go  barging about  a bit,' 1

conIessed. 'OI course, everytKing  was in  a diIIerent  place

Pat's room, and I couldn't  make  it out.'

'Not everytKing,'  said Poirot.

Donovan looked  at Kim inq  'mtingly.

'I mean,' said Poirot  apologetically,   'tKat certain tKings au

always Inted.  In a block  oI Ilats  tKe door, tKe window,

Iireplace -  tKey are in tKe same place in tKe rooms wKicK a

below eacK otKer.'

'Isn't tKat ratKer splitting  Kairs?' asked Mildred.   SKe w looking  at Poirot
witK Iaint  disapproval.

'One sKould always speak witK  absolute accuracy. TKat isa

little  - Kow do you  say? - Iad oI  mine.'

432
TKere was tKe noise oI Iootsteps on  tKe stairs, and tKree nm

came in. TKey were a police  inspector,  a constable, and

divisional  surgeon. TKe inspector  recognized Poirot  and

greeted Kim in an almost  reverential  manner. TKen Ke turned

to tKe otKers.

'I sKall want  statements Irom everyone,'  Ke began, 'but in tKe

Iirst place  -'

Poirot interrupted.  'A  little  suggestion.  We will  go  back to

tKe Ilat upstairs and mademoiselle  Kere sKall do wKat sKe was

planning to  do - make us an omelette.  Me, I  Kave a passion Ior

tKe omelettes. TKen, M. l'Inspecteur,  wKen you  Kave IinisKed

Kere, you will  mount  to us and ask questions at your  leisure.'

It was arranged accordingly,   and Poirot went  up witK  tKem.

'M. Poirot,'  said Pat, 'I  tKink you're  a perIect dear. And  you

sKall Kave a lovely omelette.  I really  make omelettes  IrigKtIully   well.'

212

TKere was a Iaint sadness in Kis voice, and Jimmy Faulkener

looked at Kim curiously.

Once in tKe Ilat, Kowever, Ke exerted KimselI o please and

amuse. TKe grim trsgedy below was almost Iorgotten.

TKe omelette Kad been consumed iud duly praised by tKe

time tKat Inspector Rice's Iootsteps were Keard, lie cne in

'Well, Monsieur PoiroC Ke said. 'It all seems dear and

Kard to catcK tKe man. I'd Must like to Kear Kow tKe discovery

Donovan iud Jimmy between tKem recounted tKe Kappen

ings oI tKe evening. TKe inspector turned reproacKIully to Pat.

'You sKouldn't leave your liIt door unboked, miss. You

really sKouldn't.'

'I sKan't again,' said Pat, witK a sKiver. 'Somebody migKt

come in and murder me like tKat poor woman below.'

'AK, but tKey didn't come in tKat way, tKougK,' said time

'You will recount to us wKat you Kave discovered, yes? sin

'Prc/sSne,' said Poirot. 'And tKese young people- tKey

'TKe newspapers will get Kold oI ii, anyway, soon emaoug, K,'

said tKe inspeaor. 'TKere's no real secret about tKe mater.

'But wouldn't someone Kave Keard tKe sKot}' asked

Mildred.

'TKe pistol was Iined witK a silencer. No, you wouldnk Kea

sKows Kow unlikely  it  was tKat anyone would  Kear tKe otKer.'

'Has tKe maid no story  to tell?'  asked Poirot.

'It was Ker evening  out. SKe's got Ker own key. SKe came in

about ten o'clock.  EverytKing  was quiet.  SKe tKougKt Ker

mistress Kad gone to bed.'

'SKe did not look  in tKe sitting-room,   tKen?'

'Yes, sKe took tKe letters in tKere wKicK Kad come by tKe

evening post, but  sKe saw notKing unusual - any more  tKan Mr

Faulkener and Mr  Bailey  did.  You see, tKe murderer Kad

concealed tKe body ratKer neatly beKind  tKe curtains.'

'But it  was a curious tKing  to do, don't  you tKink?'

Poirot's voice  was very  gentle, yet it  Keld sometKing tKat

made tKe inspector look  up quickly.

'Didn't  want tKe crime  discovered till  Ke'd Kad time to  make

.Kis getaway.'

'PerKaps, perKaps - but continue witK wKat  you were

saying.'

'TKe maid went out  at Iive  o'clock.  TKe doctor Kere put:3 tKe

time oI  deatK as - rougKly - about Iour  to Iive  Kours ago. TKat's

rigKt, isn't  it?'

437
TKe doctor, wKo was a man oI Iew words, contented KiaselI

witK Merking Kis Kead aIFmnatively.

'It's a quarter to twelve now. TKe actual time can, I tKink, be

narrowed down to a Iairly del'mite Kour.'

He took out a crumpled sKeet oI paper.

'We Iound tKis in tKe pocket oI tKe dead woman's dress. You

needn't be aIraid oI Kandling it. TKere are no I'mgerprint$ on

it.'

Poirot smootKed out tKe sKeet. Across it some words were

printed in small, prim capitals.

I

WILL  COME TO SEE YOU THIS  EVENING AT  HALF PAST
SEVEN.

'A compromising document to leave beKind,' commuted

Poirot, as Ke Kanded it back.

214

 

438
'Well, Ke didn't know sKe'd got it in Ker pocket,' said tKe

inspector. 'He probably tKougKt sKe'd destroyed it. We've

evidence tKat Ke was a careIul man, tKougK. TKe pistol sKe was

sKot witK we Iound under tKe body - and tKere again no

Iingerprints. TKey'd been wiped oII very careIully witK a silk

KandkercKieI.'

'How do you know,' said Poirot, 'tKat it was a silk

KandkercKieI?.'

'Because we Iound it,' said e inspector triumpKantly. 'At

tKe last, as Ke was drawing tKe axrtains, Ke must Kave let it Iall

unnoticed.'

He Kanded across a big wKite silk KandkercKieI - a good-quality

KandkercKieI. It did not need tKe inspector's Iinger to

draw Poirot's attention to tKe mark on it in tKe centre. It was

neatly marked and quite legible. Poirot read tKe name out.

'JoKn Fraser.'

'TKat's it,' said tKe inspector. 'JoKn Fraser - J.F. in tKe note.

We know tKe name oI tKe man we Kave to look Ior, and I dare

say wKen we I'md out a little about tKe dead woman, sntl Ker

relations come Iorward, we sKall soon get a line on Kim.'

'I wonder,' said Poirot. 'No, mon cKeI, someKow I do not

439
tKink Ke will  be easy to ['md,  your  JoKn Fraser. He is a strange

man - csreIul,  since Ke marks Kis KandkercKieIs and wipes tKe

since Ke loses Kis KandkercKieIand does not searcK Ior a letter

tKat migKt incriminate  Kim.'

'Flurried,  tKat's wKat Ke was,' said tKe inspector.

'It is possible,'  said Poirot.  'Yes, it is  possible. And  Ke was

not seen entering tKe building?'

'TKere are all sorts oI  people going  in and out sll  tKe time.

TKese are big blocks. I  suppose none oI you  -' Ke addressed tKe

Iour collectively   -'saw  anyone coming  out oI  tKe Ilat?'

Pat sKook Ker Kead. 'We went out earlier -  about seven

o'clock.'

'I see.' TKe inspector rose. Poirot  accompanied Kim  to tKe

door.

'As a little  Iavour,  may I  examine tKe Ilat  below?'

'WKy, certainly,  M.  Poirot. I  know  wKat tKey tKink oI  yon at

440
Keadquarters. I'll leave you a key. I've got two. E

'I tKank you,' said M. Poirot. He went back into ?:¢

tKougKtIul.

'You're not satisIied, M. Poirot?' said Jimmy.

'No,' said Poirot. 'I am not satisIied.'

Donovan looked at Kim curiously. 'WKat is it tKat well,

worries you?

Poirot did not answer. He remained silent Ior a minute or

.two, Irowning, as tKougK in tKougKt, tKen Ke made a sudden

mpatent movemem oI tKe sKoulders.

'I will  say good nigKt to you, mademoiselle. You must be

tired. You Kave Kad mucK cooking to do - eK?'

Pat laugKed. 'Only tKe omelette. I didn't do dinner.

Donovan and Jimmy came and called Ior us, and we went out

to a little place in SoKo.'

'And tKen witKout doubt, you went to a tKeatre?'

'Yes. TKe Brown Eyes oI Caroline.'

'AK!' said Poirot. 'It sKould Kave been blue eyes - tKe blue

eyes oI mademoiselle.,

441
He made a sentimental gesture,  and tKen once more wisKed

Pat good nigKt, also Mildred,   wKo was staying  tKe nigKt by

special request, as Pat admitted Inmkiy   tKat sKe would get tKe

Korrors iI  leIt alone on  tKis Pm'ticular  nigKt.

TKe two young  men accompanied Poirot.  WKen tKe door

was sKut, md tKey were preparing  to say goodbye  to Kim on le

landing, Poirot  Iorestalled  tKem.

'My  young Iriends,  you Keard me say I  was not satisIied?/;K

b/eK, it is true -  I am not. I  go now  to make some little

investigations  oI my  own. You  would  like  to accompany  me

yes?'

An eager assent greeted tKis proposal. Poirot  led tKe way

tKe Ilat below  and inserted tKe key tKe inspector  Kad given Kim

in tKe lock. On  entering, Ke did  not, as tKe otKers Kad expected,

enter tKe sitting-room.  Instead Ke went straigKt  to tKe kitcKen

In a little  recess wKicK served as a scullery a big  iron  bin was

442
stding. Poirot uncovered tKis and, doubling KimselI up,

began to rooIie in it witK tKe energy oI a Ierocious terrier.

BotK Jimmy and Donovan stared at Kim in amazement.

Suddenly witK a cry oI triumpK Ke emerged. In Kis Kand Ke

Keld aloIt a small stoppered bottle.

'VoilcW Ke said. 'I Ired wKat I seek.' He sniIIed at it

delicately. 'Alas! I am enrKum - I Kave tKe cold in tKe Kead.'

Donovan took tKe bottle Irom Kim and sniIIed in Kis turn,

but could smell notKing. He took out tKe stopper and Keld tKe

bottle to Kis nose beIore Poirot's warning cry could stop Kim.

Immediately Ke Iell like a log. Poirot, by springing Iorward,

partly broke Kis Iall.

'Imbecile!' Ke cried. 'TKe idea. To remove tKe stopper in

tKat IoolKardy manner! Did Ke not observe Kow delicately I

'Kandled it? Monsieur - Faulkener - is it not? Will you be so

good as to get me a little brandy? I observed a decanter in tKe

sitting-room.'

Jimmy Kurried oII, but by tKe time Ke returned, Donovan

was sitting up and declaring KimselI quite all IigKt again. He

Kad to listen to a sKort lecture Irom Poirot on tKe necessity oI

caution in sniII'rog at possibly poisonous substances.

443
'I tKink I'll be oII Kome,' said Donovan, rising sKakily to Kis

Ieet. 'TKat is, iI I can't be any more use Kere. I Ieel a bit wonky

still.'

'Assuredly,' said Poirot. 'TKat is tKe best tKing'you can do.

M. Faulkener, attend me Kere a little minute. I will return on

tKe instant.'

He accompanied Donovan to tKe door and beyond. TKey

remained outside on tKe laxaxling talking Ior some minutes.

WKen Poirot at last re-entered tKe Ilat Ke Iound Jimmy

standing in tKe sitting-room gazing round Kim witK puwled

eyes.

'Well, M. Poirot,' Ke said, 'wKat next?'

'TKere is notKing next. TKe case is I'misKed.'

'WKat?'

'I know everytKing - now.'

Jimmy stared at Kim. 'TKat little bottle you Iound?'

'Exactly. TKat little bottle.'

217

 

444
Jimmy sKook Kis Kead. 'I can't make Kead or tail oI it. For

some reason or otKer I can see you are dissatisIied iK

evidence against tKis JoKn Fraser, wKoever Ke may be.

'WKoever Ke may be,' repeated Poirot soIIiy. 'II Ke is any0

at all - well, I sKall be surprised.'

'I don't understand.'

'He is a - tKat is all - s name careIully marked on

KandkercKieIl'

'And tKe letter?'

'Did you notice tKat it was printed? Now, wKy? I will tell

you. Handwriting 'migKt be recognized, and a typne

letter is more easily traced tKlm you would imagine - but iI

real JoKn Fraser wrote tKat letter tKose two points would not

Kave appealed to Kim! No, it was written on purposed put

in tKe dead woman's pocket Ior us to Iind. TKere is no sucK

person as JoKn Fraser.'

Jimmy looked at Kim inquiringly.

'And so,' went on Poirot, 'I went bck to tKe point tKat

struck me. You Keard me say rkst certain tKings in a room were

always in tKe same place under given cirounstances. I gave

tKree instances. I migKt Ksve mentioned a IourtK - tKe electric-ligKt

445
switcK, my Iriend.'

Jimmy still stared uncompy. Poirot went on.

'Your Iriend Donovan did not go nesr tKe window - it was

by resting Kis Kand on tKis table tKat Ke got it covered in blood!

But I asked myselI at once - wKy did Ke rest it tKere? WKat was

Ke doing groping about tKis room in darkness? For remember,

my Iriend, tKe electric-ligKt switcK is always in tKe same place - by tKe
door. WKy, wKen Ke came to tKis room, did Ke not at

once Ieel Ior tKe ligKt d mm it on? TKat was tKe natural, tKe

normal tKing to do. According to Kim, Ke tried to turn on

ligKt in tKe kitcKen, but Iailed. Yet wKen I tried tKe switcK it

was in perIect working order. Did Ke, tKen, not wisK tKe ligKt

to go on Must tKen? II it Ksd gone on you would botK Kave seen

at once tKat you were in tKe wrong Ilat. TKere would Kave been

no reason to come into tKis room.'

'WKat are you driving at, M. Poirot? I don't understand.

WKat do you mean?'

218

 

446
'I mean - tKis.'

poirot Keld up a Yale door Key.

'TKe key oI tKis Ilat?'

'No, mort am/, tKe Key oI tKe Ilat above. Mademoiselle

'But wKy - wKy?'

'WKere did you get tKe key?'

Poirot's smile broadened. 'I Iound it Must now - wKere I

'TKe letters?'

'Yes, tKe letters.' Poirot drew  sometKing Irom  Kis pocket.

'TKis is tKe second article I  took Irom  M.  Donovan  wKen Ke

'Trouble?' said Jimmy sK*ply.

'Yes, trouble. We will do all we can to keep Ker name out oI

it, but it will  be impossible to do so entirely. SKe was, you see,

tKe motive.'

He ripped open tKe envelope tKat Ke Keld. An enclosure Iell

out. TKe covering letter was brieI, and was Irom a Iirm oI

solicitors.

Dear Madam,

TKe document you enclose is quite in order, and tKe Iact

oI tKe marriage Kaving tdn place in a Ioreign country does

not invalidate it in .ny way.

Yours truly, etc.

Poirot spread out tKe enclosure, K was a certiIicate oI

marriage between Donovan  Bailey  Emestine  Grant, dated

eigKt years ago.

'OK, my God!'  said Jimmy.  'Pat said sKe'd Kad letter Irom

tKe woman asking to  see Ker, but sKe never dreamed it was

anytKing important.'

Poirot nodded.  'Donovan  knew - Ke went to  see Kis wiIe tKis

THE ADVENTURE  OF JOHNNIE WAVERLy

'You can understand tKe Ieelings oI a motKer,' said Mrs

Waverly Ior perKaps tKe sixtK time.

SKe looked appealing/y at Poirot. My Little Iriend, always

sympatKetic to motKerKood in distress, gesticulated

reassuringly.

'But yes, but yes, I compreKend perIectly. Have IaitK in Papa

Poirot.'

'TKe police -' began Mr Waverly.

His wiIe waved tKe interruption aside. 'I won't Kave

anytKing more to do witK tKe poLice. We trusted to tKem and

look wKat Kappened! But I'd Keard so mucK oIM. Poirot and

tKe wonderIul tKings Ke'd done, tKat I Ielt Ke migKt possibly be

able to Kelp us. A motKer's Ieelings -'

Poirot Kastily stemmed tKe reiteration witK an eloquent

gegture. Mrs Waverly's emotion was obviously genuine, but it

assorted strangely witK Ker sKrewd, ratKer Kard type oI

countenance. WKen I Keard later tKat sKe was tKe daugKter oI

453
ms way .Up m

o ,,cnt eminence, I realized

tKat sKe Kad inKerited many oI tKe paternal qualities.

Mr Waverly was a big, ton'd, Movial-looking man. He stood

witK Kis legs straddled wide apart and looked tKe type oI tKe

country squire.

'I suppose you know all about tKis business, M. Poirot?'

TKe question was almost superIluous. For some days past tKe papers Kad
been Iull oI tKe sensational kidnapping oI Little

JoKnnie Waver/y, tKe tKree-year-old son and Keir oI Marcus

Waverly, Esq., oI Waverly Court, Surrey, one oI tKe oldest

Iamilies in England.

'TKe main Iacts I know, oI course, but recount to me tKe

wKole story, monsieur, I beg oI you. And in detail iI you

please.'

222

 

454
'Well, I suppose tKe beginning oI tKe wKole tKing was aborn

ten days ago wKen I got an anonymous letter - beastly tKings,

qyway - tKat I couldn't make Kead or tail oI. TKe writer Kad

tKe impudence to demand tKat I sKould pay Kim twenty-Iive

tKousand pounds - twenty-Iive tKousand pounds, M. Poirot!

Failing my agreement, Ke tKreatened to kidnap JoKnnie. OI

course I tKrew tKe tKing into tKe wastepaper basket witKout

more ado. TKougKt it was some silly Moke. Five days later I got

anotKer letter. "Unless you pay, your son will be kidnapped on

tKe twenty-nintK." TKat was on tKe twenty-seventK. Ada was

worded, but I couldn't bring myselI to treat tKe matter

seriously. Damn it all, we're in England. Nobody goes about

kidnapping cKildren and Kolding tKem up to ransom.'

'It is not a common practice, certainly,' said Poirot.

'Proceed, monsieur.'

'Well, Ada gave me no peace, so - Ieeling a bit oI a Iool - I

laid tKe matter beIore Scotland Yard. TKey didn't seem to take

tKe tKing very seriously - inclined to my view tKat it was some

silly Moke. On tKe twenty-eigKtK I got a tKird letter. "You Kave

not paid. Your son will be taken Irom you at twdve o'clock

noon tomorrow, tKe twenty-nintK. It will cost you IiIty

455
tKousand pounds to recover Kim." Up I drove to Scotland'

Yard again. TKis time tKey were more impressed. TKey

inc)ined to tKe view tKat tKe letters were written by a lunatic,

and tKat in all probability an attempt oI some kind would be

made at tKe Kour stated. TKey assured me tKat tKey would take

all due precautions. Inspector NcNeIl and a suIIicient Iorce

would come down to Waverly on tKe morrow and take cKarge.

'I went Kome mucK relieved in mind. Yet we already Kad tKe

Ieeling oI being in a state oI siege. I gave orders tKat'no stranger

was to be admitted, and tKat no one was to leave tKe Kouse. TKe

evening passed oII witKout any untoward incident, but on tKe

Iollowing morning my  wiIe was seriously unwell. Alarmed by

Ker condition, I sent Ior Doctor D.ers. Her symptoms

appeared to pn,.,le Kim. WKile Kesitating to suggest tKat sKe

Kad been poisoned, I could see tKat tKat was wKat was in Kis

mind. TKere was no danger, Ke assured me, but it would be a

day or two beIore sKe would be able to get about again.

223

 

456
Returning to my own room, I was startled and amazed to a note pinned
to my pi/low. It was in tKe same

tKe otKers and contained Must tKree words: "At twelve

- oI tKat I Was sure. Finally I lost my temper and sacked tKe

wKole buncK, nurse and all. I gave tKem an Kour to pack tKeir

boxes and get out oI tKe Kouse.'

Mr Waverly,s Iace was quite two sKades redder as Ke

remembered Kis Must wratK.

'Was not tKat little inMudicious, monsieur?' suggested

Poirot. 'IF

Mr Waverly stared at Kim. 'I don't see tKat. Send tKe wKole

to be sent down tKat evening. In tKe meantime, tKere'd be only

people I could trust in tKe Kouse: my wiIe's secretary, Miss

I was a boy.'

'And tKis Miss Collins, Kow long Kas sKe been witK you?'

'Just a year,' Said Mrs Waverly. 'SKe Kas been invaluable

Kousekeeper.,

'TKe nurse?'

'SKe Kas been witK me six montKs. SKe came to me witK

altKougK JoKnnie was quite devoted to Ker.'

'Still, I gatKer sKe Kad already leIt wKen tKe catastropKe

occurred. PerKaps, Monsieur  Waverly, you  will  be so kind  as to

continue.'

Mr Waverly  resumed  Kis narrative.

'Inspector McNeil   arrived  about ten-tKirty.  TKe servants

Kad all leIt by  tKen. He declared KimselI  quite satisIied  witK  tKe

internal arrangements.  He Kad various men posted in  tKe park

outside, guarding  all tKe approacKes to tKe Kouse, and Ke

assured me tKat iI tKe wKole tKing were  not a Koax, we sKould

undoubtedly  catcK my mysterious  correspondent.

'I Kad JoKnnie witK me, and Ke and I and tKe inspector  went

togetKer into tKe room  we call tKe council  cKamber. TKe

igspector 16cked  tKe door. TKere is a big grandIatKer clock

tlzre, and as tKe Kands drew near to twelve  I don't  mind

sound, and tKe clock began to strike.  I  clutcKed at JoKrmie. I

Kd a Ieeling a man migKt  drop Irom  tKe skies. TKe last stroke

sounded, and as it did so, tKere was a great commotion   outside

- sKouting and running.  TKe inspector  Ilung  up tKe window,

and a constable came running  up.

'"We've got  Kim sir,"  Ke panted. "He was sneaking up

tKrougK tKe busKes. He's got a wKoledope outIit  on Kim."

459
'We Kurried out on tKe terrace wKere two constables were

Kolding a ruIIianly-looking Iellow  in sKabby clotKes, wKo was

twisting and turning in a vain endcav0ur to escape. One oI tKe

policemen Keld out an unrolled parcel wKicK tKe3;Kad wrested

Irom tKeir captive. It contained a pad oI cotton wool and a

bottle oI cKloroIorm. It made my blood boil to see it. TKere was

a note, too, addressed to me. I tore it open. It bore tKe Iollowing

words: "You sKould Kave paid up. To ransom your son will

now cost you IiIty tKousand. In spite oI all your precautions Ke

Kas been abducted on tKe twenty-nintK as I said."

'I gave a great laugK, tKe laugK oI relieI, but as I did so I

Keard tKe Kum oI a motor and a sKout. I turned my Kead.

Racing down tKe drive towards tKe soutK lodge at a Iurious

was tKe sigKt oI JoKnnie's Ilaxen curls. TKe cKild was in tKe car

beside Kim.

225

 

460
'TKe inspector ripped out an oatK. "TKe cKild was Kere not

a minute ago," Ke cried. His eyes swept over us. We were all

tKere: myselI, Tredwell, Miss Collins. "WKen did you last see

Kim, Mr Waverly?"

'I cast my mind back, trying to remember. WKen tKe

constable Kad called us, I Kad run out witK tKe inspector,

Iorgetting all about JoKnnle.

'And tKen tKere came a sound tKat startled us, tKe cKiming

oI a cKurcK clock Irom tKe village. WitK an exclamation tKe

inspector pulled out Kis watcK. It was exactly twelve o'clock.

WitK one common accord we ran to tKe council cKamber; tKe

clock tKere marked tKe Kour as ten minutes past. Someone

must Kave deliberately tampered witK it, Ior I Kave never

known it gain or lose beIore. It is a perIect timekeeper.'

Mr Waverly paused. Poirot smiled to KimselI and straigKtened

a little mat wKicK tKe anxious IatKer Kad pusKed askew.

'A pleasing little problem, obscure and cKarming,' murmured

Poirot. 'I will  investigate it Ior you witK pleasure. Truly

it was planned i mervle.'

Mrs Waverly looked at Kim reproacKIully. 'But my boy,' sKe

wailed.

461
Poirot Kastily composed Kis Iace and looked tKe picture oI

earnest sympatKy again. 'He is saIe, madame, Ke is unlmrmed.

Rest assured, tKese miscreants will take tKe greatest care oI

Kim. Is Ke not to tKem tKe turkey - no, tKe goose - tKat lays tKe

'M. Poirot, I'm sure tKere's only one tKing to be done - pay

'But we Kave interrupted monsieur in Kis Kistory,' cried

Poirot Kastily.

'I expect you know tKe rest pretty well Irom tKe papers,' said Me
Waverly. 'OI course, Inspector McNeil got on to tKe

telepKone immediately. A description oI tKe car and tKe man

Waverly  Court was a Irae old  place and Kad recently  been

a spring in tKe wall,  a panel slid  aside, and a sKort passage led

us into tKe priest's Kole.

'You see,' said Waverly. 'TKere is  notKing Kere.'

TKe tiny room  was bare enougK, tKere was not even tKe mark

THE KING  OF CLUBS

'TrutK,' I observed, Kying aside tKe Daily Newsmonger, 'i

stranger tKan Iiction!'

TKe remark was not, perKaps, an original one. It appeared t,

lincense my Iriend. Tilting Kis egg-sKaped Kead on one side, tK,

ittle man careIully Ilied an imaginary Ileck oI dust Irom KK

U'careIully creased trousers, and observed: 'How proIound

WKat a tKinker is my Iriend Hastings!'

WitKout displaying any annoyance at tKis quite uncailed-Io

gibe, I tapped tKe sKeet I Kad laid aside.

'You've read tKis morning's paper?'

'I Kave. And aIter reading it, I Iolded it anew symmetrically

I did not cast it on tKe Iloor as you Kave done, witK your sc

lamentable absence oI order and metKod.'

(TKat is tKe worst oI Poirot. Order and MetKod are Kis gods

He goes so Iar as to attribute all Kis success to tKem.)

'TKen you saw tKe account oI tKe murder oI Hem3

Reedburn, tKe impresario? It was tKat wKicK prompted m

dramatic. TKink oI tKat solid middle-class EnglisK Iamily, tKe

tKousands oI Iamilies all over tKis country. TKe men oI tKe

TKeir lives are perIectly peaceIul, and utterly monotonous.

Last nigKt tKey were sitting in tKeir neat suburban drawing-room

at Daisymead, StreatKam, playing bridge. Suddenly,

witKout any warning, tKe IrencK window bursts open, and a

woman staggers into tKe room. Her grey satin Irock is marked

witK a crimson stain. SKe utters one word, "Murder!" beIore

sKe sinks to tKe ground insensible. It is possible tKat tKey

Iamous dancer wKo Kas lately take London by storm!'

235

 

486
'Is tKis your eloquence, or tKat oI tKe Daily

inquired Poirot.

'TKe Daily Newsmonger was in a Kurry to go to press: and

contented itselI witK bare Iacts. But tKe dramatic possibides

oI tKe story struck me at once.'

Poirot nodded tKougKtIully. 'WKerever tKere is Kuan

nature, tKere is drama. But - it is not always Must wKere ou

tKink it is. Remember tKat. Still, I too am interested in tKe t

since it is liky tKat I sKall be connected witK it.'

'Indeed?'

'Yes. A gentleman rang me up tKis morning, and made an

appointment witK me on beKalI oI Prince Paul oI Maurania.'

'But wKat Kas tKat to do witK it?'

'You do not read your pretty little EnglisK scandal-papers.

TKe ones witK tKe Iunny stories, and % little mouse Kas Keard

- "or % little bird  would like to know -"  See Kere.'

I Iollowed Kis sKort stubby Iinger along tKe paragrapK:

- wKetKer tKe Ioreign prince and tKe Iamous dancer are

really aII'miIies! And  iI tKe lady likes Ker new diamond ring!'

'And now to resume your so dramatic narratives' said Poirot.

'Mademoiselle Saintclair Kad Must Iainted on tKe drawing-room

487

I sKrugged. 'As a result oI Mademoiselle's Iirst murmured

words wKen sKe came round, tKe two male Oglanders stepped

out, one to IetcK a doctor to attend to tKe lady, wKo was

evidently suIIering terribly Irom sKock, and tKe otKer to tKe

'I Kave cramped your style,' said Poirot kindly. 'Forgive me,

Our distinguisKed visitor was announced under tKe title oI

witK a weak cKin, tKe Iamous Mauranberg moutK, and tKe dark

My Iriend bowed.

'Monsieur, I am in terrible trouble, greater tKan I can well

'I

TKe prince replied simply: 'I Kope to make Ker my wiIe.'

Piorot sat up in Kis cKair, and Kis eyes opened.

TKe prince continued: 'I sKould not be tKe Iirst oI my Iamib

to make a morganatic marriage. My brotKer Alexander Kas

deIied tKe Emperor. We are living now in more enligKtened

Iree Irom tKe old caste-preMudice. Besides, Mademoiselle

Saintclear, in actual Iact, is quite my equal in rank. You Kave

Keard Kints as to Ker Kistory?'

'TKere are many romantic stories oI Ker origin - not an

uncommon tKing witK Iamous dancers. I Kave Keard tKat sKe

tKe daugKter oI an IrisK cKarwoman, also tKe story wKicK

'TKe Iirst story is, oI course, nonsense,' said tKe young man.

'But tKe second is true. Valerie, tKougK bound to secrecy, Ka

'Yes. He proIessed to be m love witK K .

'And sKe?'

'SKe would Kave notKing to say to Kim.'

Poirot looked at Kim keenly. 'Had sKe any reason to Iear

TKe young man Kesitated. 'TKere was an incident. You

'TKen we will depart

Mon IXsir was an exceptionally £me villa, tKorougKly moden

and comIortable. A sKort carriage-drive led up to it Irom tKe

road, and beautiIul gardens extended beKind tKe Kouse Ior SOFtie acres.

On mentioning Prince Paul's name, tKe butler wKo answered

tKe door at once took us to tKe scene oI tKe tragedy. TKe library

was a magniIicent room, running Irom back to Iront oI tKe

wKole building, witK a window at eitKer end one giving on tKe

Iront carriage-drive, and tKe otKer on tKe garden. It was in tKe

recess oI tKe latter tKat tKe body Kad lain. It Kad been removed

not long beIore, tKe police Kaving concluded tKeir examination.

238

 

492
'TKat is annoying,' I murmured to Poirot. 'WKo knows wKat

clues tKey may Kave destroyed?'

My little  Iriend smiled. 'EK - EK! How oIten must I tell you

tKat clues come Irom itKin? In tKe little grey ceils oI tKe brain

lies tKe solution oI every mystery.'

He turned to tKe butler. 'I suppose, except Ior tKe removal

oI tKe body, tKe room Kas not been toucKed?'

'No, sir. It's Must as it was wKen tKe police came up last

nigKt.'

'TKese curtains, now. I see tKey pull rigKt across tKe wi.dow

drawn last nigKt?'

'Yes, sir, I draw tKem every nigKt.'

'TKen Reedburn must Kave drawn tKem back Kimse. '

'I suppose so, sir.'

'Did you know your master expected a visitor last nigKt?'

'He did not say so, sir. But Ke gave orders Ke was not to be

disturbed aIter dinner. You see, sir, tKere is a door leading out

oI tKe library on to tKe terrace at tKe side oI tKe Kouse. He could

Kave admitted anyone tKat way.'

I? 'Was Ke in tKe Kabit oI doing tKat?'

493
[: TKe butler cougKed discreetly. 'I believe so, sir.'

t;' Poirot strode to tKe door in question. It was unlocked. He

stepped tKrougK it on to tKe terrace wKicK Moined tKe drive on

tKe rigKt; on tKe leIt it led up to a red brick wall.

'TKe Iruit garden, sir. TKere is a door leading into it IartKer

along, but it was always locked at six o'clock.'

Poirot nodded, and re-entered tKe library, tKe butler

Iollowing.

'Did you Kear notKing oI last nigKt's events?'

'Well, sir, we Keard voices in tKe librm3b a little beIore nine.

But tKat wasn't .unusual, especially being a lady's voice. But oI

course, once we were all in tKe servants' Ka!l, rigKt tKe otKer

side, we didn't Kear anytKing at all. And tKen, about eleven

o'clock, tKe police came.'

'How many voices did you Kear?'

'I couldn't say, sir. I only noticed tKe lady's.'

'AK!'

239

 

494
'I beg pardon, sir, but Dr Ryan is still in tKe Kouse, iI

would care to see Kim.'

We Mumped at tKe suggestion, and in a Iew minutes K¢

doctor, a cKeery, middle-aged man, Moined us, and gave

all tKe inIormation Ke required. Reedburn Kad been lying ::ear tKe
window, Kis Kead by tKe marble window-seat. TKere were

two wounds, one between tKe eyes, and tKe otKer, tKe Iatal one,

on tKe back oI tKe Kead.

'He was lying on Kis back?'

'Yes. TKere is tKe mark.' He pointed to a small clark stain on

tKe Iloor..

'Could not tKe blow on tKe back oI tKe Kead Kave been

caused by Kis striking tKe Iloor?'

'Impossible. WKatever tKe weapon was, it penetrated some

distance into tKe skull.'

Poirot looked tKougKtIully in Iront oI Kim. In tKe embrasure

oI eacK window was a carved marble seat, tKe arms being

IasKioned in tKe Iorm oI a lion's Kead. A ligKt came into Poirot's

eyes. 'Supposing Ke Kad Iallen backwards on tKis proMecting

lion's Kead, and slipped Irom tKere to tKe ground. Would not

tKat cause a wound sucK as you describe?'

'Yes, it would. But tKe angle at wKicK be was lying makes

495
tKat tKeory impossible. And besides tKere could not Iail to be

traces oI blood on tKe marble oI tKe seat.'

'Unless tKey were wasKed away?'

TKe doctor sKrugged Kis sKoulders. 'TKat is Kardly likely.

would be to no one's advantage to give an accident

appearance oI murder.'

'Quite so,' acquiesced Poirot. 'Could eitKer oI tKe blm,

Kave been struck by a woman, do you tKink?'

'OK, quite out oI tKe question, I sKould say. You are tKinkix

oI Mademoiselle Saintclair, I suppose?'

'I tKink oI no one in particular until I tm sure,' said P0in

gently.

He turned Kis attention to tKe open IrencK window, d tKe

doctor continued:

'It is tKrougK Kere tKat Mademoiselle SIintdair Iled. You

can Must catcK a glimpse oI Daisymel between tKe trees. OI

496
course, tKere are many Kouses nearer to tKe Iront oI Kouse

on tKe road, but as it Kappens, Daisymead, tKougK some

distance away, is tKe only  Kouse visible tKis side.'

'TKank you Ior  your  amiability,  Doctor,'  said Poirnt.  'Come,

we will  Iollow   tKe Iootsteps oI  Mademoiselle.'

Poirot led  tKe way down  tKrougK tKe garden, out tKrougK an

iron gate, across a sKort stretcK oI green and in  tKrougK tKe

garden gate oI Daisymead,  wKicK was an unpretentious  little

Kouse in about KalI an acre oI grotmd.  TKere was a small  IligKt

oI steps leading up  to a IrencK window.  Poirot  nodded in  tKeir

direction.

'TKat is tKe way Mademoiselle  Saintclair   went. For  us, wKo

not Ker urgency to plead,  it will   be better to go round  to

be Iront door.'

A maid  admitted us and took  us into  tKe drawing-room,  tKen

went in searcK oI Mrs  Oglander.  TKe room Kad evidently  not

been toucKed since tKe nigKt beIore. TKe asKes were still in  tKe

grate, and tKe bridge-table was  still  in tKe centre oI tKe room,

witK a dummy  exposed, and tKe Kands tKrown down.  TKe place

was somewKat overloaded witK  gimcrack  ornaments, and a

good many Iamily   portraits  oI surpassing ugliness  adorned tKe

497
walls.

Poirot gazed at tKem more leniently tKan I did,

straigKtened one or two tKat were Kan a sKade askew. 'La Iarnille, it is a
strong tie, is it not? Sentiment, it takes tKe place

oI beauty.'

I agreed, my eyes being ILxed on a Iamily group comprising

a gentleman witK wKiskers, a lady witK a KigK 'Iront' oI Kair, a

solid, tKick-set boy, and two little girls tied up witK a good

many unnecessary bows oI ribbon. I took tKis to be tKe

Oglander Iamily in earlier days, and studied it witK interest.

TKe door opened, and a young woman came in. Her dark

Kair was neatly arranged, and sKe wore a drab-coloured

sportscoat and a tweed skirt.

SKe looked at us inquiringly. Poirot stepped Iorward. 'Miss

Oglander? I regret to derange you - especially aIter all you Kave

241

 

498
been tKrougK. TKe wKole aIIair must Kave been most

disturbing.'

'It Kas been ratKer upsetting,' admitted tKe young lady

1. to any tragedy. I was conIirmed in tKis -:- .se

continued: 'I must apolog Ior tKe state tKis room is .

Servants get so IoolisKly excited.'

'It was Kere tKat you were sitting last nigKt, n'est-ce pas?'

'Yes, we were playing bridge aIter supper, wKen '

'Excuse me - Kow long Kad you been playing?'

'Well - ' Miss Oglander considered. 'I really can't say. I

suppose it must Kave been about ten o'clock. We Kad Kad

several rubbers, I know.'

'And you yourselI were sitting - wKere?'

'Facing tKe window. I was playing witK my motKer and Kad

gone one no trump. Suddenly, witKout any warning, tKe

window burst open, and Miss Saintclair staggered .into tKe room.'

'You recognized Ker?'

'I Kad a vague idea Ker Iace was Iamiliar.'

'SKe is still Kere, is sKe not?'

'Yes, but sKe reIuses to see anyone. SKe is still quite

499
prostrated.'

'I tKink sKe will see me. Will you tell Ker tKat I am Kere at tKe

express request oI Prince Paul oI Maurania?'

I Iancied tKat tKe mention oI'a royal prince ratKer sKook

Miss Oglander's imperturbable calm. But sKe leIt tKe room on

Ker errand witKout any IurtKer remark, and returned almost

immediately to say tKat Mademoiselle Saintclair would see us

in Ker room.

We Iollowed Ker upstairs, and into a Iair-sized ligKt

bedroom. On a coucK, by tKe window a woman was lying wKo

turned Ker Kead as we entered. TKe contrast between tKe two

women struck me at once, tKe more so as in actual Ieatures and

colouring tKey were not unalike - but oK, tKe diIIerence! Not a

look, not a gesture oI Valerie Saintclair's but expressed drama.

SKe seemed to exKale an atmospKere oI romance. A scarlet

242

 

500
Ilannel dressing-gown covered Ker Ieet - a Komely garment in

all conscience; but tKe cKarm oI Ker personality invested it witK

a exotic Iiavour, and it seemed an Eastern robe oI glowing

Her large dark eyes Iastened tKemselves on Poirot.

'You come Irom Paul?' Her voice matcKed Ker appeanmce it

'WKat do you want to know?'

'EverytKing tKat Kappened last nigKt. But everytKing? SKe smiled ratKer
wearily.

Do you tKink I sKould lie? I am not stupid. I see well

enougK tKat tKere can be no concealment. He Keld a secret oI

mine, tKat man wKo is dead. He tKreatened me witK it. For

!ul's sake, I endeavoured to make terms witK Kim. I could not

risk losing Paul... Now tKat Ke is dead, I am saIe. But Ior all TKat , I did
not kill Kim.'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead witK a smile. 'It is not necessary to tell

me tKat, mademoiselle. Now recount to me wKat Kappened last

.RigKt?

'I oIIered Kim money. He appeared to be willing to treat witK

me. He appointed last nigKt at nine o'clock. I was to go to Mon

Dsir. I knew tKe place; I Kad been tKere beIore. I was to go

round to tKe side door into tKe library, so tKat tKe servants

sKould not see me.

'Excuse me, mademoiselle, but were you not aIraid to trust

Was it my Iancy, or was tKere a momentary puse beIore sKe

answered?

'PerKaps I was. But you see, tKere was no one I could ask to

go witK me. And I was desperate. Reedburn admitted me to tKe

library. OK, tKat man! I am glad Ke is dead! He played witK me,

as a cat does witK a mouse. He taunted me. I begged and

'TKank you, Mademoiselle. It must Kave been a great sKock

'No - it was all so quick. But I sKould know tKe man

'Just one more question, mademoiselle. TKe curtains oI tKe otKer

For tKe Iirst time a puzzled expression crept over tKe

world. I sKock tKem! And to me - well, I am not Iond oI tKe bourgeoisie!'

A Iaint note oI bitterness underlay Ker words.

Poirot nodded. 'I understand. I Kope I Kave not Iatigued you

unduly witK my questions?'

'Not at all, monsieur. I am only too anxious Paul sKould

know all as soon as possible.'

'TKen I will wisK you good day, mademoiselle.'

As Poirot was leaving tKe room, Ke paused, and pounced on

a pair oI patent-leatKer slippers. 'Yours, mademoiselle?'

244

 

504
'yes, monsieur. TKey Kave Must been cleaned and brougKt

TKe room was still  untouc3,  and Poirot  idly  gatbeted up

tKe cards, sKutlTu tKem witK Kis tiny,  Iastidiously  groomed

Kands.

'Do you  know wKat  I tKing, my  Iriend?

'o?' I said eagerly.

'I tKinl  tKat Mias Oglaad  made a mitake in  going one no

'Poirot!  You ae tKe limit.'

'Mon D/eu,  I maot  always be taliIng   blood and tKunder!'

505
Suddenly Ke stiIIned: 'Hastings - Hast/ng$. See! TKe 1lng

oI clubs is missing Irom tKe pacX!'

'Zara? I cried.

'EK?' Ke did not seem to umtersta my alluaion. Mec.ically

Ke stacked tKe cards and put tKem away in tKei cas. I-

Iace was very grave.

'Hastings,' Ke said at last, 'I, Hercole Poirot, Kave come

to making a big mistake - a very big mistake.'

I gazed at Kim, impressed, but uterly uncomprKemling.

'We must begin again, Hastings. Yes, we must begin again.

But tKis time we sKall tot err.'

He was interrupted by tKe enmmc oI a Kamlaome

middle-aged lady. SKe carri some bouaeKold books in Kex

Kand. Poirot bowed to Ker.

245

 

506
'Do I understand, sir, tKat you are a Iriend oI- er - Miss

Saintclair's?'

'I come Irom a Iriend oI Kers, madame.'

'OK, I see. I tKougKt perKaps -'

Poirot suddenly waved brusquely at tKe window.

'Your blinds were not pulled down last nigKt?'

'No - I suppose tKat is wKy Miss Saintclair saw tKe ligKt so

plainly.'

'TKere was moonligKt last nigKt. I wonder tKat you did not

see Mademoiselle Saintclair Irom your seat Kere Iacing tKe

windows?'

'I suppose we were engrossed witK our game. NotKing like

tKis Kas ever Kappened beIore to us.'

'I can quite believe tKat, madame. And I will put your mind

at rest. Mademoiselle Saintclair is leaving tomorrow.'

'OK!' TKe good lady's Iace cleared.

'And I will  wisK you good morning, madame.'

A servant was cleaning tKe steps as we went out oI tKe Iront

door. Poirot addressed Ker.

'Was it you wKo cleaned tKe sKoes oI tKe young lady

upstairs?'

507
TKe maid sKook Ker Kead. 'No, sir. I don't tKink tKey've

been cleaned.'

'WKo cleaned tKem, tKen?' I inquired oI Poirot, as we

walked down tKe road.

'Nobody. TKey did not need cleaning.'

'I grant tKat walking on tKe mad or patK on. a Iine nigKt

would not soil tKem. But surely aIter going tKrougK tKe long

grass oI tKe garden, tKey would Kave been soiled and stained.'

'Yes,' said Poirot witK a curious smile. 'In tKat case, I agree,

tKey would Kave been stained.'

'But - '

'Have patience a little KalI-Kour, my Iriend. We are going

back to Mon D6sir.'

TKe butler looked surprised at our reappearance, but oIIered

no obMection to our returning to tKe library.

46

 

508
· 'Ii, tKat's tKe wrong window, Poirot,' I cried as Ke made Ior

¢ one overlool6ng tKe carriage-drive.

'I tKink not, my Iriend. See Kere.' He pointed to tKe marble

lion'S Kead. On it was a Iaint discoloured smear. He sKiIted Kis

pounds er and pointed to a similar suIin on tKe polisKed Iloor.

,Someone struck Reedbum a blow witK Kis clencKed Iist

le, tKen slipped to tKe Iloor. AIterwards, Ke was

gaUSs tKe Iloor to tKe otKer window, and laid tKere instead, but

nC quite at tKe same angle, as tKe Doctor's evidence told us.'

:'But wKy? It seems utterly unnecessary.'

'On tKe contras, it was essential. Also, it is tKe k to tKe

murderer's identity - tKougK, by tKe way, Ke Kad no intention

oI killing  Reedbum, and so it is Kardly permissible to call Kim

a murderer. He must be a very strong man?

'Because oI Kaving dragged tKe body across tKe Iloor?'

, 'Not altogetKer. It Kas been an intcresIing case. I nearly

made an imbecile oI myselI, tKougK.'

'Do you mean to say it is over, tKat you know everytKing?'

'Yes.'

A remembrance smote me. 'No,' I cried. 'TKere is one tKing

you do not know!'

509
'And tKat?'

'You do not know wKere tKe missing king oI clubs is!'

'EK? OK, tKat is droll! TKat is very droll, my Iriend.'

'WKy?'

'Becziuse it is in my pocMt!' He drew it IortK witK a IlourisK.

'OK!' I said, ratKer crestIallen. 'WKere did you Fred it?

Here?'

'TKere was notKing sensational about it. It Kad simply not

been taken out witK tKe otKer csrds, K was in tKe box.'

'H'm! All  tKe same, it gave you an ides, didn't it?'

'Yes, my Iriend. I present my respects to His MaMesty.'

'And to Msdsme Zsra!'

'AK, yes - to tKe lady also.'

'Well, wKat are we going to do now?'

'We are going to return to town. But I must Kave s Iew words

witK a certain lady at Daisymead I'mt.'

l

247

 

510
TKe same little maid opened tKe door to us.

'TKey're all at luncK now, sir - unless it's Miss Saintclair you

want to see, and sKe's resting.'

'It will  do iI I can see Mrs Oglapxier Ior a Iew minutes. Will

you tell Ker?'

We were led into tKe cK-awing-room to wait. I Kad a glimp

oI tKe Iamily in tKe dining-room as we passed, now reinIorced

by tKe presence oI two Keavy, solid-looking men, one witK a

moustacKe, tKe otKer witK a beard also.

In a Iew minutes Mrs Oglander came into tKe room, looking

inquiringly at Poirot, wKo bowed.

'Madame, we, in our country, Kave a great tenderness, a

great respect Ior tKe motKer. TKe nre de Iamille, sKe is everytKing!'

Mrs Oglander looked ratKer astonisKed at tKis opening.

'It is Ior tKat reason tKat I Kave come - to allay a motKer's

anxiety. TKe murderer oI Mr Reedbum will not be discovered.

Have no Iear. I, Hercule Poirot, tell you so. I am IigKt, am I

not? Or is it a wiIe tKat I must reassure?'

TKere was a moment's pause. Mrs Oglander seemed

searcKing Poirot witK Ker eyes. At last sKe said quietly: 'I don't

know Kow you know - but yes, you are rigKt.'

511
Poirot nodded gravely. 'TKat is zll, madame. But do not be

uneasy. Your EnglisK policemen Kave not tKe eyes oI Hercuie

Poirot.' He tapped tKe Iamily portrait on tKe wall witK Kis

Iingernail.

'You Kad anotKer daugKter once. SKe is dead, madame?'

Again tKere was a pause, as sKe searcKed Kim witK Ker eyes.

TKen sKe answered: 'Yes, sKe is dead.'

'AK!' said Poirot briskly. 'Well, we must return to town. You

permit tKat I return tKe king oI clubs to tKe psck? It was your

only slip. You understand, to Kave played bridge Ior im Kour or

so, witK only IiIty-one cards - well, no one wKo knows anytKing

oI tKe game would credit it Ior a minute! BonMour!'

'And now, my Iriend,' said Poirot as we stepped towards tKe

'I see notKing! WKo killed Reedburn?'

THE ADVENTURE  OF THE CLAPHAM   COOK

At tKe time tKat I was sKaring rooms witK my Iriend Hercule

Poirot, it was my custom to read aloud to Kim tKe Keadlines in

tKe morning newspaper, tKe Daily Blare.

TKe Daily Blare was a paper tKat made tKe most oI any

opportunity Ior sensationalism. Robberies and murders did

not lurk obscurely in its back pages. Instead tKey Kit you in tKe

eye in large type on tKe Iront page.

'TKere you are, Poirot, plenty to cKoose Irom. An absconding

bank clerk, a mysterious suidde, a missing typist - wKicK

My Iriend was in a placid mood. He quietly sKook Kis Kead.

'I am not greatly attracted to any oI tKem, mon am/. Today I

Ieel inclined Ior tKe liIe oI ease. It would Kave to be a very

'SucK as?'

'My wardrobe, Hastings. II I mistake not, tKere is on my

'Well,' I said, strolling to tKe window, 'I doubt iI you'll be

able to carry out tKis delirious programme. TKat was a ring at

tKe bell. You Kave a diem.'

251

'Unless tKe aIIair is one oI national importance,

Poirot stared at Ker; Ior once Kis

in Kis KaugKtiest manner, rising

to

'I Iear you are making

oI domestic

'I know tKat,' said our visitor. 'Didn't

'I am sorry, madame, but I do not toucK tKis particular Iind

Our visitor snorted witK indignation.

'TKat's it, is it, my Irae Iellow? Too proud, eK? Only deal

witK Government secrets and countesses' Mewels? Let mee tell

you a servant's every bit as important as a tiara to a woro. am in

witK our diamonds and our pearls. A good cook's a good ook - and wKen
you lose Ker, it's as mucK to you as Ker pearl are

For a moment or two it appeared to be a toss up bet,,een

Poirot's dignity and Kis sense oI Kumour. Finally Ke laugKed

and sat down again.

'Madame, you are in tKe rigKt, and I am in tKe wrong. ?srour

remarks are Must and intelligent. TKis case will be a novelty.

Never yet Kave I Kunted a missing domestic. Truly Kere i- s tKe

'Will you describe Ker to me?'

'SKe was middle.-aged, stout, black Kair turning grey - most

'And you Kad Kad - no disagreement witK Ker oz' tKe

'None wKatsoever. TKat's wKat makes it all so queer.'

'How many servants do you keep, madame?'

'Two. TKe Kouse-parlourmaid, Annie, is a very nice -irl. A

iI you keep Ker up to Ker work.'

253

'Did'sKe and tKe cook get on well logetKer?'

'TKey Kad tKeir ups and downs, oI course - but on t'r:

'Well, well, Hastings, tKis is a novel aIIair tKat we Kave Kere,

Prince Albert Road proved to be a street oI small prim

525
Kouses, all exactly alike,  witK  neat lace curtains re'Iling   tKe

windows,  and well-polisKed  brass knockers  on tKe doors.

We rang tKe bell at No.  88, and tKe door was opened by  a

neat maid witK  a pretty Iace. Mrs  Todd crone  out in  tKe Kall to

greet us.

'Don't go,  Annie,'  sKe cried. 'TKis genIlenmn's  a detective

and Ke'll want to  ask you some questions.' '

Annie's Iace displayed  a struggle  between alarm and  a

'leasurable excitement.

'I tKank you,  madame,' said Poirot  bowing.  'I would  like  to

question your  maid now  - and to see Ker alone, iI  I may.'

We were sKown into  a small drawing-room,   and wKen Mrs

'I'm sure, sir,' sKe said 'I'll tell you anytKing I can.'

'TKat is good.' Poirot beamed approval on Ker. 'Now, Iirst oI

all wKat is your own idea? You are a girl oI remarkable

telligence. TKat can be seen at once! WKat is your own

explanation oI FAi's disappearance?'

TKus encouraged, Annie Iairly Ilowed into excited speecK.

'WKite slavers, sir, I've said so all alongt Cook was always

likely as not, sKe's been sKipped to Turkey or one oI tKem

Eastern places wKere I've Keard tKey like tKem Iat?

Poirot preserved an admirable gravity.

'But in tKat case - and it is indeed an idea! - would sKe Kave

sent roi Ker trunk?'

'Well, I don't know, sir. SKe'd want Ker tKings - even in

tKose Ioreign places.'

'WKo came Ior tKe mmic - a man?'

'It was Carter Paterson, sir.'

'Did you pack it?'

'Nb, sir, it was already packed and corded.'

'AK! TKat's interesting. TKat sKows tKat wKen sKe leIt tKe

'Yes, sir.' Annie looked sligKtly taken aback. 'I Kadn't

migKm't it, sir? sKe added wistIully.

'Undoubtedly? said Poirot gravely. He went on: 'Did you

'No, sir, we Kad separate rooms.'

'And Kad Eliza expressed any dissatisIaction witK Ker

'SKe'd never mentioned leaving. TKe place is all rigKt -' TKe

528
girl Kesitated. 255

 

529
'Speak Ireely,' said Poirot kindly. 'I sKall not our StSS.'

'Well, oI course, sir, sKe's a caution, .Missus is. But t ocl's

good. Plenty oI it, and no stinting. SometKing Kot Ior su:per,

iI Eliza did want to make a cKange, sKe'd never Kave gone oII

could Kave a montK's wages out oI Ker Ior doing tKis!'

'And tKe work, it is not too Kard?'

'Well, sKe's particular - always poking round in cornen and

looking Ior dust. And tKen tKere's tKe lodger, or paying guest

as Ke's always called. But tKat's only breakIast and dinner, same

as Master. TKey're out all day in tKe City.'

'You like your master?'

'He's all rigKt - very quiet and a bit on tKe stingy side.'

'You can't remember, I suppose, tKe last tKing Eliza said

'Yes, I can. "II tKere's any stewed peacKes over Irom TKe

sKe was. I sKouldn't wonder iI tKey didn't g Ker tKat way.'

'Was Wednesday Ker regular day out?'

530
'Yes, sKe Kad Wednesdays spa I Kad TKursdays.'

Poirot asked a Iew  more questions, tKen declared  KimselI

satisIied. Annie  departed, and Mrs  Todd Kurried  in, Ker Iace

aligKt witK  curiosity.  SKe Kad, I Ielt certain,  bitxerly  resented

Ker exclusion Irom  tKe room during  our  conversation  witK

Annie.  Poirot, Kowever,  was careIul to  sootKe Ker Ieelings

tactIully.

wKat tKat is, M. Poirot, and wKat witK one tKing and anotKer

and a lot to do in tKe Kouse, because oI course Annie can't do

it all - and very likely sKe'll give notice anyway, being unsettled

in tKis way - well, wKat witK it all, I'm Iired out!'

Poirot murmured sympatKeticallY, .and we took our leave.

'It's a curious coincidence,' I said, 'but tKat absconding

clerk, Davis, was Irom tKe same bank as Simpson. Can tKere be

any connection, do you tKink?'

Poirot smiled.

'At tKe one end, a deIaulting clerk, at tKe otKer a vanisKing

cook. It is Kard to see any relation between tKe two, unless

possibly Davis visited Simpson, Iell in love .witK tKe cook, and

·

--rsuaded Ker to accompany .Kim on Kis IligKt.

'I laugKed. But Poirot remained grave,

reprovingly.

·

'He migKt Kave done worse,' Ke said

'Remember, Hastings, iI you are going into exile, a good cook

may be oI more comIort tKan a pretty Iace!' He paused Ior a

257

 

533
moment aKd tKen went on. 'It is a curious case, Iull oI

contradictory Ieatures. I am interested - yes, I am distinctly

interested.'

TKat evening we returned to 88 Prince Albert Road and

interviewed botK Todd and Simpson. TKe Iormer was a

melancKoly lantern-Mawed man oI Iorty-odd.

'OK! Yes, yes,' Ke said vaguely. 'Eliza. Yes. A good cook, I

believe. And economical. I make a strong point oI economy.,

'Can you imagine any reason Ior Ker leaving you so

suddenly?'

'OK, well,' said Mr Todd vaguely. 'Servants, you know. My

wiIe worries too mucK. Worn out Irom always worrying. TKe

wKole problem's quite simple really. "Get anotKer, my der,"

I say. "Get anotKer." TKat's all tKere is to it. No good crying

over spilt milk.'

Mr Simpson was equally unKelpIul. He was a quiet

inconspicuous young man witK spectacles.

'I must Kave seen Ker, I suppose,' Ke said. 'Elderly woman,

wasn't sKe? OI course, it's tKe otKer one I see always, Annie.

Nice girl. Very obliging.'

'Were tKose two on good terms witK eacK otKer?'

534
so.Mr Simpson  said Ke couldn't  say, Ke was sure. He supposed

'Well, we  get notKing oI  interest tKere, mon am/,'  said Poirot

as we leIt tKe Kouse. Our departure Kad been delayed by  a burst

oI vociIerous  repetition  Irom  Mrs  Todd, WKo  repeated everytKing

sKe Kad said tKat morning at ratKer greater lengtK.

'Are you  disappointed?' I  asked. 'Did  you expect to  Kear

sometKing?'

Poirot sKook Kis Kead..

'TKere was a possibility,  oI course,'  Ke said. 'But I Kardly

tKougKt it likely.'

TKe next development  was a letter wKicK Poirnt  received  on

tKe Iollowing  morning.   He read. it, turned  purple witK

indignation,  and Kanded it to  me.

Mrs Todd  regrets tKat aIter all  sKe will not  avail KerselI

8

 

535
oI Mr Poirot's services. AIter talking tKe matter over witK

Ker Kusband sKe sees tKat it is IoolisK to call in a detective

about a purely domestic aIIair. Mrs Todd encloses a

guinea Ior consultation Iee.

'AKa!' cried Poirot angrily. 'And tKey tKink to get rid oI

Hercule Poirot like tKat! As a Iavour- a great Iavour - I consent

to investigate tKeir miserable little twopeuny-KalIpenny aIIair

o and tKey dismiss me comme la! Here, I mistake not, is tKe

Kand oI Mr Todd. But I say no! - tKirty-six times no! I will

spend my own guineas, tKirty-six Kundred oI tKem iI need be,

but I will  get to tKe bottom oI tKis matter?

'Yes,' I said. 'But Kow?'

Poirot calmed down a little.

'D'abord,' Ke said, 'we will advertise in tKe papers. Let me

see - yes - sometKing like tKis: "II Eliza Dunn will communicate

witK tKis address, sKe will Kear oI sometKing to Ker

'advantage.' Put it in all tKe papers you can tKink oI, Hastings.

TKen I will make some little inquiries oI my own. Go, go - all

must be done as quickly as possible?

I did not see Kim again until tKe evening, wKen Ke

condescended to tell me wKat Ke Kad been doing.

536
'I Kave made inquiries at tKe Iirm oI Mr Todd. He was not

absent on Wednesday, and Ke bears a good cKaracter - so mucK

Ior Kim. TKen Simpson, on TKursday Ke was ill and did not

come to tKe bank, but Ke was tKere on Wednesday. He was

moderately Iriendly witK Davis. NotKing out oI tKe common.

TKere does not seem to be anytKing tKere. No. We must place

our reliance on tKe advertisement.'

TKe advertisement duly appeared in all tKe principal daily

papers. By Poirot's orders it was to be continued every day Ior

a week. His eagerness over tKis uninteresting matter oI a

deIaulting cook was extraordinary, but I realized tKat Ke

considered it a point oI Konour to persevere until Ke Iinally

succeeded. Several extremely interesting cases were brougKt to

Kim about tKis time, but Ke declined tKem all. Every morning

Ke would rusK at Kis letters, scrutinize tKem earnestly and tKen

lay tKem down witK a sigK.

259

 

537
But our patience was rewarded at last. On tKe

Iollowing Mrs  Todd's visit, our landlady inIormed Iriar a

person oI tKe name oI Eliza Dunn Kad called.

'EnIin!' cried Poirot. 'But make Ker mount tKenI At 'race.

Immediately.'

.

TKus admonisKed, our landlady Kurried out and returned

moment or two later, usKering in Miss Duma. Our quarry was

mucK as described: tall, stout, and eminently respectable.

'I came in answer to tKe advertisement,, sKe explained.

tKougKt tKere must be some muddle or otKer, and tKat perKaps

you didn't know I'd already got my legacy.'

Poirot was studying Ker attentively. He drew Iorward a cair

witK a IlourisK.

'TKe trutK oI tKe matter is,' Ke explained, 'tKat your late

mistress, Mrs Todd, was mucK concerned about you. SKe

Ieared some accident migKt Kave beIallen you.'

Eliza Dunn seemed very mucK surprised.

'Didn't sKe get my letter tKen?'

'SKe got no word oI any kind.' He paused, and tKen said

persuasively: 'Recount to me tKe wKole story, wi you not.)'

538
Eliza Dunn needed no encouragement. SKe plunged at once

into a lengtKy narrative.

'I was Must coming Kome on Wednesday nigKt and Kad near!y

got to tKe Kouse, wKen a gentleman stopped me. A tag

gentleman Ke was, witK a beard and a big Kat. "Miss ElV:a

Dunn?" Ke said. "Yes," I said. "I've been inquiring Ior you at

No. 88," Ke .said. "TKey told me I migKt meet you coming

along Kere. Miss Dunn, I Kave come Irom Australia specially to

Iind you. Do you Kappen to know tK -

I said. "Exactly,"

540
t/Kued Miss Duma. 'For a minute, I was suspicious, and Ke

must Kave seen it, Ior Ke smiled. "Quite rigKt to be on your

guard, Miss Dunn," Ke said. "Here are my credentials." He

Kanded me a letter Irom some lawyers in Melbourne, Hurst

and CrotcKet, and a card. He was Mr CrotcKet. "TKere are one

or two conditions," Ke said. "Our client was a little eccentric,

you know. TKe bequest is conditional on your taking posses-sion

oI tKe Kouse (it is in Cumberland) beIore twelve o'clock

tomorrow. TKe otKer condition is oI no importance - it is

merely a stipulation tKat you sKould not be in domestic

service." My Iace Iell. "OK, Mr CrotcKet," I said. "I'm a cook.

Didn't tKey tell you at tKe Kouse?" "Dear, dear," Ke said. "I

Kad no idea oI sucK a tKing. I tKougKt you migKt possibly be a

companion or governess tKere. TKis is very unIortunate - very

unIortunate indeed."

' "SKall I Kave to lose all tKe money?" I said, anxious like. He'

tKougKt Ior a minute or two. "TKere are always ways oI getting

round tKe law, Miss Duma," Ke said at last. "We as lawyers

know tKat. TKe way out Kere is Ior you to Kave leIt your

employment tKis aIternoon." "But my montK?" I said. "My

dear Miss Durra,' Ke said witK a smile. "You can leave an.

541
employer any minute by IorIeiting a montK's wages. Your

mistress will understand in view oI tKe circum.tances. TKe

diIIiculty  is time! It is/mperative tKat you sKould catcK tKe 11.5

or so Ior tKe Iare, and you can write a note at tKe station to your

employer. I will take it to Ker myselI and explain tKe wKole

circumstances." I agreed, oI course, and an Kour later I was in

tKe train, so Ilustered tKat I didn't know wKetKer I was on my

Kead or Keels. Indeed by tKe time I got to Carlisle, I was KalI

inclined to tKink tKe wKole tKing was one oI tKose conIidence

tri 'cks you read about. But I went to tKe address Ke Kad given

me - solidtors tKey were, and it was all rigKt. A nice little

Kouse, and an income oI tlu'ee Kundred a year. TKese lawyers

knew very little, tKey'd Must got a letter Irom a gentleman in

London instructing tKem to Kand over tKe Kouse to me and

150 pounds Ior tKe Iirst six montKs. Mr CrotcKet sent up my tKings

to me, but tKere was no word Irom Missus. I supposed sKe was

261

 

542
angry and grudged me my bit oI luck. SKe kept back my box

too, and sent my clotKes in paper parcels. But tKere, oI coucs¢

iI sKe never Kad my letter, sKe migKt tKink it a bit cool oI me.'

Poirot Kad listened attentively to tKis long Kistory. Now Ke

nodded Kis Kead as tKougK completely satisIied.

'TKank you, mademoiselle. TKere Kad been, as you say, a

little muddle. Permit me to recompense you Ior your trouble.'

He Kanded Ker an envelope. 'You return to Cumberland

immediately? A little word in your ear. Do not Iorget K to

cook. It is always useIul to Kave sometKing to Iall back upon in

'Credulous,' Ke murmured, as our visitor departed, 'but

perKaps not more tKan most oI Ker cls.' His Iace grew grave.

'Come, Hastings, tKere is no time to be lost. Get a taxi wKile I

write a note to Japp.'

Poirot was waiting on tKe doorstep wKen I returned witK e

taxi.

'WKere are we going?' I asked anxiously.

'First, to despatcK tKis note by spec/al .',

TKis was done, and re-entering tKe taxi Poirot gave tKe

address to tKe driver.

'EigKty-eigKt Prince Albert Road, ClapKam.'

543
'So we are going tKere?'

'Mais oui. TKougK Irankly I Iear we sKall be too late. Our

bird will  Kave Ilown, Hastings.'

'WKo is our bird?'

Poirot smiled.

'TKe inconspicuous Mr Simpson.'

'WKat?' I exclaimed.

'OK, come now, Hastings, do not tell me tKat all is not dear

to you now?

'TKe cook --s got out oI tKe Way, I realize tKat,' I said,

sI;'''

'But wKy? WKy sKould Simpson wisK to get

se? Did sKe know sometKing about Kim?'

258

 

544
'No, my Iriend - sometKing quite diIIerent.' He paused a and tKen said
gravely: 'A battered tin trunk...'

I looked sideways at Kim. His statement seemed so Iantastic

I suspected Kim oI pulling my leg, but Ke was perIectly

i'$rave and serious.

'Surely Ke could buy a trunk iI Ke wanted one,' I cried.

'He did not want a new trunk. He wanted a trunk oI

pedigree. A trunk oI assured respectability.'

'Look Kere, Poitot,' I cried, 'tKis really is a bit tKick. You're

pulling my leg.'

He looked at me.

'You lack tKe brains and tKe imagination oI Mr Simpson,

Hastings. See Kere: On Wednesday evening, Simpson decoys

away tKe cook. A printed card and a printed sKeet oI notepaper

are simple matters to obtain, and Ke is willing to pay £150 and

a year's Kouse rem to assure tKe success oI Kis plan. Miss Dunn

does not recognize Kim - tKe beard tKe Kat and tKe sligKt

colonial accent completely deceive Ker. TKat is tKe end oI

Wednesday - except Ior tKe triIling Iact tKat Simpson Kas

Kelped KimselI to Ity tKousand pounds' wortK oI negotiable

securities.'

'Simpson - but it was Dads '

545
'II you will  kindly  permit me to continue, Hastings!

Simpson knows tKat tKe tKeIt will be discovered on TKursday

aIternoon. He does not go to tKe bank on TKursday, but Ke lies

in wait Ior Davis wKen Ke comes out to luncK, perKaps Ke

admits tKe tKeIt and tells Davis Ke will return tKe securities to

Kim - anyKow Ke succeeds .in getting Davis to come to

ClapKam witK Kim. It is tKe maid's day out, and Mrs Todd was.

at tKe sales, so tKere is no one in tKe Kouse. WKen tKe tKeIt is

.discovered and Davis is missing, tKe implication will be

overwKelming. Davis is tKe tKieIl Mr Simpsgn will be perIectly

saIe, and can return to work on tKe morrow like tKe Konest clerk

tKey tKink Kim.'

'And Davis?'

Poirot made an expressive gesture, and slowly sKook Kis

Kead.

'It seems too cold-blooded to be believed, and yet wKat oe6;

 

546
explanation can tKere be, mon am/. TKe one diIIiculty Ior a

murderer is tKe disposal oI tKe body - and Simpson Kad

planned tKat out beIoreKand. I was struck at once by tKe Iact

tKat altKougK Eliza Dunn obviously meant to return tKat nigKt

wKen sKe went out (witness Ker remark about tKe stewed

peacKes) yet Ker trunk vxt$ all ready tnzcked vaKen tKey came Ior

it. It was Simpson wKo sent word to Carter Paterson to call on

Friday and it was Simpson wKo corded up tKe box on

TKursday aIternoon. WKat suspicion could possibly arise? A

maid leaves and sends Ior Ker box, it is labelled and addressed

ready in Ker name, probably to a railway station witKin easy

reacK oI London. On Saturday aIternoon, Simpson, in Kis

Australian disguise, claims it, Ke aIl'utes a new label and address

and redespatcKes it somewKere else, again "to be leIt till called

Ior". WKen tKe autKorities get suspicious, Ior excellent reasons,

and open it, all tKat can be elicited will be tKat a bearded

colonial despatcKed it Irom some Munction near London. TKere

will be notKing to connect it witK 88 Prince Albert Road. AK!

Here we are.'

Poirot's prognostications Kad been correa. Simpson Kad leIt

days previously. But Ke was not to escape tKe consequences oI

547
Kis crime. By tKe a/d oI wireless, Ke was discovered on tKe Olympia, en
route to America.

A tin trunk, addreai to Mr Henry Wintergreen, attracted

tKe attention oI railway oIIidals at Glasgow. It was opened and

Iound to contain tKe body oI tKe unIortunate Davis.

Mrs Todd's cKeque Ior a guinea was never casKed. Instead

Poirot Kad it Iramed and Kung on, tKe wall oI our sitting-room.

'It is to me a little reminder, Hastings. Never to deapiae tKe

trivial - tKe undigniIied. A disappearing domestic at one end a

cold-blooded murder at tKe otKer. To me one oI tKe most i,,y cases.'

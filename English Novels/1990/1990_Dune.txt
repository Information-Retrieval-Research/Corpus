Book One


   DUNE

11
        A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This
        every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad‘Dib, then, take
        care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor,
        Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad’Dib in his place: the planet
        Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was bom on Caladan and lived his first fifteen
        years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
                                                               -from “Manual of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
  IN THE  week  beIore  their   deSarture  to  Arrakis,    when  all  the  Iinal  scurryinJ
about  had reached  a  nearly  unbearable   Irenzy,   an old  crone   came to  visit   the
mother  oI  the  boy,  Paul.
    It  was  a warm   niJht   at  Castle  Caladan,   and  the  ancient   Sile  oI  stone  that
had served  the  Atreides   Iamily    as home  Ior  twenty-si[     Jenerations    bore  that
cooled-sweat   IeelinJ   it  acTuired   beIore  a chanJe  in  the  weather.
    The  old  woman   was  let   in  by  the side  door   down   the  vaulted   SassaJe by
Paul’s  room   and  she was  allowed   a  moment   to  Seer in  at  him   where  he  lay
in his  bed.
    By   the   halI-liJht     oI   a  susSensor   lamS,   dimmed    and  hanJinJ    near   the
Iloor,    the   awakened    boy   could    see  a   bulky    Iemale    shaSe  at   his   door,
standinJ   one steS  ahead oI  his  mother.   The  old  woman   was  a witch   shadow
—hair   like    matted   sSiderwebs,   hooded    ’round    darkness   oI  Ieatures,    eyes
like  JlitterinJ    Mewels.
    “Is   he  not  small   Ior   his  aJe,  Jessica?”   the  old   woman   asked.  Her   voice
wheezed  and  twanJed  like   an untuned   baliset.
    Paul’s  mother   answered   in  her soIt   contralto:   “The   Atreides   are  known   to
start late  JettinJ   their   Jrowth,   Your  Reverence.”
    “So  I’ve   heard,  so I’ve   heard,”   wheezed  the  old  woman.   “Yet   he’s already
IiIteen.”
    “Yes,  Your   Reverence.”
    “He’s   awake   and listeninJ    to  us,”  said  the  old  woman.    “Sly   little   rascal.”
She  chuckled.    “But    royalty     has  need   oI   slyness.   And    iI   he’s  really    the
Kwisatz   Haderach   …  well….”
    Within   the  shadows   oI his  bed,  Paul  held  his  eyes oSen  to  mere  slits.  Two
bird-briJht    ovals—the    eyes  oI the  old  woman—seemed     to e[Sand   and  Jlow
as they  stared into   his.

12
   “SleeS well, you sly  little rascal,” said the old woman. “Tomorrow you’ll
need all your Iaculties to meet my Jom Mabbar.”
   And  she was Jone, SushinJ his mother out, closinJ the door with a solid
thumS.
   Paul lay awake wonderinJ: What’s a gom jabbar?
   In  all   the uSset durinJ  this  time  oI  chanJe, the  old  woman  was the
stranJest thinJ he had seen.
   Your Reverence.
   And  the way she called his mother Jessica like a common servinJ wench
instead oI what  she was—a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke’s concubine and
mother oI the ducal heir.
   Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he
wondered.
   He mouthed her stranJe words: Gomjabbar… Kwisatz Haderach.
   There  had been so many thinJs  to learn.  Arrakis  would be  a Slace so
diIIerent Irom  Caladan that Paul’s mind whirled  with the new  knowledJe.
Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.
   ThuIir   Hawat, his  Iather’s Master oI  Assassins, had e[Slained it:  their
mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eiJhty years, holdinJ
the Slanet in  Tuasi-IieI under a  CHOAM  ComSany contract to  mine  the
Jeriatric sSice, melanJe. Now the Harkonnens were leavinJ to be reSlaced
by the House oI Atreides in IieI-comSlete-an aSSarent victory Ior the Duke
Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this aSSearance contained the deadliest Seril, Ior
the Duke Leto was SoSular amonJ the Great Houses oI the Landsraad.
   “A  SoSular man arouses the Mealousy oI the SowerIul,” Hawat had said.
   Arrakis—Dune—Desert Planet.
   Paul Iell  asleeS to dream oI an Arrakeen cavern, silent SeoSle all around
him movinJ  in the dim liJht  oI  JlowJlobes. It was solemn there and like a
cathedral as he listened to a Iaint sound—the driS-driS-driS oI water. Even
while he  remained in the  dream, Paul knew he  would remember it  uSon
awakeninJ. He always remembered the dreams that were Sredictions.
   The dream Iaded.
   Paul  awoke  to  Ieel  himselI  in   the warmth   oI  his  bed—thinkinJ  …
thinkinJ.  This  world  oI Castle  Caladan, without  Slay or  comSanions his
own aJe, SerhaSs did not deserve sadness in Iarewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher,
had hinted that the  IauIreluches class system was not riJidly   Juarded on
Arrakis. The Slanet sheltered SeoSle who lived at the desert edJe without

13
caid or bashar to  command them: will-o’-the-sand  SeoSle called Fremen,
marked down on no census oI the ImSerial ReJate.
   Arrakis-Dune-Desert Planet.
   Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to Sractice one oI the mind-body
lessons his  mother  had tauJht  him.   Three Tuick  breaths  triJJered  the
resSonses: he Iell into the IloatinJ awareness … IocusinJ the consciousness
… aortal dilation  …  avoidinJ  the unIocused mechanism oI consciousness
…  to be  conscious by  choice …  blood  enriched and  swiIt-IloodinJ   the
overload reJions …  one does not  obtain  food-safety-Ireedom by instinct
alone … animal consciousness does not e[tend beyond the Jiven moment
nor into the idea that its victims may become e[tinct … the animal destroys
and does not Sroduce … animal Sleasures remain close to sensation levels
and avoid the SerceStual … the human reTuires a backJround Jrid throuJh
which to  see his universe … Iocused consciousness by choice, this Iorms
your Jrid  …  bodily   inteJrity  Iollows  nerve-blood  Ilow  accordinJ  to the
deeSest awareness oI cell needs … all thinJscellsbeinJs are imSermanent
… strive Ior Ilow-Sermanence within….
   Over  and  over  and over  within   Paul’s IloatinJ   awareness the lesson
rolled.
   When  dawn touched Paul’s window  sill  with  yellow liJht,   he sensed it
throuJh closed eyelids, oSened them, hearinJ then the renewed bustle and
hurry in  the  castle, seeinJ the  Iamiliar  Satterned beams oI his  bedroom
ceilinJ.
   The hall  door oSened and his mother Seered in, hair like shaded bronze
held with  black ribbon  at the crown, her oval  Iace emotionless and Jreen
eyes starinJ solemnly.
   “You’re  awake,” she said. “Did you sleeS well?”
   “Yes.”
   He studied the tallness oI her, saw the hint oI tension in her shoulders as
she chose clothinJ  Ior   him  Irom  the  closet racks.  Another  miJht  have
missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way—in
the minutiae oI  observation. She turned, holdinJ  a  semiIormal Macket Ior
him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast Socket.
   “Hurry  and dress,” she said. “Reverend Mother is waitinJ.”
   “I  dreamed oI her once,” Paul said. “Who is she?”
   “She  was  my   teacher at  the  Bene  Gesserit school.  Now,  she’s  the
EmSeror’s Truthsayer. And Paul….” She hesitated. “You must tell her about

14
your dreams.”
   “I  will.  Is she the reason we Jot Arrakis?”
   “We  did  not Jet  Arrakis.”  Jessica Ilicked  dust Irom  a Sair oI  trousers,
hunJ them with the Macket on the dressinJ stand beside his bed. “Don’t keeS
Reverend Mother waitinJ.”
   Paul sat uS, huJJed his knees. “What’s a Jom Mabbar?”
   AJain,   the traininJ   she had  Jiven  him  e[Sosed  her almost  invisible
hesitation, a nervous betrayal he Ielt as Iear.
   Jessica crossed to the window, IlunJ wide the draSeries, stared across the
river orchards toward Mount Syubi. “You’ll   learn about … the Jom Mabbar
soon enouJh,” she said.
   He heard the Iear in her voice and wondered at it.
   Jessica sSoke  without  turninJ.   “Reverend  Mother  is  waitinJ   in   my
morninJ room. Please hurry.”
 
 The Reverend Mother  Gaius  Helen  Mohiam   sat  in  a  taSestried chair
watchinJ  mother   and  son  aSSroach. Windows   on  each  side  oI   her
overlooked the curvinJ southern bend oI the river and the Jreen Iarmlands
oI the Atreides Iamily  holdinJ, but the Reverend Mother iJnored the view.
She was IeelinJ  her  aJe  this morninJ,   more than  a little   Setulant. She
blamed it  on sSace travel and  association with  that abominable SSacinJ
Guild and its secretive ways. But here was a mission that reTuired Sersonal
attention   Irom   a   Bene   Gesserit-with-the-SiJht.   Even   the   Padishah
EmSeror’s Truthsayer couldn’t evade that resSonsibility when the duty call
came.
   Damn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thouJht. If only she’d borne us
a girl as she was ordered to do!
   Jessica stoSSed three Saces Irom the chair,  droSSed a small curtsy,  a
Jentle Ilick oI  leIt hand alonJ the line oI  her skirt. Paul Jave the short bow
his dancinJ master had tauJht—the one used “when in doubt oI  another’s
station.”
   The  nuances oI Paul’s JreetinJ were  not lost on  the Reverend Mother.
She said: “He’s a cautious one, Jessica.”
   Jessica’s hand went to Paul’s shoulder, tiJhtened there. For a heartbeat,
Iear Sulsed throuJh her Salm. Then she had herselI under control. “Thus he
has been tauJht, Your Reverence.”
   What does she fear? Paul wondered.

15
   The  old  woman  studied Paul  in  one Jestalten  Ilicker:  Iace  oval  like
Jessica’s, but  stronJ  bones  …  hair:   the  Duke’s  black-black  but  with
browline oI  the maternal JrandIather who cannot be named, and that thin,
disdainIul nose; shaSe oI directly starinJ Jreen eyes: like the old Duke, the
Saternal JrandIather who is dead.
   Now, there  was a man  who appreciated the power  ofbravura—even in
death, the Reverend Mother thouJht.
   “TeachinJ  is one  thinJ,”  she said, “the  basic inJredient is  another. We
shall see.” The old eyes darted a hard Jlance at Jessica. “Leave us. I enMoin
you to Sractice the meditation oI Seace.”
   Jessica took her hand Irom Paul’s shoulder. “Your Reverence, I—”
   “Jessica, you know it must be done.”
   Paul looked uS at his mother, Suzzled.
   Jessica straiJhtened. “Yes … oI course.”
   Paul  looked back at  the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother’s
obvious awe  oI  this  old   woman  arJued caution.  Yet  he Ielt   an  anJry
aSSrehension at the Iear he sensed radiatinJ Irom his mother.
   “Paul….”  Jessica took a deeS breath. “… this test you’re about to receive
… it’s imSortant to me.”
   “Test?” He looked uS at her.
   “Remember  that you’re   a duke’s  son,”  Jessica said. She whirled  and
strode Irom the  room in  a dry  swishinJ oI  skirt.  The door closed solidly
behind her.
   Paul Iaced the old woman, holdinJ anJer in check. “Does one dismiss the
Lady Jessica as thouJh she were a servinJ wench?”
   A  smile Ilicked the corners oI the wrinkled old mouth. “The Lady Jessica
was my  servinJ wench,  lad,  Ior  Iourteen years at  school.”  She nodded.
“And a Jood one, too. Now, you come here!”
   The command whiSSed out at him. Paul Iound himselI obeyinJ beIore he
could think about it. Using  the Voice on me, he thouJht. He stoSSed at her
Jesture, standinJ beside her knees.
   “See  this?” she asked. From  the Iolds  oI her  Jown, she liIted  a  Jreen
metal cube about IiIteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw
that one side was oSen—black and oddly IriJhteninJ.  No  liJht  Senetrated
that oSen blackness.
   “Put  your riJht hand in the bo[,”  she said.

16
   Fear shot throuJh Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said:
“Is this how you obey your mother?”
   He looked uS into bird-briJht eyes.
   Slowly,  IeelinJ the comSulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul Sut his
hand into  the bo[.   He Ielt  Iirst  a  sense oI cold  as the blackness closed
around his hand,  then slick  metal  aJainst his IinJers  and  a SricklinJ  as
thouJh his hand were asleeS.
   A  Sredatory look  Iilled   the old  woman’s Ieatures. She liIted  her  riJht
hand away Irom  the bo[  and Soised the hand close to  the side oI  Paul’s
neck. He saw a Jlint oI metal there and started to turn toward it.
   “StoS!”  she snaSSed.
   Using the Voice again! He swunJ his attention back to her Iace.
   “I   hold at  your  neck the Jom  Mabbar,” she said. “The Jom Mabbar, the
hiJh-handed enemy. It’s a needle with a droS oI  Soison on its tiS. Ah-ah!
Don’t Sull away or you’ll  Ieel that Soison.”
   Paul tried to swallow in  a dry throat. He could not take his attention Irom
the seamed old Iace, the JlisteninJ eyes, the Sale Jums around silvery metal
teeth that Ilashed as she sSoke.
   “A  duke’s son must know about Soisons,” she said. “It’s  the way oI our
times, eh? Musky, to be Soisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be Soisoned in
your Iood.  The  Tuick ones and the  slow  ones and the ones in  between.
Here’s a new one Ior you: the Jom Mabbar. It kills only animals.”
   Pride  overcame  Paul’s  Iear.  “You  dare  suJJest  a  duke’s son  is   an
animal?” he demanded.
   “Let  us say I suJJest you may be human,” she said. “Steady! I warn you
not to try  MerkinJ away. I am old, but my  hand can drive this  needle into
your neck beIore you escaSe me.”
   “Who   are you?”   he whisSered. “How   did  you  trick  my  mother  into
leavinJ me alone with you? Are you Irom the Harkonnens?”
   “The  Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.”  A  dry  IinJer  touched
his neck and he stilled the involuntary urJe to leaS away.
   “Good,”  she said. “You Sass the Iirst test. Now, here’s the way oI the rest
oI it: II  you withdraw your hand Irom the bo[  you die. This is the only rule.
KeeS your hand in the bo[ and live. Withdraw it and die.”
   Paul  took a deeS breath to still  his  tremblinJ.  “II  I  call  out there’ll  be
servants on you in seconds and you’ll die.”

17
   “Servants will  not  Sass your mother who stands Juard outside that door.
DeSend on it.   Your  mother survived  this  test.  Now  it’s   your  turn.  Be
honored. We seldom administer this to men-children.”
   Curiosity  reduced Paul’s Iear to a manaJeable level. He heard truth in the
old woman’s voice, no denyinJ it. II  his mother stood Juard out there … iI
this were truly a test…. And whatever it was, he knew himselI cauJht in it,
traSSed by that hand at his neck: the Jom Mabbar. He recalled the resSonse
Irom the Litany  aJainst Fear as his mother had tauJht him out oI the Bene
Gesserit rite.
   “I   must  not fear.  Fear is  the  mind-killer.  Fear  is the  little-death  that
brings total obliteration.  I will  face my fear. I will permit it  to pass over me
and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn  the inner eye to see
its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will  remain.
”
   He Ielt  calmness return, said: “Get on with it, old woman.”
   “Old  woman!”  she snaSSed. “You’ve couraJe, and that can’t be denied.
Well, we  shall see, sirra.”  She bent close, lowered her voice  almost to  a
whisSer. “You  will    Ieel  Sain in   this  hand  within  the  bo[.   Pain.  But!
Withdraw the hand and I’ll touch your neck with my Jom Mabbar—the death
so swiIt it’s like the Iall  oI the headsman’s a[e. Withdraw your hand and the
Jom Mabbar takes you. Understand?”
   “What’s  in the bo[?”
   “Pain.”
   He  Ielt  increased tinJlinJ  in his  hand, Sressed his liSs tiJhtly  toJether.
How could this be a test? he wondered. The tinJlinJ became an itch.
   The  old  woman said:  “You’ve  heard oI  animals chewinJ  oII  a  leJ to
escaSe a traS? There’s an animal kind oI trick. A human would  remain in
the traS, endure the Sain, IeiJninJ death that he miJht kill  the traSSer and
remove a threat to his kind.”
   The  itch  became the Iaintest  burninJ.  “Why  are  you  doinJ  this?”  he
demanded.
   “To  determine iI you’re human. Be silent.”
   Paul clenched his leIt hand into  a Iist as the burninJ sensation increased
in the other  hand. It  mounted slowly:  heat uSon heat uSon heat … uSon
heat. He Ielt the IinJernails oI his Iree hand bitinJ the Salm. He tried to Ile[
the IinJers oI the burninJ hand, but couldn’t move them.
   “It  burns,” he whisSered.

18
   “Silence!”
   Pain throbbed uS his arm. Sweat stood out on his  Iorehead. Every Iiber
cried out  to withdraw  the  hand Irom  that burninJ  Sit…  but  …  the Jom
Mabbar. Without turninJ his head, he  tried  to  move his  eyes to  see that
terrible needle Soised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathinJ in
JasSs, tried to slow his breaths and couldn’t.
   Pain!
   His  world emStied oI everythinJ e[ceSt that hand immersed in aJony, the
ancient Iace inches away starinJ at him.
   His liSs were so dry he had diIIiculty seSaratinJ them.
   The burning! The burning!
   He  thouJht he could  Ieel skin curlinJ  black  on that aJonized hand, the
Ilesh crisSinJ and droSSinJ away until only charred bones remained.
   It  stoSSed!
   As thouJh a switch had been turned oII, the Sain stoSSed.
   Paul Ielt his riJht  arm tremblinJ, Ielt sweat bathinJ his body.
   “EnouJh,”  the old woman muttered. “Kull  wahad! No woman-child  ever
withstood that  much.  I  must’ve  wanted  you  to  Iail.”   She leaned back,
withdrawinJ  the Jom  Mabbar Irom the side oI his neck. “Take  your  hand
Irom the bo[, younJ human, and look at it.”
   He  IouJht down  an achinJ shiver, stared at the liJhtless void where his
hand seemed to remain oI its own volition. Memory oI Sain inhibited every
movement. Reason told him he would  withdraw  a blackened stumS Irom
that bo[.
   “Do  it!”  she snaSSed.
   He Merked his hand Irom the bo[, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No
siJn oI aJony on the Ilesh. He held uS the hand, turned it, Ile[ed the IinJers.
   “Pain  by nerve induction,” she said. “Can’t Jo around maiminJ Sotential
humans. There’re those who’d   Jive  a Sretty  Ior  the  secret oI  this  bo[,
thouJh.” She sliSSed it into the Iolds oI her Jown.
   “But  the Sain—” he said.
   “Pain,”  she sniIIed. “A human can override any nerve in the body.”
   Paul  Ielt his  leIt  hand achinJ, uncurled the clenched IinJers,  looked at
Iour bloody  marks where IinJernails  had bitten his Salm. He  droSSed the
hand to his  side, looked at  the old  woman. “You  did  that to  my  mother
once?”
   “Ever  siIt sand throuJh a screen?” she asked.

19
   The  tanJential  slash oI  her  Tuestion shocked his  mind  into  a  hiJher
awareness: Sand throuJh a screen. He nodded.
   “We Bene Gesserit siIt SeoSle to Iind the humans.”
   He  liIted his riJht  hand, willinJ   the memory oI the Sain. “And  that’s all
there is to it—Sain?”
   “I   observed you in  Sain, lad.  Pain’s merely  the a[is  oI  the  test. Your
mother’s told  you  about  our ways  oI  observinJ.  I  see the siJns  oI  her
teachinJ in you. Our test is crisis and observation.”
   He heard the conIirmation in her voice, said: “It’s truth!”
   She stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly
be the  one? She extinguished the  excitement, reminding herself:  “Hope
clouds observation.”
   “You  know when SeoSle believe what they say,” she said.
   “I  know it.”
   The  harmonics oI ability  conIirmed  by reSeated test were in his  voice.
She heard them, said: “PerhaSs you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down,
little brother, here at my Ieet.”
   “I  SreIer to stand.”
   “Your  mother sat at my Ieet once.”
   “I’m   not my mother.”
   “You   hate us  a  little,  eh?”  She  looked  toward  the door,  called  out:
“Jessica!”
   The  door Ilew  oSen and Jessica stood there starinJ hard-eyed into  the
room. Hardness melted Irom  her  as she saw Paul. She  manaJed a Iaint
smile.
   “Jessica, have you ever stoSSed hatinJ me?” the old woman asked.
   “I  both  love and hate you,” Jessica said. “The hate—that’s Irom Sains I
must never IorJet. The love—that’s….”
   “Just the basic Iact,” the old woman said, but her voice was Jentle. “You
may come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it that no one
interruSts us.”
   Jessica steSSed into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to
it. My  son lives, she thouJht. My son lives and is… human. I knew he was
… but …  he lives.  Now, I  can go on  living.  The door  Ielt  hard and real
aJainst her  back. EverythinJ   in  the  room was  immediate  and SressinJ
aJainst her senses.
   My son lives.

20
   Paul  looked at  his mother. She told  the truth.  He  wanted to Jet  away
alone and think this e[Serience throuJh, but knew he could not  leave until
he was dismissed. The  old  woman had Jained  a Sower over  him.  They
spoke truth. His  mother  had underJone this  test. There must  be terrible
SurSose in it … the Sain and Iear had been terrible. He understood terrible
SurSoses. They drove aJainst all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul
Ielt that  he had been inIected with  terrible SurSose. He did not know  yet
what the terrible SurSose was.
   “Some  day, lad,”   the old  woman  said, “you,  too,  may  have to  stand
outside a door like that. It takes a measure oI doinJ.”
   Paul  looked  down  at the  hand that  had  known  Sain, then  uS to  the
Reverend Mother. The sound oI her voice had contained a diIIerence then
Irom  any  other  voice  in   his  e[Serience. The   words  were  outlined  in
brilliance. There was an edJe to them. He  Ielt that  any Tuestion he miJht
ask her would brinJ an answer that could liIt him out oI his Ilesh-world into
somethinJ Jreater.
   “Why  do you test Ior humans?” he asked.
   “To  set you Iree.”
   “Free?”
   “Once  men turned their thinkinJ  over  to machines in the hoSe that this
would set them Iree. But  that only  Sermitted other men with  machines to
enslave them.”
   “  ‘Thou  shalt  not make a machine in  the likeness oI  a man’s mind,’  ”
Paul Tuoted.
   “RiJht   out oI  the Butlerian  Jihad and the  OranJe Catholic Bible,”   she
said. “But  what the O.C. Bible  should’ve  said is: ‘Thou  shalt not make a
machine to counterIeit a human mind.’ Have you studied the Mentat in your
service?”
   “I’ve  studied with ThuIir  Hawat.”
   “The  Great Revolt took away a crutch,” she said. “It Iorced human minds
to develoS. Schools were started to train human talents.”
   “Bene Gesserit schools?”
   She nodded. “We have two chieI  survivors oI those ancient schools: the
Bene Gesserit and the SSacinJ Guild. The Guild, so we think, emShasizes
almost Sure mathematics. Bene Gesserit SerIorms another Iunction.”
   “Politics,”  he said.
   “Kull   wahad!” the old woman said. She sent a hard Jlance at Jessica.

21
   “I’ve  not told him,  Your Reverence,” Jessica said.
   The  Reverend Mother returned her attention  to Paul. “You  did  that on
remarkably  Iew  clues,”  she  said.  “Politics   indeed.  The  oriJinal   Bene
Gesserit school was directed by  those who  saw the  need oI  a thread oI
continuity  in human aIIairs.  They saw  there could be no  such continuity
without   seSaratinJ  human   stock   Irom    animal   stock—Ior    breedinJ
SurSoses.”
   The old woman’s words abruStly lost their sSecial sharSness Ior Paul. He
Ielt an oIIense aJainst what his  mother called his instinct  for  riJhtness. It
wasn’t that Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she
said. It was somethinJ deeSer, somethinJ tied to his terrible SurSose.
   He  said: “But  my  mother tells  me many  Bene Gesserit oI the  schools
don’t know their ancestry.”
   “The  Jenetic  lines are always in  our  records,” she said. “Your  mother
knows  that  either  she’s  oI   Bene  Gesserit  descent or   her  stock  was
acceStable in itselI.”
   “Then  why couldn’t she know who her Sarents are?”
   “Some do….  Many don’t.  We miJht, Ior e[amSle, have wanted to breed
her to a close relative to set uS a dominant in some Jenetic trait. We have
many reasons.”
   AJain,  Paul Ielt the oIIense aJainst riJhtness. He said: “You take a lot on
yourselves.”
   The Reverend Mother stared at him,  wonderinJ: Did  I hear criticism  in
his voice? “We carry a heavy burden,” she said.
   Paul Ielt  himselI cominJ more and more out oI the shock oI  the test. He
leveled a measurinJ stare at her, said: “You say maybe I’m the … Kwisatz
Haderach. What’s that, a human Jom Mabbar?”
   “Paul,”  Jessica said. “You mustn’t take that tone with—”
   “I’ll   handle this, Jessica,” the old woman said. “Now,  lad, do you know
about the Truthsayer druJ?”
   “You  take it  to imSrove your  ability  to detect Ialsehood,” he said. “My
mother’s told me.”
   “Have  you ever seen truthtrance?”
   He shook his head. “No.”
   “The   druJ’s   danJerous,”  she  said,  “but   it   Jives   insiJht.   When  a
Truthsayer’s JiIted by the druJ, she can look many Slaces in her memory—
in her body’s memory. We look  down so many avenues oI the Sast … but

22
only Ieminine avenues.” Her voice took on a note oI sadness. “Yet, there’s a
Slace where no Truthsayer can see. We are reSelled by it, terrorized. It is
said a man will  come one day and Iind  in  the JiIt  oI  the druJ his inward
eye. He  will  look  where  we  cannot—into both  Ieminine  and masculine
Sasts.”
   “Your  Kwisatz Haderach?”
   “Yes,  the one who can be many  Slaces at once: the Kwisatz Haderach.
Many men have tried the druJ … so many, but none has succeeded.”
   “They  tried and Iailed, all oI them?”
   “Oh,  no.” She shook her head. “They tried and died.”

23
        To attempt an understanding of Muad‘Dib without understanding his mortal enemies, the
        Harkonnens, is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood. It is the attempt to see the
        Light without knowing Darkness. It can not be.

  IT WAS A  relieI  Jlobe   oI  a world,   Sartly  in  shadows, sSinninJ   under the
imSetus oI  a Iat  hand that Jlittered   with  rinJs.  The  Jlobe  sat on a  IreeIorm
stand at  one  wall   oI  a  windowless   room  whose  other   walls  Sresented  a
Satchwork oI  multicolored   scrolls,  Iilmbooks,   taSes and reels. LiJht  Jlowed
in the room  Irom  Jolden balls  hanJinJ  in mobile  susSensor Iields.
    An  elliSsoid  desk with   a toS oI  Made-Sink SetriIied elacca wood  stood  at
the center  oI  the  room.  VeriIorm   susSensor chairs  rinJed   it,  two  oI  them
occuSied. In  one  sat a  dark-haired  youth  oI  about  si[teen   years, round  oI
Iace  and  with    sullen   eyes.  The  other   held   a  slender,  short   man   with
eIIeminate Iace.
    Both  youth   and  man  stared  at  the  Jlobe   and  the  man  halI-hidden   in
shadows sSinninJ it.
    A  chuckle  sounded beside  the  Jlobe.  A  basso voice  rumbled  out  oI  the
chuckle:  “There   it  is,  Piter—the   biJJest   mantraS  in  all   history.  And   the
Duke’s  headed into  its  Maws. Is it not a  maJniIicent   thinJ  that  I, the  Baron
Vladimir   Harkonnen, do?”
    “Assuredly,  Baron,”   said the man. His  voice came  out tenor with  a sweet,
musical Tuality.
    The Iat  hand  descended onto  the  Jlobe,  stoSSed the  sSinninJ.  Now,  all
eyes in the  room  could  Iocus on  the motionless  surIace  and see that it  was
the kind  oI Jlobe  made Ior  wealthy  collectors  or  Slanetary Jovernors  oI  the
EmSire.  It   had  the  stamS  oI  ImSerial   handicraIt    about  it.   Latitude   and
lonJitude  lines   were  laid  in  with   hair-Iine  Slatinum   wire.  The  Solar  caSs
were insets oI Iinest  cloudmilk   diamonds.
    The  Iat  hand  moved,   tracinJ   details   on  the  surIace.  “I   invite   you   to
observe,”  the  basso voice  rumbled.   “Observe  closely,  Piter,  and  you,  too,
Feyd-Rautha, my  darlinJ:  Irom  si[ty   deJrees north  to seventy deJrees south
—these e[Tuisite   riSSles.  Their  colorinJ:   does it  not  remind  you  oI  sweet
caramels? And   nowhere  do  you  see blue  oI  lakes  or  rivers   or  seas. And

24
these lovely   Solar  caSs—so small.  Could  anyone  mistake  this  Slace?
Arrakis! Truly  uniTue. A suSerb settinJ Ior a uniTue victory.”
   A  smile touched Piter’s liSs. “And to think, Baron: the Padishah EmSeror
believes he’s Jiven the Duke your sSice Slanet. How SoiJnant.”
   “That’s  a  nonsensical statement,” the Baron rumbled. “You  say this  to
conIuse younJ Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to conIuse my neShew.”
   The  sullen-Iaced youth  stirred in  his chair,  smoothed a wrinkle  in  the
black leotards he wore. He sat uSriJht as a discreet taSSinJ sounded at the
door in the wall behind him.
   Piter unIolded Irom his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enouJh
to acceSt a messaJe cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and
scanned it. A chuckle sounded Irom him. Another.
   “Well?”  the Baron demanded.
   “The  Iool answered us, Baron!”
   “Whenever  did  an Atreides  reIuse the oSSortunity Ior  a  Jesture?” the
Baron asked. “Well, what does he say?”
   “He’s  most uncouth,  Baron. Addresses you as ‘Harkonnen’-no  ‘Sire et
Cher Cousin,’ no title, nothinJ.”
   “It’s   a  Jood  name,”  the  Baron  Jrowled,  and his  voice  betrayed  his
imSatience. “What does dear Leto say?”
   “He  says: ‘Your  oIIer oI  a meetinJ is reIused. I have oIttimes  met your
treachery and this all men know.’ ”
   “And?”  the Baron asked.
   “He  says: ‘The art oI kanly still  has admirers in the EmSire.’ He siJns it:
‘Duke Leto oI  Arrakis.’  ”  Piter beJan to lauJh. “OI  Arrakis!  Oh, my! This
is almost too rich!”
   “Be  silent, Piter,” the Baron said, and the lauJhter stoSSed as thouJh shut
oII with  a switch. “Kanly,  is it?”  the Baron asked. “Vendetta, heh? And he
uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it.”
   “You  made the Seace Jesture,” Piter said. “The Iorms have been obeyed.”
   “For  a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,” the Baron said. And he thouJht:
I must do away with that  one soon. He has almost outlived his useIulness.
The Baron stared across the room at his Mentat assassin, seeinJ the Ieature
about him that most SeoSle noticed Iirst: the eyes, the shaded slits oI blue
within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.
   A  Jrin  Ilashed across Piter’s Iace. It  was like  a  mask Jrimace beneath
those eyes like holes. “But, Baron! Never has revenJe been more beautiIul.

25
It is  to see a Slan oI the most e[Tuisite  treachery: to make Leto e[chanJe
Caladan Ior Dune—and without alternative because the EmSeror orders it.
How waJJish oI you!”
   In  a cold voice, the Baron said: “You have a Ilu[ oI the mouth, Piter.”
   “But   I   am haSSy, my  Baron.  Whereas you   …  you  are  touched by
Mealousy.”
   “Piter!”
   “Ah-ah,   Baron!  Is  it  not  reJrettable  you  were  unable to  devise  this
delicious scheme by yourselI?”
   “Someday I will  have you stranJled, Piter.”
   “OI  a certainty, Baron. EnIin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?”
   “Have  you been chewinJ verite or semuta, Piter?”
   “Truth  without  Iear surSrises the Baron,” Piter said. His Iace drew down
into a caricature oI a IrowninJ mask. “Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know
as a Mentat when you will send the e[ecutioner. You will hold  back Must so
lonJ as I am useIul. To move sooner would be wasteIul and I’m yet oI much
use. I know what it is you learned Irom that lovely Dune Slanet—waste not.
True, Baron?”
   The Baron continued to stare at Piter.
   Feyd-Rautha sTuirmed in  his chair. These wrangling  fools! he thought.
My uncle  cannot talk  to  his Mentat  without  arguing. Do  they  think I’ve
nothing to do except listen to their arguments?
   “Feyd,”  the Baron said. “I told  you to listen and learn when I invited you
in here. Are you learninJ?”
   “Yes, Uncle.”  the voice was careIully subservient.
   “Sometimes I  wonder about Piter,” the  Baron said. “I  cause Sain out oI
necessity, but he … I swear he takes a Sositive deliJht in it.  For myselI,  I
can Ieel Sity toward the Soor Duke Leto.  Dr. Yueh will  move aJainst him
soon, and that’ll be the end oI  all the Atreides. But  surely Leto will   know
whose hand directed the Sliant doctor … and knowinJ that will be a terrible
thinJ.”
   “Then  why haven’t you  directed the doctor to sliS a kindMal between his
ribs Tuietly and eIIiciently?” Piter asked. “You talk oI Sity, but—”
   “The  Duke  must know  when I  encomSass his doom,” the  Baron said.
“And  the other  Great Houses must learn oI  it.  The knowledJe  will   Jive
them Sause. I’ll   Jain   a bit   more  room  to  maneuver. The  necessity is
obvious, but I don’t have to like it.”

26
   “Room  to  maneuver,” Piter sneered. “Already  you have the  EmSeror’s
eyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the EmSeror will send a
leJion or two oI his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that’ll be an
end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.”
   “You’d   like to  see that, wouldn’t  you, Piter?”  the Baron asked. “You’d
enMoy seeinJ the CorSs oI Sardaukar SillaJe throuJh my cities and sack this
castle. You’d truly enMoy that.”
   “Does the Baron need to ask?” Piter whisSered.
   “You  should’ve been a Bashar oI the CorSs,” the Baron said. “You’re too
interested in blood and Sain. PerhaSs I was too Tuick with my  Sromise oI
the sSoils oI Arrakis.”
   Piter  took Iive  curiously  mincinJ  steSs into the room,  stoSSed directly
behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tiJht air oI tension in  the room, and the
youth looked uS at Piter with a worried Irown.
   “Do  not  toy with  Piter, Baron,”  Piter said. “You  Sromised me the Lady
Jessica. You Sromised her to me.”
   “For  what, Piter?” the Baron asked. “For Sain?”
   Piter stared at him, draJJinJ out the silence.
   Feyd-Rautha moved his susSensor chair to one side, said: “Uncle,  do I
have to stay? You said you’d—”
   “My   darlinJ  Feyd-Rautha Jrows imSatient,” the Baron  said. He moved
within  the shadows beside the Jlobe. “Patience, Feyd.” And he turned his
attention back to  the Mentat. “What  oI  the DukelinJ,   the child  Paul, my
dear Piter?”
   “The  traS will brinJ him to you, Baron,”  Piter muttered.
   “That’s   not  my   Tuestion,”  the  Baron  said.  “You’ll    recall   that  you
Sredicted the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a dauJhter to the Duke. You
were wronJ, eh, Mentat?”
   “I’m   not oIten wronJ, Baron,”  Piter said, and Ior the Iirst time there was
Iear in  his  voice.  “Give  me  that: I’m   not  oIten wronJ.   And  you know
yourselI these Bene Gesserit bear mostly  dauJhters. Even the EmSeror’s
consort had Sroduced only Iemales.”
   “Uncle,”   said Feyd-Rautha, “you  said  there’d be  somethinJ imSortant
here Ior me to—”
   “Listen  to  my neShew,” the Baron said. “He asSires to rule my Barony,
yet he cannot rule himselI.”  The Baron stirred beside the Jlobe, a shadow
amonJ shadows. “Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonne, I summoned you here

27
hoSinJ to teach you a bit oI wisdom. Have you observed our Jood Mentat?
You should’ve learned somethinJ Irom this e[chanJe.”
   “But,  Uncle—”
   “A  most eIIicient Mentat, Piter, wouldn’t you say, Feyd?”
   “Yes, but—”
   “Ah!   Indeed but!  But  he consumes too much sSice, eats it like  candy.
Look at his eyes! He miJht’ve come directly Irom  the Arrakeen labor Sool.
EIIicient,  Piter, but he’s still  emotional and Srone to Sassionate outbursts.
EIIicient, Piter, but he still can err.”
   Piter sSoke in a low, sullen tone: “Did  you  call me in here to imSair my
eIIiciency with criticism,  Baron?”
   “ImSair  your eIIiciency?  You know me better, Piter. I  wish only  Ior my
neShew to understand the limitations oI a Mentat.”
   “Are  you already traininJ my reSlacement?” Piter demanded.
   “ReSlace you? Why, Piter, where could I  Iind another Mentat with  your
cunninJ and venom?”
   “The  same Slace you Iound me, Baron.”
   “PerhaSs I should at that,” the Baron mused. “You do seem a bit unstable
lately. And the sSice you eat!”
   “Are  my Sleasures too e[Sensive, Baron? Do you obMect to them?”
   “My   dear Piter,  your  Sleasures are what tie you  to  me. How  could  I
obMect to that? I merely wish my neShew to observe this about you.”
   “Then  I’m  on  disSlay,” Piter  said. “Shall  I dance? Shall I  SerIorm my
various Iunctions Ior the eminent Feyd-Rau—”
   “Precisely,”  the  Baron said. “You   are on disSlay. Now,  be silent.”  He
Jlanced at Feyd-Rautha, notinJ his neShew’s liSs, the Iull and SoutinJ look
oI them, the Harkonnen Jenetic marker, now twisted sliJhtly in amusement.
“This  is a  Mentat, Feyd. It  has been trained  and conditioned to  SerIorm
certain duties. The Iact that  it’s encased in a human body, however, must
not be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients
with their thinkinJ  machines had the riJht idea.”
   “They  were toys comSared to me,” Piter snarled. “You  yourselI, Baron,
could outSerIorm those machines.”
   “PerhaSs,” the Baron said. “Ah, well….”  He took a deeS breath, belched.
“Now,  Piter, outline  Ior my  neShew the salient Ieatures oI  our camSaiJn
aJainst the House oI Atreides. Function as a Mentat Ior us, iI you Slease.”

28
   “Baron,  I’ve warned you not to trust one so younJ with this  inIormation.
My observations oI—”
   “I’ll   be the MudJe oI this,” the Baron said. “I  Jive you an order, Mentat.
PerIorm one oI your various Iunctions.”
   “So   be it,”   Piter  said. He  straiJhtened,  assuminJ an  odd attitude  oI
diJnity—as thouJh  it were another mask, but this  time clothinJ  his entire
body. “In a Iew  days Standard, the entire household oI the Duke Leto will
embark on a SSacinJ Guild liner Ior Arrakis. The Guild will deSosit them at
the city oI Arrakeen rather than at our city oI  CarthaJ. The Duke’s Mentat,
ThuIir  Hawat,   will   have  concluded riJhtly   that  Arrakeen  is   easier to
deIend.”
   “Listen  careIully, Feyd,” the Baron said. “Observe the Slans within Slans
within Slans.”
   Feyd-Rautha nodded, thinkinJ:  This is  more like it.  The old  monster is
letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his
heir.
   “There  are several  tanJential Sossibilities,”  Piter  said. “I  indicate  that
House Atreides  will   Jo  to  Arrakis.  We  must  not,  however, iJnore  the
Sossibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a Slace
oI saIety  outside the System. Others  in like   circumstances have become
reneJade Houses, takinJ Iamily atomics and shields and IleeinJ beyond the
ImSerium.”
   “The  Duke’s too Sroud a man Ior that,” the Baron said.
   “It   is a Sossibility,”  Piter said. “The ultimate  eIIect Ior  us would be the
same, however.”
   “No,  it  would  not!”  the Baron Jrowled.  “I  must have him dead and his
line ended.”
   “That’s  the hiJh  Srobability,” Piter  said. “There are certain SreSarations
that indicate  when a House  is JoinJ  reneJade. The  Duke aSSears to be
doinJ none oI these thinJs.”
   “So,”  the Baron siJhed. “Get on with it, Piter.
   “At   Arrakeen,”  Piter  said, “the  Duke  and his  Iamily   will   occuSy the
Residency, lately the home oI Count and Lady FenrinJ.”
   “The  Ambassador to the SmuJJlers,” the Baron chuckled.
   “Ambassador to what?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
   “Your   uncle   makes  a  Moke,” Piter  said.   “He   calls  Count   FenrinJ
Ambassador to   the   SmuJJlers,  indicatinJ   the   EmSeror’s  interest   in

29
smuJJlinJ oSerations on Arrakis.”
   Feyd-Rautha turned a Suzzled stare on his uncle. “Why?”
   “Don’t   be  dense, Feyd,”  the  Baron  snaSSed. “As lonJ   as the  Guild
remains eIIectively  outside ImSerial control,  how  could  it  be otherwise?
How else could sSies and assassins move about?”
   Feyd-Rautha’s mouth made a soundless “Oh-h-h-h.”
   “We’ve  arranJed diversions at the Residency,” Piter said. “There’ll be an
attemSt on the liIe oI the Atreides heir—an attemSt which could succeed.”
   “Piter,”  the Baron rumbled, “you indicated—”
   “I   indicated accidents can haSSen,” Piter said. “And   the attemSt must
aSSear valid.”
   “Ah,   but  the lad  has such a sweet younJ  body,”  the  Baron said. “OI
course, he’s Sotentially more danJerous than the Iather … with that witch
mother traininJ him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, Slease continue, Piter.”
   “Hawat  will  have divined  that we have an aJent Slanted on him,”  Piter
said. “The obvious susSect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our aJent. But Hawat
has investiJated and Iound that our doctor  is a Suk  School Jraduate with
ImSerial ConditioninJ—suSSosedly saIe enouJh  to  minister  even to  the
EmSeror. Great store is  set on  ImSerial  ConditioninJ.  It’s  assumed that
ultimate  conditioninJ   cannot  be  removed  without   killinJ   the   subMect.
However, as someone once observed, Jiven the riJht lever you can move a
Slanet. We Iound the lever that moved the doctor.”
   “How?”    Feyd-Rautha  asked.  He   Iound  this   a  IascinatinJ   subMect.
Everyone knew you couldn’t subvert ImSerial ConditioninJ!
   “Another  time,” the Baron said. “Continue, Piter.”
   “In   Slace oI  Yueh,” Piter  said, “we’ll   draJ  a most  interestinJ  susSect
across Hawat’s Sath. The very audacity oI this susSect will recommend her
to Hawat’s attention.”
   “Her?”  Feyd-Rautha asked.
   “The  Lady Jessica herselI,” the Baron said.
   “Is  it not sublime?” Piter asked. “Hawat’s mind will  be so Iilled with  this
SrosSect it’ll imSair his Iunction as a Mentat. He may even try to kill  her.”
Piter Irowned, then: “But I don’t think he’ll  be able to carry it oII.”
   “You  don’t want him to, eh?” the Baron asked.
   “Don’t   distract me,” Piter said. “While  Hawat’s occuSied with  the Lady
Jessica, we’ll divert him Iurther with  uSrisinJs in a Iew Jarrison towns and
the like.  These will  be Sut down.  The Duke  must believe he’s JaininJ  a

30
measure oI security. Then, when the moment is riSe, we’ll siJnal Yueh and
move in with our maMor Iorce … ah….”
   “Go  ahead, tell him all oI it,” the Baron said.
   “We’ll   move in  strenJthened by two  leJions oI  Sardaukar disJuised in
Harkonnen livery.”
   “Sardaukar!”   Feyd-Rautha breathed. His  mind   Iocused on  the  dread
ImSerial  trooSs, the  killers   without   mercy,  the  soldier-Ianatics  oI  the
Padishah EmSeror.
   “You  see how I  trust you, Feyd,”  the Baron said. “No  hint oI  this must
ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad miJht unite aJainst the
ImSerial House and there’d be chaos.”
   “The  main  Soint,” Piter  said, “is  this: since House Harkonnen is  beinJ
used to do the ImSerial  dirty work,  we’ve  Jained a true  advantaJe. It’s a
danJerous advantaJe, to be sure, but iI used cautiously, will   brinJ House
Harkonnen Jreater wealth than that oI any other House in the ImSerium.”
   “You  have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,” the Baron said.
“Not  in   your  wildest  imaJininJs.   To beJin,  we’ll    have an  irrevocable
directorshiS in the CHOAM ComSany.”
   Feyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth  was the thinJ.   CHOAM  was  the key  to
wealth, each noble House diSSinJ Irom the comSany’s coIIers whatever it
could under the Sower oI the directorshiSs. Those CHOAM directorshiSs—
they were the real evidence oI Solitical Sower in the ImSerium, SassinJ with
the shiIts  oI  votinJ   strenJth within   the  Landsraad as it  balanced itselI
aJainst the EmSeror and his suSSorters.
   “The  Duke  Leto,”  Piter said, “may  attemSt to  Ilee to  the new  Fremen
scum alonJ the desert’s edJe. Or he  may try  to send his  Iamily  into that
imaJined security. But that Sath is blocked by one oI His  MaMesty’s aJents
—the Slanetary ecoloJist. You may remember him—Kynes.”
   “Feyd  remembers him,” the Baron said. “Get on with it.”
   “You  do not drool very Srettily, Baron,” Piter said.
   “Get  on with it, I command you!” the Baron roared.
   Piter  shruJJed. “II  matters Jo as Slanned,” he said, “House  Harkonnen
will  have a subIieI on Arrakis within  a Standard year. Your uncle will have
disSensation oI that IieI. His own Sersonal aJent will rule on Arrakis.”
   “More  SroIits,” Feyd-Rautha said.
   “Indeed,”  the Baron said. And  he thouJht: It’s only  just. We’re the ones
who tamed Arrakis  …  except for  the few mongrel  Fremen hiding  in  the

31
skirts of the desert … and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost
as tightly as the native laborpool.
   “And   the  Great Houses will   know  that  the  Baron  has destroyed the
Atreides,” Piter said. “They will know.”
   “They  will  know,” the Baron breathed.
   “Loveliest  oI all,”  Piter said, “is  that the Duke will  know, too. He knows
now. He can already Ieel the traS.”
   “It’s  true the Duke  knows,” the Baron said, and his voice held a note oI
sadness. “He could not helS but know … more’s the Sity.”
   The  Baron  moved  out  and  away Irom   the Jlobe   oI  Arrakis.  As  he
emerJed Irom  the shadows, his  IiJure  took  on  dimension—Jrossly  and
immensely Iat. And  with  subtle bulJes beneath Iolds oI  his dark robes to
reveal that all this Iat was sustained Sartly by Sortable susSensors harnessed
to his Ilesh. He miJht weiJh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his
Ieet would carry no more than IiIty oI them.
   “I  am hunJry,” the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his SrotrudinJ liSs with
a berinJed hand, stared down  at Feyd-Rautha throuJh  Iat-enIolded eyes.
“Send Ior Iood, my darlinJ. We will eat beIore we retire.”

32
        Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: “The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of
        acourtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in
        tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she
        will  find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a well-spring of
        cunning and resourcefulness.”
                                             —from“Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries” by the Princess Irulan



 
  “WELL,  JESSICA,    what  have  you  to  say Ior   yourselI?”    asked the  Reverend
Mother.
    It  was  near  sunset  at Castle  Caladan   on  the day  oI  Paul’s   ordeal.  The  two
women   were   alone   in   Jessica’s   morninJ    room    while    Paul   waited   in   the
adMoininJ soundSrooIed    Meditation    Chamber.
    Jessica  stood  IacinJ   the  south   windows.    She saw  and  yet  did   not  see the
eveninJ’s   banked  colors   across meadow   and  river.  She  heard  and yet  did  not
hear the  Reverend   Mother’s   Tuestion.
    There   had  been  another  ordeal   once—so    many  years   aJo.  A  skinny    Jirl
with  hair  the  color   oI bronze,   her  body  tortured   by  the winds   oI  Suberty,  had
entered  the   study   oI  the   Reverend   Mother    Gaius   Helen   Mohiam,    Proctor
SuSerior  oI  the  Bene  Gesserit  school   on Wallach   IX.   Jessica looked   down   at
her  riJht    hand,   Ile[ed    the   IinJers,    rememberinJ     the  Sain,   the   terror,   the
anJer.
    “Poor   Paul,”   she whisSered.
    “I   asked  you  a Tuestion,   Jessica!”    The  old  woman’s    voice  was  snaSSish,
demandinJ.
    “What?    Oh….”    Jessica  tore  her  attention    away   Irom   the  Sast,  Iaced  the
Reverend  Mother,   who   sat with   back  to the  stone  wall   between  the  two  west
windows.   “What   do  you  want  me  to  say?”
    “What   do  I  want   you  to  say? What   do  I  want  you  to  say?”   The  old  voice
carried  a tone  oI  cruel  mimicry.
    “So  I  had  a son!”  Jessica  Ilared.   And  she  knew  she was  beinJ   Joaded  into
this  anJer  deliberately.
    “You   were  told  to  bear only   dauJhters   to the  Atreides.”
    “It   meant  so much  to  him,”   Jessica  Sleaded.
    “And     you    in    your    Sride    thouJht     you    could    Sroduce    the    Kwisatz
Haderach!”

33
   Jessica liIted her chin. “I sensed the Sossibility.”
   “You   thouJht only  oI  your  Duke’s  desire Ior  a  son,”  the old  woman
snaSSed. “And  his  desires don’t   IiJure  in   this.  An  Atreides   dauJhter
could’ve  been wed to  a  Harkonnen heir  and sealed the  breach. You’ve
hoSelessly comSlicated matters. We may lose both bloodlines now.”
   “You’re  not inIallible,”   Jessica said. She braved the steady stare Irom the
old eyes.
   Presently, the old woman muttered: “What’s done is done.”
   “I  vowed never to reJret my decision,” Jessica said.
   “How   noble,” the  Reverend Mother sneered. “No reJrets. We shall see
when you’re  a IuJitive  with  a  Srice on your  head and every man’s hand
turned aJainst you to seek your liIe and the liIe oI your son.”
   Jessica Saled. “Is there no alternative?”
   “Alternative?  A Bene Gesserit should ask that?”
   “I  ask only what you see in the Iuture with your suSerior abilities.”
   “I  see in the Iuture what I’ve seen in the Sast. You well know the Sattern
oI  our   aIIairs,  Jessica. The  race  knows   its  own   mortality   and  Iears
staJnation oI  its  heredity.  It’s  in   the  bloodstream—the urJe  to  minJle
Jenetic strains without Slan. The ImSerium, the CHOAM ComSany, all the
Great Houses, they are but bits oI Ilotsam in the Sath oI the Ilood.”
   “CHOAM,”   Jessica muttered. “I suSSose it’s already decided how they’ll
redivide the sSoils oI Arrakis.”
   “What  is  CHOAM  but the  weather vane oI our times,”  the old  woman
said. “The EmSeror and his Iriends now command IiIty-nine  Soint si[-Iive
Ser cent oI the CHOAM  directorshiS’s votes. Certainly they smell  SroIits,
and likely   as  others smell  those  same SroIits  his  votinJ   strenJth will
increase. This is the Sattern oI history, Jirl.”
   “That’s   certainly  what I  need  riJht  now,”  Jessica said. “A   review  oI
history.”
   “Don’t  be Iacetious, Jirl!  You know as well as I do what Iorces surround
us. We’ve   a  three-Soint civilization:   the  ImSerial   Household balanced
aJainst the Federated Great Houses oI the Landsraad, and between them,
the Guild with  its damnable monoSoly on interstellar transSort. In Solitics,
the triSod is the most unstable oI all structures. It’d be bad enouJh without
the comSlication oI  a  Ieudal trade culture  which  turns its  back on  most
science.”

34
   Jessica sSoke bitterly: “ChiSs in the Sath oI the Ilood—and this chiS here,
this is the Duke Leto, and this one’s his son, and this one’s—”
   “Oh,  shut uS, Jirl.  You entered this with  Iull  knowledJe oI  the delicate
edJe you walked.”
   “  ‘I  am Bene Gesserit: I e[ist only to serve,’ ” Jessica Tuoted.
   “Truth,”  the old woman said. “And  all we can hoSe Ior now is to Srevent
this Irom eruStinJ into Jeneral conIlaJration, to salvaJe what we can oI the
key bloodlines.”
   Jessica closed her  eyes, IeelinJ  tears Sress out  beneath the lids.  She
IouJht down the inner tremblinJ, the outer tremblinJ, the uneven breathinJ,
the raJJed Sulse, the sweatinJ oI the Salms. Presently, she said, “I’ll Say Ior
my own mistake.”
   “And  your son will  Say with you.”
   “I’ll   shield him as well as I’m able.”
   “Shield!”   the old woman snaSSed. “You well know the weakness there!
Shield your  son too much,  Jessica, and he’ll  not Jrow  stronJ  enouJh to
IulIill  any destiny.”
   Jessica turned away, looked out the window at the JatherinJ darkness. “Is
it really that terrible, this Slanet oI Arrakis?”
   “Bad  enouJh, but  not  all  bad. The Missionaria  Protectiva has been in
there and soItened it uS somewhat.” The Reverend Mother heaved herselI
to her Ieet, straiJhtened a Iold in her Jown. “Call the boy in here. I must be
leavinJ soon.”
   “Must  you?”
   The  old woman’s voice  soItened. “Jessica, Jirl, I  wish I  could  stand in
your Slace and take your  suIIerinJs. But  each oI  us must make her  own
Sath.”
   “I  know.”
   “You’re  as dear to me as any oI my own dauJhters, but I cannot let that
interIere with duty.”
   “I  understand … the necessity.”
   “What  you did, Jessica, and why you did it—we both know. But kindness
Iorces me to tell you there’s little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit
Totality. You mustn’t let yourselI hoSe too much.”
   Jessica shook tears Irom the corners oI her eyes. It was an anJry Jesture.
“You make me  Ieel like  a little  Jirl  aJain—recitinJ  my  Iirst  lesson.” She

35
Iorced the words out:  “ ‘Humans  must never submit to  animals.’ ”  A  dry
sob shook her. In a low voice, she said: “I’ve been so lonely.”
   “It  should be one oI the tests,” the old woman said. “Humans are almost
always lonely. Now summon the boy. He’s had a lonJ, IriJhteninJ day. But
he’s had time to  think  and remember, and I must ask the other  Tuestions
about these dreams oI his.”
   Jessica nodded, went to the door oI the Meditation  Chamber, oSened it.
“Paul, come in now, Slease.”
   Paul  emerJed with   a stubborn  slowness. He  stared at  his mother  as
thouJh she were a stranJer. Wariness veiled his eyes when he Jlanced at the
Reverend Mother, but  this time  he nodded to  her, the  nod one Jives  an
eTual. He heard his mother close the door behind him.
   “YounJ  man,” the old woman said, “let’s return to this dream business.”
   “What  do you want?”
   “Do  you dream every niJht?”
   “Not  dreams worth rememberinJ. I can remember every dream, but some
are worth rememberinJ and some aren’t.”
   “How  do you know the diIIerence?”
   “I  Must know it.”
   The  old woman Jlanced at Jessica, back to Paul. “What  did you  dream
last niJht? Was it worth rememberinJ?”
   “Yes.”  Paul closed his eyes. “I dreamed a cavern … and water … and a
Jirl  there—very skinny with  biJ  eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no  whites in
them. I talk to her and tell her about you, about seeinJ the Reverend Mother
on Caladan.” Paul oSened his eyes.
   “And  the  thinJ you  tell this  stranJe Jirl about seeinJ me, did  it haSSen
today?”
   Paul  thouJht about this,  then: “Yes. I  tell  the Jirl   you came and Sut a
stamS oI stranJeness on me.”
   “StamS oI  stranJeness,” the old woman breathed, and aJain she shot a
Jlance at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. “Tell me truly  now, Paul,
do you oIten  have dreams oI thinJs that haSSen aIterward e[actly as you
dreamed them?”
   “Yes. And I’ve  dreamed about that Jirl beIore.”
   “Oh? You know her?”
   “I  will  know her.”
   “Tell  me about her.”

36
   AJain,  Paul closed his eyes. “We’re in a little Slace in some rocks where
it’s sheltered. It’s almost niJht, but it’s hot and I can see Satches oI sand out
oI an oSeninJ in the rocks. We’re… waitinJ Ior  somethinJ … Ior  me to Jo
meet some SeoSle. And she’s IriJhtened but tryinJ to hide it Irom me, and
I’m  e[cited. And  she says: ‘Tell me  about the waters oI your homeworld,
Usul.’  ”   Paul  oSened his  eyes.  “Isn’t   that  stranJe?  My   homeworld’s
Caladan. I’ve never even heard oI a Slanet called Usul.”
   “Is  there more to this dream?” Jessica SromSted.
   “Yes. But  maybe she was callinJ me Usul,” Paul said. “I  Must thouJht oI
that.” AJain,  he closed his eyes. “She asks me to tell her about the waters.
And I take her hand. And I say I’ll  tell her a Soem. And I tell her the Soem,
but I have to e[Slain some oI the words—like  beach and surI and seaweed
and seaJulls.”
   “What  Soem?” the Reverend Mother asked.
   Paul oSened his eyes. “It’s Must one oI Gurney Halleck’s tone Soems Ior
sad times.”
   Behind Paul, Jessica beJan to recite:

       “I  remember salt smoke Irom a beach Iire 
       And shadows under the Sines— 
       Solid, clean … Ii[ed— 
       SeaJulls Serched at the tiS oI land, 
       White uSon Jreen …                      
       And a wind comes throuJh the Sines  
       To sway the shadows;                       
       The seaJulls sSread their winJs,  
       LiIt                                               
       And Iill  the sky with screeches. 
       And I  hear the wind                   
       BlowinJ  across our beach,  
       And the surI,                       
       And I  see that our Iire 
       Has scorched the seaweed.” 

 
   “That’s  the one,” Paul said.

37
   The  old woman  stared at Paul, then: “YounJ  man,  as a Proctor oI  the
Bene Gesserit, I   seek the  Kwisatz   Haderach, the  male who   truly  can
become one oI us. Your  mother sees this Sossibility in  you, but  she sees
with the eyes oI a mother. Possibility I see, too, but no more.”
   She Iell  silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to sSeak. He waited her
out.
   Presently, she said: “As  you  will,  then. You’ve  deSths in you;  that I’ll
Jrant.”
   “May  I Jo now?”  he asked.
   “Don’t  you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the
Kwisatz Haderach?” Jessica asked.
   “She said those who tried Ior it died.”
   “But  I  can helS you with  a Iew hints at  why they Iailed,”  the Reverend
Mother said.
   She talks of hints,  Paul thought. She doesn’t really know anything. And
he said: “Hint then.”
   “And  be  damned to me?” She smiled wryly,  a crisscross oI wrinkles in
the old Iace. “Very well: ‘That which submits rules.’ ”
   He  Ielt  astonishment: she was talkinJ about such elementary thinJs  as
tension within meaninJ. Did she think his mother had tauJht him nothinJ at
all?
   “That’s  a hint?” he asked.
   “We’re  not here to bandy words or Tuibble over their  meaninJ,” the old
woman said. “The willow  submits to the wind and SrosSers until one day it
is many willows—a wall aJainst the wind. This is the willow’s SurSose.”
   Paul  stared at her. She said purpose  and he Ielt  the  word buIIet  him,
reinIectinJ him with terrible SurSose. He e[Serienced a sudden anJer at her:
Iatuous old witch with her mouth Iull oI Slatitudes.
   “You  think  I could be this  Kwisatz Haderach,” he said. “You  talk about
me, but you haven’t said one thinJ about what we can do to helS my Iather.
I’ve  heard you talkinJ  to my  mother. You talk  as thouJh my  Iather were
dead. Well, he isn’t!”
   “II   there were a thinJ  to  be done Ior him,  we’d  have done it,”  the old
woman Jrowled. “We  may be able to salvaJe you. DoubtIul,  but Sossible.
But Ior your  Iather, nothinJ. When you’ve  learned to acceSt that as a Iact,
you’ve learned a real Bene Gesserit lesson.”

38
   Paul saw how the words shook his mother. He Jlared at the old  woman.
How could she say such a thinJ about his Iather? What made her so sure?
His mind seethed with resentment.
   The Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. “You’ve been traininJ him in the
Way—I’ve seen the siJns oI  it. I’d  have done the same in your shoes and
devil take the Rules.”
   Jessica nodded.
   “Now,  I caution you,” said the old woman, “to iJnore the reJular order oI
traininJ. His own saIety reTuires the Voice. He already has a Jood start in it,
but we both know how  much more he needs … and that desSerately.” She
steSSed close to Paul, stared down at him. “Goodbye, younJ human. I hoSe
you make it. But iI you don’t—well,  we shall yet succeed.”
   Once more she looked at Jessica. A Ilicker siJn oI understandinJ Sassed
between them. Then the old woman sweSt Irom the room, her robes hissinJ,
with not another backward Jlance. The room and its occuSants already were
shut Irom her thouJhts.
   But  Jessica had cauJht one JlimSse oI the Reverend Mother’s Iace as she
turned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were
more unnervinJ than any other word or siJn that had Sassed between them
this day.

        You h ave read that Muad‘Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers were
        too great. But Muad’Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney Halleck,
        the trou-badour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney’s songs as you read along in this book.
        There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even into the
        heart of the Padishah Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr.
        Wellington Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who
        guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and—ofcourse—theDuke Leto, whose Tualities as a
        father have long been overlooked.
                                                 —from“A Child’s History of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
  
  THUFIR  HAWAT    sliSSed  into   the  traininJ   room   oI  Castle   Caladan,   closed
the door   soItly.   He  stood   there  a  moment,   IeelinJ   old   and  tired   and  storm-
leathered.  His  leIt   leJ  ached where   it  had been  slashed  once  in the  service  oI
the Old  Duke.
    Three  generations    of them  now,  he thouJht.
    He   stared   across  the   biJ   room    briJht    with    the  liJht    oI   noon   SourinJ
throuJh   the  skyliJhts,    saw   the  boy  seated  with   back   to  the  door,   intent   on
SaSers and charts  sSread  across an  ell  table.
    How   many  times  must  I  tell   that  lad  never   to  settle  himself   with   his  back
to a door?   Hawat   cleared  his  throat.
    Paul  remained   bent  over  his studies.
    A   cloud   shadow    Sassed  over   the   skyliJhts.    AJain,     Hawat   cleared    his
throat.
    Paul   straiJhtened,    sSoke  without    turninJ:    “I   know.   I’m    sittinJ    with   my
back  to a door.”
    Hawat   suSSressed a smile,   strode  across  the room.
    Paul  looked    uS  at  the  Jrizzled    old  man   who   stoSSed  at  a corner   oI   the
table.   Hawat’s    eyes   were   two    Sools   oI   alertness   in   a   dark   and   deeSly
seamed Iace.
    “I   heard  you   cominJ   down   the  hall,”    Paul  said.   “And    I  heard  you  oSen
the door.”
    “The   sounds  I make  could   be imitated.”
    “I’d   know   the  diIIerence.”
    He  might   at  that,  Hawat    thought.   That  witch-mother     of  his  is  giving   him
the  deep  training,     certainly.    I  wonder    what   her  precious    school   thinks   of

40
that? Maybe that’s  why they sent the  old Proctor  here—towhip our  dear
Lady Jessica into line.
   Hawat Sulled uS a chair across Irom Paul, sat down IacinJ the door. He
did it Sointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd
Slace suddenly, a stranJer-Slace with most oI its hardware already Jone oII
to Arrakis. A  traininJ  table remained, and a IencinJ mirror with  its crystal
Srisms Tuiescent, the tarJet dummy beside it Satched and Sadded, lookinJ
like an ancient Ioot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.
   There stand I, Hawat thouJht.
   “ThuIir,  what’re you thinkinJ?”  Paul asked.
   Hawat  looked at the boy. “I   was thinkinJ  we’ll  all  be out oI  here soon
and likely never see the Slace aJain.”
   “Does that make you sad?”
   “Sad?  Nonsense! PartinJ with  Iriends  is  a sadness. A Slace is  only  a
Slace.” He Jlanced at the charts on the table. “And  Arrakis is Must another
Slace.”
   “Did  my Iather send you uS to test me?”
   Hawat   scowled—the boy   had  such  observinJ  ways  about  him.  He
nodded. “You’re thinkinJ  it’d have been nicer iI he’d come uS himselI, but
you must know how busy he is. He’ll be alonJ later.”
   “I’ve  been studyinJ about the storms on Arrakis.”
   “The  storms. I see.”
   “They  sound Sretty bad.”
   “That’s  too  cautious a word:  bad. Those storms build  uS across si[  or
seven thousand kilometers oI Ilatlands, Ieed on anythinJ that can Jive them
a Sush—coriolis Iorce, other storms, anythinJ that has an ounce oI enerJy
in it.  They can blow uS to  seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with
everythinJ loose that’s in  their way—sand, dust, everythinJ. They  can eat
Ilesh oII bones and etch the bones to slivers.”
   “Why  don’t they have weather control?”
   “Arrakis    has  sSecial  Sroblems,  costs   are  hiJher,   and  there’d   be
maintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadIul hiJh Srice Ior satellite
control and your  Iather’s  House isn’t  one oI  the biJ  rich  ones, lad. You
know that.”
   “Have  you ever seen the Fremen?”
   The lad’s mind is darting all over today, Hawat thouJht.

41
   “Like   as not I have seen them,” he said. “There’s little to tell  them Irom
the Iolk  oI the  Jraben and sink. They all  wear those Jreat IlowinJ   robes.
And they  stink to  heaven in  any closed sSace. It’s Irom  those suits they
wear—call them ‘stulsuits’—that reclaim the body’s own water.”
   Paul   swallowed,   suddenly  aware   oI   the  moisture   in   his   mouth,
rememberinJ a dream oI thirst.  That SeoSle could want so Ior  water they
had to recycle their body moisture struck him  with a IeelinJ  oI desolation.
“Water’s Srecious there,” he said.
   Hawat nodded, thinkinJ:  Perhaps I’m doing it,  getting across to him the
importance of this planet as an enemy. It’s madness to go in there without
that caution in our minds.
   Paul looked uS at the skyliJht, aware that it had beJun to rain. He saw the
sSreadinJ wetness on the Jray meta-Jlass. “Water,” he said.
   “You’ll   learn a Jreat concern Ior water,” Hawat said. “As the Duke’s son
you’ll  never want  Ior  it,  but you’ll   see the Sressures oI thirst all  around
you.”
   Paul wet  his liSs with  his tonJue, thinkinJ   back to the day a week  aJo
and the ordeal  with  the Reverend Mother.  She, too, had  said somethinJ
about water starvation.
   “You’ll   learn about the Iuneral Slains,” she’d said, “about the wilderness
that is emSty, the wasteland where nothinJ lives  e[ceSt the sSice and the
sandworms. You’ll stain your  eyeSits to reduce the sun Jlare. Shelter will
mean a hollow out oI the wind and hidden Irom view. You’ll ride uSon your
own two Ieet without ‘thoSter or Jroundcar or mount.”
   And  Paul had been cauJht more by her tone—sinJsonJ and waverinJ—
than by her words.
   “When  you live  uSon Arrakis,”  she had said, “khala, the land is  emSty.
The moons will be your Iriends, the sun your enemy.”
   Paul  had sensed his mother come  uS beside him  away Irom  her  Sost
JuardinJ the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: “Do
you see no hoSe, Your Reverence?”
   “Not  Ior  the Iather.”  And the  old woman had waved Jessica to silence,
looked  down  at  Paul.  “Grave  this  on  your   memory, lad:  A   world   is
suSSorted by Iour thinJs….” She held uS Iour biJ-knuckled IinJers. “… the
learninJ oI the wise, the Mustice oI the Jreat, the Srayers oI the riJhteous and
the valor oI  the brave. But  all oI  these are as nothinJ….”  She closed her

42
IinJers into  a Iist. “…  without  a ruler  who knows the  art oI rulinJ.  Make
that the science oI your tradition!”
   A  week had Sassed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words
were only  now  beJinninJ  to come  into Iull   reJister. Now,  sittinJ  in  the
traininJ room with  ThuIir  Hawat, Paul Ielt a sharS SanJ oI Iear. He looked
across at the Mentat’s Suzzled Irown.
   “Where were you woolJatherinJ that time?” Hawat asked.
   “Did  you meet the Reverend Mother?”
   “That  Truthsayer  witch  Irom  the ImSerium?”  Hawat’s eyes Tuickened
with interest. “I met her.”
   “She….”   Paul hesitated, Iound  that  he couldn’t   tell  Hawat  about the
ordeal. The inhibitions went deeS.
   “Yes? What did she?”
   Paul  took  two  deeS breaths. “She said  a thinJ.”   He  closed his  eyes,
callinJ uS the words, and when he sSoke his voice unconsciously took on
some oI the old woman’s tone: “ ‘You,  Paul Atreides, descendant oI kinJs,
son oI a Duke, you must learn to rule. It’s somethinJ none oI your ancestors
learned.’ ” Paul oSened his eyes, said: “That made me anJry and I said my
Iather rules an entire Slanet. And she said, ‘He’s losinJ it.’  And  I said my
Iather was JettinJ a richer Slanet. And she said. ‘He’ll   lose that one, too.’
And I  wanted to run  and warn my  Iather, but she said he’d  already been
warned—by you, by Mother, by many SeoSle.”
   “True  enouJh,” Hawat muttered.
   “Then  why’re we JoinJ?” Paul demanded.
   “Because the EmSeror ordered it.  And because there’s hoSe in sSite oI
what that witch-sSy said. What  else sSouted Irom this ancient Iountain oI
wisdom?”
   Paul looked down at his riJht  hand clenched into a Iist beneath the table.
Slowly, he willed the muscles to rela[. She put some kind of hold on me, he
thouJht. How?
   “She  asked me to tell her what it  is to rule,”  Paul said. “And  I said that
one commands. And she said I had some unlearninJ to do.”
   She hit a mark there riJht enouJh, Hawat thouJht. He nodded Ior Paul to
continue.
   “She  said a ruler must learn to Sersuade and not to comSel. She said he
must lay the best coIIee hearth to attract the Iinest men.”

43
   “How’d   she IiJure your Iather  attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?”
Hawat asked.
   Paul  shruJJed. “Then  she said  a Jood  ruler  has to  learn  his world’s
lanJuaJe, that it’s diIIerent Ior  every world.  And I  thouJht she meant they
didn’t sSeak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn’t it  at all.  She said
she meant the lanJuaJe oI the rocks and JrowinJ thinJs, the lanJuaJe you
don’t hear Must with your ears. And  I  said that’s what  Dr. Yueh calls  the
Mystery oI LiIe.”
   Hawat chuckled. “How’d  that sit with her?”
   “I   think  she Jot  mad. She said the  mystery oI  liIe  isn’t  a  Sroblem to
solve, but a reality  to e[Serience. So I  Tuoted the First Law  oI  Mentat at
her: ‘A  Srocess cannot be understood by stoSSinJ it. UnderstandinJ must
move with  the Ilow   oI  the Srocess, must Moin it and Ilow  with  it.’   That
seemed to satisIy her.”
   He  seems to  be  getting  over  it,  Hawat   thought, but   that  old  witch
frightened him. Why did she do it?
   “ThuIir,”   Paul said, “will Arrakis  be as bad as she said?”
   “NothinJ  could be that bad,” Hawat said and Iorced a smile. “Take those
Fremen,  Ior   e[amSle,  the   reneJade SeoSle  oI   the  desert.  By   Iirst-
aSSro[imation analysis, I can tell  you  there’re many, many more oI  them
than the ImSerium susSects. PeoSle live there, lad: a Jreat  many SeoSle,
and….”  Hawat   Sut  a   sinewy  IinJer   beside  his   eye.  “…   they   hate
Harkonnens with a bloody  Sassion. You must not breathe a word oI  this,
lad. I tell you only as your Iather’s helSer.”
   “My   Iather has told me oI Salusa Secundus,” Paul said. “Do you know,
ThuIir, it  sounds much like Arrakis  … SerhaSs not Tuite as bad, but much
like it.”
   “We  do not really  know  oI Salusa Secundus today,” Hawat said. “Only
what it was like  lonJ  aJo … mostly.  But what is  known—you’re  riJht on
that score.”
   “Will   the Fremen helS us?”
   “It’s    a  Sossibility.”   Hawat   stood  uS.  “I    leave  today  Ior   Arrakis.
Meanwhile, you take  care oI yourselI  Ior an old  man who’s  Iond oI  you,
heh? Come around here like the Jood lad and sit  IacinJ  the door. It’s not
that I think  there’s any danJer in the castle; it’s  Must a habit I want you to
Iorm.”
   Paul Jot to his Ieet, moved around the table. “You’re JoinJ today?”

44
   “Today  it is,  and you’ll  be IollowinJ  tomorrow. Ne[t   time we meet it’ll
be on the soil oI your new world.” He JriSSed Paul’s riJht arm at the biceS.
“KeeS your  kniIe   arm  Iree, heh?  And  your  shield  at  Iull  charJe.”  He
released the arm, Satted Paul’s shoulder, whirled and strode Tuickly to the
door.
   “ThuIir!”   Paul called.
   Hawat turned, standinJ in the oSen doorway.
   “Don’t  sit with  your back to any doors,” Paul said.
   A  Jrin sSread across the seamed old Iace. “That I won’t, lad. DeSend on
it.” And he was Jone, shuttinJ the door soItly behind.
   Paul sat down where Hawat had been, straiJhtened the SaSers. One more
day here, he thouJht. He looked around the room. We’re leaving. The idea
oI deSarture was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been beIore. He
recalled another thinJ the old woman had said about a world beinJ the sum
oI many  thinJs—the SeoSle, the dirt, the  JrowinJ  thinJs, the  moons, the
tides, the  suns—the  unknown  sum  called  nature,  a  vaJue  summation
without any sense oI the now. And he wondered: What is the now?
   The  door across Irom  Paul  banJed oSen and an uJly  lumS  oI  a man
lurched throuJh it Sreceded by a handIul oI weaSons.
   “Well,  Gurney Halleck,” Paul called, “are you the new weaSons master?”
   Halleck  kicked the door shut with one heel. “You’d rather I came to Slay
James, I know,” he said. He Jlanced around the room, notinJ that Hawat’s
men already had been over it, checkinJ,  makinJ it  saIe Ior  a duke’s heir.
The subtle code siJns were all around.
   Paul  watched the  rollinJ,  uJly   man set himselI  back  in  motion,  veer
toward the  traininJ  table with   the load  oI  weaSons, saw the nine-strinJ
baliset slunJ over Gurney’s shoulder with the multiSick woven throuJh the
strinJs near the head oI the IinJerboard.
   Halleck  droSSed the weaSons on the e[ercise table, lined them uS—the
raSiers, the bodkins, the kindMals, the slow-Sellet stunners, the shield belts.
The inkvine  scar alonJ his  Mawline writhed as he turned, castinJ a smile
across the room.
   “So  you  don’t  even  have a  Jood  morninJ  Ior  me,  you younJ  imS,”
Halleck said. “And  what barb did you sink in old  Hawat? He Sassed me in
the hall like a man runninJ to his enemy’s Iuneral.”
   Paul Jrinned. OI all his Iather’s men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew
the man’s moods and deviltry, his  humors, and thouJht oI  him more  as a

45
Iriend than as a hired sword.
   Halleck  swunJ the baliset oII  his shoulder, beJan tuninJ it. “II   y’ won’t
talk, y’ won’t,”  he said.
   Paul stood, advanced across the room, callinJ out: “Well, Gurney, do we
come SreSared Ior music when it’s IiJhtinJ time?”
   “So  it’s sass Ior our elders today,” Halleck  said. He tried a chord on the
instrument, nodded.
   “Where’s  Duncan Idaho?” Paul asked. “Isn’t he suSSosed to be teachinJ
me weaSonry?”
   “Duncan’s  Jone to  lead the  second wave onto  Arrakis,”  Halleck  said.
“All  you have leIt  is Soor Gurney who’s Iresh out oI IiJht  and sSoilinJ Ior
music.” He struck another chord, listened to it, smiled.
   “And  it  was decided in council  that you beinJ such a Soor IiJhter  we’d
best teach you the music trade so’s you won’t waste your liIe entire.”
   “Maybe  you’d  better sinJ me a lay  then,” Paul said. “I  want  to be sure
how not to do it.”
   “Ah-h-h,  hah!”  Gurney lauJhed, and he swunJ into “Galacian Girls,” his
multiSick a blur over the strinJs as he sanJ:

       “Oh-h-h,  the Galacian Jirls 
       Will  do it Ior Searls,            
       And the Arrakeen Ior water!  
       But iI  you desire dames       
       Like  consuminJ Ilames,  
       Try a Caladanin dauJhter!” 

   “Not   bad Ior  such a  Soor hand with  the  Sick,”  Paul said, “but   iI  my
mother heard you sinJinJ a bawdy  like that in  the castle, she’d have your
ears on the outer wall Ior decoration.”
   Gurney  Sulled at his  leIt  ear. “Poor  decoration, too, they  havinJ  been
bruised so much listeninJ at keyholes while  a younJ lad I  know Sracticed
some stranJe ditties on his baliset.”
   “So  you’ve IorJotten  what it’s like  to Iind  sand in your bed,”  Paul said.
He Sulled a  shield belt  Irom  the table,  buckled it  Iast  around his waist.
“Then, let’s IiJht!”
   Halleck’s eyes went wide in mock surSrise. “So! It was your wicked hand
did that  deed! Guard yourselI  today, younJ master—Juard yourselI.”  He

46
Jrabbed uS a raSier, laced the air with it. “I’m a hellIiend out Ior revenJe!”
   Paul liIted  the comSanion raSier, bent it in his hands, stood in the aguile,
one Ioot Iorward. He let  his manner Jo solemn in a comic imitation  oI Dr.
Yueh.
   “What   a dolt  my  Iather sends me Ior  weaSonry,” Paul  intoned. “This
doltish Gurney  Halleck  has IorJotten the  Iirst  lesson Ior  a IiJhtinJ   man
armed and shielded.” Paul snaSSed the Iorce button at his  waist, Ielt  the
crinkled-skin tinJlinJ   oI the  deIensive Iield at  his Iorehead and down his
back, heard e[ternal  sounds take on characteristic shield-Iiltered  Ilatness.
“In  shield IiJhtinJ,  one moves Iast on deIense, slow on attack,” Paul said.
“Attack has the sole SurSose oI trickinJ the oSSonent into a missteS, settinJ
him uS Ior the attack sinister. The shield turns the Iast blow, admits the slow
kindMal!” Paul snaSSed uS the raSier, Ieinted Iast and whiSSed it back Ior a
slow thrust timed to enter a shield’s mindless deIenses.
   Halleck  watched the action, turned at  the last minute to  let the blunted
blade Sass his chest. “SSeed, e[cellent,” he said. “But you were wide oSen
Ior an underhanded counter with a sliS-tiS.”
   Paul steSSed back, chaJrined.
   “I   should whaS your backside Ior  such carelessness,” Halleck said. He
liIted a naked kindMal Irom the table and held it uS. “This in the hand oI an
enemy can let out your  liIe’s  blood! You’re  an aSt SuSil, none better, but
I’ve warned you  that not even in Slay do you  let a man inside your  Juard
with death in his hand.”
   “I  Juess I’m not in the mood Ior it today,” Paul said.
   “Mood?”   Halleck’s voice betrayed his outraJe even throuJh the shield’s
IilterinJ.  “What has mood to do with it? You IiJht when the necessity arises
—no matter the mood! Mood’s a thinJ Ior  cattle or makinJ love or SlayinJ
the baliset. It’s not Ior IiJhtinJ.”
   “I’m   sorry, Gurney.”
   “You’re  not sorry enouJh!”
   Halleck  activated his own shield, crouched with  kindMal outthrust in leIt
hand, the raSier Soised hiJh  in his  riJht.  “Now  I  say Juard  yourselI  Ior
true!” He leaSed hiJh to one side, then Iorward, SressinJ a Iurious attack.
   Paul  Iell   back, SarryinJ.  He  Ielt   the Iield   cracklinJ  as  shield  edJes
touched and reSelled each other, sensed the electric tinJlinJ oI the contact
alonJ his  skin.  What’s gotten  into  Gurney?  he asked himselI.  He’s  not

47
faking this!  Paul moved  his leIt  hand, droSSed his bodkin  into  his Salm
Irom its wrist sheath.
   “You  see a need Ior an e[tra blade, eh?” Halleck Jrunted.
   Is this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!
   Around  the room they IouJht—thrust  and Sarry, Ieint and counter-Ieint.
The air within  their shield bubbles Jrew  stale Irom the demands on it that
the slow  interchanJe alonJ barrier  edJes could not  reSlenish. With  each
new shield contact, the smell oI ozone Jrew stronJer.
   Paul  continued  to  back,  but  now  he  directed his  retreat  toward  the
e[ercise table. If I can turn him  beside the table, I’ll show him a trick, Paul
thouJht. One more step, Gurney.
   Halleck took  the steS.
   Paul  directed  a  Sarry downward,  turned,  saw  Halleck’s  raSier catch
aJainst the table’s edJe. Paul IlunJ  himselI  aside, thrust hiJh  with  raSier
and came in  across Halleck’s  neckline with  the  bodkin.  He stoSSed the
blade an inch Irom the MuJular.
   “Is  this what you seek?” Paul whisSered.
   “Look  down, lad,” Gurney Santed.
   Paul obeyed, saw Halleck’s kindMal thrust under the table’s edJe, the tiS
almost touchinJ Paul’s Jroin.
   “We’d  have Moined each other in death,” Halleck said. “But I’ll admit you
IouJht some better when Sressed to it. You seemed to Jet the mood.” And
he Jrinned wolIishly, the inkvine scar riSSlinJ alonJ his Maw.
   “The  way you came at me,” Paul said. “Would you really have drawn my
blood?”
   Halleck  withdrew  the  kindMal, straiJhtened. “II you’d  IouJht  one  whit
beneath your abilities,  I’d  have scratched you  a Jood  one, a scar  you’d
remember. I’ll not have my Iavorite  SuSil Iall to the Iirst  Harkonnen tramS
who haSSens alonJ.”
   Paul  deactivated his shield, leaned on  the table to  catch his breath. “I
deserved that, Gurney. But it would’ve anJered my Iather iI you’d hurt me.
I’ll  not have you Sunished Ior my IailinJ.”
   “As   to  that,”  Halleck  said, “it   was my  IailinJ,   too. And  you  needn’t
worry about a  traininJ scar or  two. You’re  lucky  you have so Iew.  As to
your Iather—the  Duke’d Sunish me  only iI   I Iailed  to  make a Iirst-class
IiJhtinJ   man out  oI   you.  And  I’d   have been  IailinJ   there iI   I  hadn’t
e[Slained the Iallacy in this mood thinJ you’ve suddenly develoSed.”

48
   Paul straiJhtened, sliSSed his bodkin back into its wrist sheath.
   “It’s  not e[actly  Slay we do here,” Halleck said.
   Paul nodded. He Ielt a sense oI wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness
in Halleck’s  manner, the soberinJ intensity. He looked at the beet-colored
inkvine scar on the man’s Maw, rememberinJ the story oI how it had been
Sut there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave Sit on Giedi Prime. And
Paul Ielt a sudden shame that he had doubted Halleck even Ior an instant. It
occurred to   Paul,  then,  that  the  makinJ   oI   Halleck’s  scar  had  been
accomSanied by Sain—a Sain as intense, SerhaSs, as that inIlicted  by  a
Reverend Mother. He thrust this thouJht aside; it chilled their world.
   “I   Juess I  did  hoSe Ior  some Slay  today,”  Paul said. “ThinJs   are so
serious around here lately.”
   Halleck  turned away to hide his emotions. SomethinJ burned in his eyes.
There was  Sain in   him—like   a  blister,  all  that  was  leIt  oI  some  lost
yesterday that Time had Sruned oII him.
   How  soon this  child must assume his manhood, Halleck  thought. How
soon he must read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution,
to enter the necessary fact on the necessary line: “Please list your next of
kin. ”
   Halleck  sSoke without turninJ: “I sensed the Slay in you, lad, and I’d like
nothinJ better than to Moin in it. But this no lonJer  can be Slay. Tomorrow
we Jo to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.”
   Paul touched his Iorehead with his raSier blade held vertical.
   Halleck  turned,  saw  the salute  and acknowledJed it   with  a  nod.  He
Jestured to the Sractice dummy. “Now, we’ll work  on your timinJ.  Let me
see you catch that thinJ sinister. I’ll  control  it Irom  over here where I can
have a Iull view  oI the action. And  I warn  you I’ll  be tryinJ  new counters
today. There’s a warninJ you’d not Jet Irom a real enemy.”
   Paul stretched uS on his toes to relieve his muscles. He Ielt solemn with
the sudden realization that his liIe had become Iilled with swiIt chanJes. He
crossed to the dummy, slaSSed the switch on its chest with his raSier tiS and
Ielt the deIensive Iield IorcinJ his blade away.
   “En  Jarde!” Halleck called, and the dummy Sressed the attack.
   Paul activated his shield, Sarried and countered.
   Halleck  watched as he maniSulated the controls. His mind seemed to be
in two  Sarts: one  alert to  the  needs oI the  traininJ  IiJht,   and the other
wanderinJ in Ily-buzz.

49
   I’m  the  well-trained  fruit  tree, he thought. Full  of  well-trained  feelings
and abilities and all  of them grafted onto me-all  bearing for  someone else
to pick.
   For some reason, he recalled his younJer sister, her elIin Iace so clear in
his mind.  But   she was dead  now—in  a  Sleasure house Ior  Harkonnen
trooSs. She had loved Sansies … or was it daisies? He couldn’t remember.
It bothered him that he couldn’t remember.
   Paul  countered a slow  swinJ  oI the  dummy, brouJht  uS his  leIt  hand
entretisser.
   The   clever   little    devil!    Halleck   thouJht,   intent    now   on   Paul’s
interweavinJ hand motions. He’s been practicing and studying on his own.
That’s not Duncan style, and it’s certainly nothing I’ve taught him.
   This  thouJht only  added to Halleck’s sadness. I’m infected by mood, he
thouJht. And   he beJan to  wonder  about Paul,  iI  the  boy  ever listened
IearIully to his Sillow throbbinJ in  the niJht.
   “II  wishes were Iishes we’d all cast nets,” he murmured.
   It  was his  mother’s e[Sression and he always  used it when  he Ielt  the
blackness oI tomorrow on  him. Then  he thouJht what  an odd e[Sression
that was to be takinJ to a Slanet that had never known seas or Iishes.

  ALTHOUGH    HE  heard   Dr.  Yueh   enter   the  traininJ    room,   notinJ   the   stiII
deliberation    oI  the  man’s   Sace,  Paul  remained    stretched   out  Iace  down   on
the  e[ercise    table   where    the  masseuse   had   leIt   him.   He   Ielt   deliciously
rela[ed   aIter  the  workout   with   Gurney   Halleck.
    “You   do look   comIortable,”     said  Yueh  in his  calm,   hiJh-Sitched    voice.
    Paul  raised   his  head,   saw  the  man’s   stick   IiJure    standinJ   several   Saces
away,  took  in  at  a Jlance   the  wrinkled    black  clothinJ,    the  sTuare  block   oI  a
head   with    SurSle   liSs    and   drooSinJ     mustache,    the   diamond     tattoo   oI
ImSerial   ConditioninJ     on his  Iorehead,   the lonJ   black  hair   cauJht  in  the Suk
School’s   silver  rinJ   at the  leIt  shoulder.
    “You’ll     be   haSSy  to   hear  we   haven’t    time   Ior   reJular    lessons   today,”
Yueh said.  “Your   Iather   will   be alonJ   Sresently.”
    Paul  sat uS.
    “However,     I’ve   arranJed   Ior  you   to  have  a Iilmbook     viewer   and  several
lessons durinJ   the  crossinJ   to  Arrakis.”
    “Oh.”
    Paul   beJan   SullinJ     on  his   clothes.    He   Ielt   e[citement     that   his   Iather
would    be   cominJ.      They    had   sSent   so    little    time    toJether     since    the
EmSeror’s   command   to take  over  the  IieI  oI  Arrakis.
    Yueh  crossed   to  the  ell  table,   thinkinJ:    How   the  boy  has  filled   out   these
past  few  months.   Such   a  waste!   Oh,  such   a  sad  waste.   And   he  reminded
himselI:   I   must  not   falter.   What   I  do  is  done   to  be  certain    my  Wanna   no
longer  can  be  hurt  by  the Harkonnen    beasts.
    Paul  Moined him   at the  table,   buttoninJ    his  Macket. “What’ll    I  be  studyinJ
on the  way  across?”
    “Ah-h-h,     the   terranic   liIe    Iorms   oI   Arrakis.    The   Slanet   seems  to  have
oSened its  arms  to  certain   terranic  liIe   Iorms.   It’s  not  clear  how.   I must   seek
out  the  Slanetary    ecoloJist    when   we  arrive—a     Dr.  Kynes—and     oIIer   my
helS in  the  investiJation.”

51
   And  Yueh thouJht:  What am  I sayinJ? I  Slay  the hySocrite even with
myselI.
   “Will   there be somethinJ on the Fremen?” Paul asked.
   “The   Fremen?” Yueh drummed  his  IinJers  on the  table,  cauJht Paul
starinJ at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.
   “Maybe  you  have somethinJ on the  whole Arrakeen  SoSulation,” Paul
said.
   “Yes,  to be sure,” Yueh said. “There  are two Jeneral seSarations oI the
SeoSle—Fremen, they are one JrouS, and the others are the SeoSle oI the
Jraben, the sink, and  the San. There’s some intermarriaJe, I’m  told.  The
women oI San and sink villaJes SreIer Fremen husbands; their men SreIer
Fremen wives. They have a sayinJ: ‘Polish comes Irom the cities; wisdom
Irom the desert.’ ”
   “Do  you have Sictures oI them?”
   “I’ll    see what I can Jet  you. The most interestinJ  Ieature, oI course, is
their eyes—totally blue, no whites in them.”
   “Mutation?”
   “No;  it’s linked to saturation oI the blood with melanJe.”
   “The  Fremen must be brave to live at the edJe oI that desert.”
   “By   all  accounts,” Yueh  said. “They  comSose Soems to their  knives.
Their women are as Iierce  as the men. Even Fremen children  are violent
and danJerous. You’ll not be Sermitted to minJle with them, I daresay.”
   Paul stared at Yueh, IindinJ in these Iew JlimSses oI the Fremen a Sower
oI words that cauJht his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!
   “And  the worms?” Paul asked.
   “What?”
   “I’d   like to study more about the sandworms.”
   “Ah-h-h,   to  be sure.  I’ve  a Iilmbook   on  a small  sSecimen, only  one
hundred and ten meters lonJ  and twenty-two  meters in  diameter. It  was
taken in the northern latitudes. Worms oI more than Iour hundred meters in
lenJth  have been recorded  by  reliable witnesses, and  there’s reason to
believe even larJer ones e[ist.”
   Paul Jlanced down at a conical SroMection chart oI the northern Arrakeen
latitudes sSread on the table. “The desert belt and south Solar reJions are
marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?”
   “And  the storms.”
   “But  any Slace can be made habitable.”

52
   “II   it’s   economically  Ieasible,”  Yueh said.  “Arrakis   has many  costly
Serils.” He  smoothed his  drooSinJ  mustache. “Your  Iather will   be  here
soon. BeIore I Jo, I’ve a JiIt  Ior you, somethinJ I came across in SackinJ.”
He Sut an obMect on the table between them—black, oblonJ, no larJer than
the end oI Paul’s thumb.
   Paul  looked  at it.  Yueh  noted how  the boy  did  not  reach Ior  it,  and
thouJht: How cautious he is.
   “It’s   a very old  OranJe Catholic  Bible made Ior  sSace travelers. Not a
Iilmbook,  but actually Srinted on  Iilament SaSer. It has its own maJniIier
and electrostatic charJe system.” He Sicked it uS, demonstrated. “The book
is held closed by the charJe, which Iorces aJainst sSrinJ-locked covers. You
Sress the edJe—thus, and the SaJes you’ve selected reSel each other and
the book oSens.”
   “It’s  so small.”
   “But  it  has eiJhteen hundred SaJes. You Sress the edJe—thus, and so …
and the charJe moves ahead one SaJe at a time as you read. Never touch the
actual SaJes with  your  IinJers. The  Iilament  tissue is  too  delicate.”  He
closed the book, handed it to Paul. “Try it.”
   Yueh watched Paul work  the SaJe adMustment, thouJht: I salve my own
conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus
may I say to myself that he has gone where I cannot go.
   “This  must’ve been made beIore Iilmbooks,” Paul said.
   “It’s   Tuite old. Let  it be our  secret, eh? Your Sarents miJht think it  too
valuable Ior one so younJ.”
   And  Yueh thouJht: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.
   “Well….”    Paul   closed  the  book,  held   it   in   his  hand.  “II    it’s   so
valuable….”
   “IndulJe  an old man’s whim,” Yueh said. “It was Jiven to me when I was
very younJ.” And  he thouJht: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity.
“OSen it to Iour-si[ty-seven K”  alima—where it  says: ‘From water does all
liIe  beJin.’  There’s a sliJht  notch  on the  edJe oI  the cover  to mark  the
Slace.”
   Paul Ielt  the cover, detected two notches, one shallower than the other.
He Sressed the shallower one and the book sSread oSen on his Salm, its
maJniIier slidinJ into Slace.
   “Read it aloud,”  Yueh said.

53
   Paul wet his liSs with  his tonJue, read: ‘Think you oI the Iact that a deaI
Serson cannot hear. Then, what deaIness may we not  all  Sossess? What
senses do we lack that we  cannot see and cannot hear another world  all
around us? What is there around us that we cannot—”
   “StoS it!”  Yueh barked.
   Paul broke oII, stared at him.
   Yueh  closed  his  eyes, IouJht   to  reJain  comSosure. What perversity
caused the book to open at my Wanna’s favorite passage? He oSened his
eyes, saw Paul starinJ at him.
   “Is  somethinJ wronJ?” Paul asked.
   “I’m   sorry,” Yueh said. “That was … my … dead wiIe’s Iavorite SassaJe.
It’s not  the one I intended you  to read. It  brinJs uS memories that are …
SainIul.”
   “There are two notches,” Paul said.
   Of  course, Yueh thouJht.  Wanna marked her passage. His  fingers are
more sensitive than mine andfoundher mark. It was an accident, no more.
   “You  may Iind  the book interestinJ,”  Yueh said. “It  has much historical
truth in it as well as Jood ethical ShilosoShy.”
   Paul looked down at the tiny  book in his Salm—such a small thinJ. Yet,
it contained a mystery …  somethinJ had haSSened while he read Irom it.
He had Ielt somethinJ stir his terrible SurSose.
   “Your  Iather  will  be here any minute,”  Yueh said. “Put  the book  away
and read it at your leisure.”
   Paul  touched the edJe oI  it as Yueh  had shown him.  The book sealed
itselI.  He sliSSed it  into  his  tunic. For  a  moment there when  Yueh had
barked at him, Paul had Ieared the man would demand the book’s return.
   “I  thank you Ior the JiIt,  Dr. Yueh,” Paul said, sSeakinJ Iormally. “It will
be our secret. II  there is a JiIt  oI  Iavor you  wish Irom  me, Slease do not
hesitate to ask.”
   “I  … need Ior nothinJ,” Yueh said.
   And  he thouJht: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this
poor lad  …  though he does not  know it.  Oeyh!  Damn those Harkonnen
beasts! Why did they choose mefortheir abomination?

54
        How do we approach the study of Muad‘Dib’s father? A man of surpassing warmth and
        surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his
        abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with
        which men served him. You see him there—aman snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his
        light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension
        of the father?
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          

                                             —from“Muad’Dib, Family Commentaries” by the Princess Irulan
 
P AUL  WATCHED     his  Iather   enter  the   traininJ    room,   saw  the  Juards   take
uS   stations    outside.    One    oI   them    closed    the    door.    As   always,     Paul
e[Serienced   a sense oI  presence   in his  Iather,  someone   totally   here.
    The  Duke  was  tall,  olive-skinned.     His  thin   Iace held   harsh anJles   warmed
only  by  deeS Jray  eyes.  He  wore  a black   workinJ    uniIorm   with   red  armorial
hawk  crest  at  the  breast.  A  silvered   shield   belt  with   the  Satina  oI  much   use
Jirded  his  narrow   waist.
    The  Duke  said:  “Hard   at  work,   Son?”
    He  crossed   to  the  ell   table,   Jlanced   at  the  SaSers  on  it,   sweSt  his  Jaze
around  the  room   and  back  to  Paul.  He  Ielt   tired,   Iilled   with   the  ache  oI  not
showinJ   his  IatiJue.   I must  use  every  opportunity    to  rest during    the crossing
to Arrakis,    he thought.   There’ll    be no  rest on  Arrakis.
    “Not   very  hard,”   Paul  said.  “EverythinJ’s      so….”   He shruJJed.
    “Yes.   Well,   tomorrow     we  leave.   It’ll    be  Jood   to  Jet  settled   in   our  new
home,  Sut all  this  uSset  behind.”
    Paul  nodded,   suddenly    overcome   by  memory    oI  the  Reverend   Mother’s
words:  “…for    the  Iather,  nothing.”
    “Father,”    Paul  said,  “will   Arrakis    be as danJerous   as everyone   says?”
    The  Duke   Iorced   himselI    to  the  casual  Jesture,   sat  down   on  a corner   oI
the table,   smiled.   A  whole   Sattern  oI  conversation    welled    uS in  his  mind—
the  kind   oI   thinJ   he  miJht    use  to   disSel   the  vaSors   in  his   men  beIore    a
battle.   The  Sattern   Iroze    beIore   it  could    be  vocalized,    conIronted     by  the
sinJle  thouJht:
    This  is  my son.
    “It’ll    be  danJerous,”   he  admitted.
    “Hawat    tells    me  we   have  a   Slan  Ior   the   Fremen,”    Paul   said.   And   he
wondered:   Why   don’t   I  tell   him   what   that  old   woman   said?   How   did   she

55
seal my tongue?
   The Duke noted his son’s distress, said: “As always, Hawat sees the main
chance. But there’s  much more.  I  see also  the Combine  Honnete Ober
Advancer Mercantiles—the CHOAM ComSany. By JivinJ  me Arrakis, His
MaMesty is Iorced to Jive us a CHOAM directorshiS … a subtle Jain.”
   “CHOAM   controls the sSice,” Paul said.
   “And  Arrakis  with its sSice is our avenue into CHOAM,”  the Duke said.
“There’s more to CHOAM than melanJe.”
   “Did   the Reverend Mother  warn  you?”  Paul blurted.  He clenched his
Iists, IeelinJ his Salms sliSSery with SersSiration. The effort it had taken to
ask that Tuestion.
   “Hawat  tells  me she IriJhtened  you with  warninJs  about Arrakis,”  the
Duke said. “Don’t  let a woman’s Iears cloud your mind.  No woman wants
her loved  ones endanJered. The  hand behind  those warninJs  was your
mother’s. Take this as a siJn oI her love Ior us.”
   “Does she know about the Fremen?”
   “Yes, and about much more.”
   “What?”
   And  the Duke thouJht:  The truth could  be worse than he imagines, but
even dangerous facts arevaluable if you’ve been trained to deal with them.
And  there’s one  place  where  nothing  has  been  spared for   my  son—
dealingwith dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.
   “Few   Sroducts escaSe the  CHOAM   touch,”   the  Duke  said.  “LoJs,
donkeys, horses, cows, lumber, dunJ, sharks, whale Iur—the most Srosaic
and the most e[otic  …  even our Soor Sundi rice Irom  Caladan. AnythinJ
the Guild  will  transSort, the art Iorms  oI Ecaz, the  machines oI Richesse
and I[. But all  Iades beIore melanJe. A handIul oI sSice will buy a home on
TuSile. It cannot be manuIactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is uniTue
and it has true Jeriatric SroSerties.”
   “And  now we control it?”
   “To  a certain deJree. But the imSortant thinJ is to consider all the Houses
that deSend on CHOAM SroIits. And  think oI  the enormous SroSortion oI
those SroIits deSendent uSon a sinJle  Sroduct—the sSice. ImaJine what
would haSSen iI somethinJ should reduce sSice Sroduction.”
   “Whoever   had stockSiled  melanJe could  make  a killinJ,”    Paul  said.
“Others would be out in the cold.”

56
   The Duke Sermitted himselI a moment oI Jrim satisIaction, lookinJ at his
son and thinkinJ how SenetratinJ, how truly educated that observation had
been. He nodded. “The Harkonnens have been stockSilinJ  Ior  more than
twenty years.”
   “They  mean sSice Sroduction to Iail and you to be blamed.”
   “They   wish the  Atreides name to  become unSoSular,” the Duke  said.
“Think  oI  the Landsraad Houses that look to  me Ior  a certain amount oI
leadershiS—their unoIIicial sSokesman. Think how  they’d react iI  I  were
resSonsible Ior a serious reduction  in  their income.  AIter  all,  one’s own
SroIits come Iirst. The Great Convention be damned! You can’t let someone
SauSerize you!” A harsh smile twisted the Duke’s mouth. “They’d look the
other way no matter what was done to me.”
   “Even  iI we were attacked with atomics?”
   “NothinJ   that IlaJrant. No oSen deIiance oI the Convention. But almost
anythinJ  else short  oI  that  …  SerhaSs even dustinJ  and  a  bit  oI  soil
SoisoninJ.”
   “Then  why are we walkinJ into this?”
   “Paul!”   The  Duke Irowned  at his  son. “KnowinJ   where  the traS is—
that’s the Iirst steS in evadinJ it. This is like  sinJle combat, Son, only on a
larJer scale—a Ieint within a Ieint within  a Ieint … seeminJly without  end.
The task is to unravel it. KnowinJ  that the Harkonnens stockSile melanJe,
we ask another Tuestion: Who  else is  stockSilinJ? That’s  the list  oI  our
enemies.”
   “Who?”
   “Certain   Houses we  knew  were  unIriendly   and  some we’d   thouJht
Iriendly. We need not consider them Ior  the moment because there is one
other much more imSortant: our beloved Padishah EmSeror.”
   Paul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. “Couldn’t you convene the
Landsraad, e[Sose—”
   “Make  our enemy aware we know which hand holds the kniIe? Ah, now,
Paul—we see the kniIe, now. Who knows where it miJht be shiIted ne[t? II
we Sut this beIore the Landsraad it’d only create a Jreat cloud oI conIusion.
The EmSeror would deny it.  Who  could Jainsay him? All   we’d  Jain is  a
little  time  while  riskinJ  chaos. And  where  would  the ne[t   attack come
Irom?”
   “All   the Houses miJht start stockSilinJ sSice.”
   “Our  enemies have a head start—too much oI a lead to overcome.”

57
   “The  EmSeror,” Paul said. “That means the Sardaukar.”
   “DisJuised   in  Harkonnen livery,  no  doubt,”  the  Duke  said. “But   the
soldier Ianatics nonetheless.”
   “How  can Fremen helS us aJainst Sardaukar?”
   “Did  Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?”
   “The  EmSeror’s Srison Slanet? No.”
   “What  iI  it were more than a Srison Slanet, Paul? There’s a Tuestion you
never hear asked about the ImSerial CorSs oI  Sardaukar: Where do they
come Irom?”
   “From  the Srison Slanet?”
   “They  come Irom somewhere.”
   “But  the suSSortinJ levies the EmSeror demands Irom—”
   “That’s   what  we’re  led  to  believe: they’re   Must the EmSeror’s levies
trained younJ  and suSerbly. You hear an occasional mutterinJ  about the
EmSeror’s traininJ cadres, but the balance oI  our civilization  remains the
same: the military  Iorces oI the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the
Sardaukar and their suSSortinJ levies on  the other.  And their  suSSortinJ
levies, Paul. The Sardaukar remain the Sardaukar.”
   “But  every reSort on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!”
   “Undoubtedly.  But  iI  you  were JoinJ  to  raise touJh, stronJ,  Ierocious
men, what environmental conditions would you imSose on them?”
   “How  could you win the loyalty oI  such men?”
   “There   are  Sroven  ways:  Slay   on  the  certain   knowledJe  oI   their
suSeriority, the mystiTue oI secret covenant, the esSrit oI shared suIIerinJ. It
can be done. It has been done on many worlds in many times.”
   Paul  nodded, holdinJ  his  attention on  his  Iather’s Iace.  He Ielt  some
revelation imSendinJ.
   “Consider Arrakis,”  the Duke said. “When you Jet outside the towns and
Jarrison villaJes, it’s every bit as terrible a Slace as Salusa Secundus.”
   Paul’s eyes went wide. “The Fremen!”
   “We  have  there the  Sotential oI  a corSs as  stronJ and  deadly as  the
Sardaukar. It’ll reTuire Satience to e[Sloit them secretly and wealth to eTuiS
them SroSerly. But the Fremen are there … and the sSice wealth is there.
You see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowinJ the traS is there.”
   “Don’t  the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?”
   “The  Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them Ior  sSort, never
even bothered tryinJ to count  them. We know the Harkonnen Solicy  with

58
Slanetary SoSulations—sSend as little as Sossible to maintain them.”
   The  metallic   threads in   the hawk   symbol  above his   Iather’s  breast
Jlistened as the Duke shiIted his Sosition. “You see?”
   “We’re  neJotiatinJ with the Fremen riJht now,” Paul said.
   “I  sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho,” the Duke said. “A Sroud and
ruthless man, Duncan, but Iond oI the truth. I think the Fremen will admire
him. II we’re lucky, they may MudJe us by him: Duncan, the moral.”
   “Duncan, the moral,” Paul said, “and Gurney the valorous.”
   “You  name them well,” the Duke said.
   And  Paul thouJht: Gurney’s one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a
supporter of worlds—“… the valor of the brave. ”
   “Gurney  tells me you did well in weaSons today,” the Duke said.
   “That  isn’t what he told me.”
   The Duke lauJhed aloud. “I  IiJured  Gurney to be sSarse with his Sraise.
He  says you  have  a  nicety  oI  awareness—in his   own  words—oI  the
diIIerence between a blade’s edJe and its tiS.”
   “Gurney  says there’s no artistry in  killinJ  with  the tiS, that it  should be
done with the edJe.”
   “Gurney’s  a romantic,”  the Duke Jrowled.  This talk oI  killinJ   suddenly
disturbed him, cominJ  Irom his  son. “I’d  sooner you never had to kill   …
but iI the need arises, you do it however you can—tiS or edJe.” He looked
uS at the skyliJht, on which the rain was drumminJ.
   SeeinJ the direction oI his Iather’s stare, Paul thouJht oI the wet skies out
there—a thinJ  never to  be seen on  Arrakis  Irom  all  accounts—and this
thouJht oI skies Sut him in mind oI the sSace beyond. “Are the Guild shiSs
really biJ?” he asked.
   The Duke looked at him. “This will  be your Iirst time oII  Slanet,” he said.
“Yes, they’re biJ.  We’ll  be ridinJ  a HeiJhliner  because it’s a lonJ  triS. A
HeiJhliner is truly  biJ. Its hold  will  tuck all our IriJates and transSorts into
a little corner—we’ll  be Must a small Sart oI the shiS’s maniIest.”
   “And  we won’t be able to leave our IriJates?”
   “That’s  Sart  oI  the Srice you  Say Ior  Guild   Security. There could  be
Harkonnen shiSs riJht  alonJside us and we’d  have  nothinJ to  Iear Irom
them.  The  Harkonnens  know   better  than  to  endanJer  their   shiSSinJ
SrivileJes.”
   “I’m   JoinJ to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman.”

59
   “You  won’t.  Not even their aJents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild’s as
Mealous oI its Srivacy as it is oI its monoSoly. Don’t do anythinJ to endanJer
our shiSSinJ SrivileJes, Paul.”
   “Do   you  think  they hide  because they’ve mutated  and don’t  look  …
human anymore?”
   “Who  knows?”  The Duke shruJJed. “It’s   a mystery we’re not  likely  to
solve. We’ve more immediate Sroblems—amonJ them: you.”
   “Me?”
   “Your  mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may
have Mentat caSabilities.”
   Paul stared at his Iather, unable to sSeak Ior a moment, then: “A Mentat?
Me? But I….”
   “Hawat  aJrees, Son. It’s true.”
   “But  I thouJht Mentat traininJ  had to start durinJ inIancy and the subMect
couldn’t be told because it miJht inhibit  the early….”  He broke oII,  all his
Sast circumstances cominJ to Iocus in one IlashinJ comSutation. “I see,” he
said.
   “A   day comes,” the Duke  said, “when  the Sotential Mentat must  learn
what’s beinJ done. It  may  no lonJer  be done to him.  The  Mentat has to
share in the choice oI  whether to continue or  abandon the traininJ. Some
can continue; some are incaSable oI it. Only  the Sotential Mentat can tell
this Ior sure about himselI.”
   Paul rubbed his chin. All  the sSecial traininJ Irom Hawat and his mother
—the  mnemonics, the  IocusinJ   oI  awareness, the  muscle control   and
sharSeninJ oI sensitivities, the study oI lanJuaJes and nuances oI voices—
all oI it clicked into a new kind oI understandinJ in his mind.
   “You’ll   be  the Duke  someday, Son,” his Iather  said. “A   Mentat Duke
would be Iormidable indeed. Can you decide now … or do you  need more
time?”
   There was no hesitation in his answer. “I’ll Jo on with the traininJ.”
   “Formidable  indeed,” the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the Sroud smile
on his  Iather’s Iace. The  smile shocked Paul:  it  had a skull  look  on the
Duke’s narrow Ieatures. Paul closed his eyes, IeelinJ  the terrible  SurSose
reawaken within  him.   Perhaps being  a  Mentat  is  terrible   purpose, he
thouJht.
   But even as he Iocused on this thouJht, his new awareness denied it.

        With the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant- legends
        through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known
        universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G. personnel has long been
        appreciated, but never have we seen a condition- ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person
        and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted
        labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia
        propheticus. And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica’s latent abilities were
        grossly underestimated.
        —from “Analysis: The Arrakeen Crisis” by the Princess Irulan (priYate circulation: B.G. file
                                                                                                         number AR-81088587)



 
  ALL  AROUND     the  Lady   Jessica—Siled    in   corners   oI  the  Arrakeen    Jreat
hall,  mounded   in  the oSen  sSaces—stood   the SackaJed   IreiJht   oI  their  lives:
bo[es,   trunks,    cartons,   cases—some   Sartly    unSacked.   She  could   hear   the
carJo  handlers  Irom   the  Guild   shuttle  deSositinJ   another   load  in  the entry.
    Jessica  stood  in  the  center  oI  the  hall.   She moved   in  a slow   turn,  lookinJ
uS   and   around     at   shadowed    carvinJs,      crannies    and    deeSly    recessed
windows.    This   Jiant   anachronism    oI  a  room   reminded    her  oI   the  Sisters’
Hall   at her   Bene  Gesserit   school.   But   at  the  school   the  eIIect   had  been  oI
warmth.   Here,  all  was  bleak  stone.
    Some   architect    had  reached    Iar  back   into    history    Ior   these  buttressed
walls  and  dark   hanJinJs,   she  thouJht.   The   arched  ceilinJ    stood  two   stories
above  her   with   Jreat   crossbeams    she  Ielt   sure  had   been  shiSSed   here  to
Arrakis   across  sSace at  monstrous   cost.  No  Slanet  oI  this   system  Jrew   trees
to make  such  beams—unless   the  beams  were  imitation    wood.
    She thouJht    not.
    This   had  been  the  Jovernment     mansion   in  the   days  oI  the  Old   EmSire.
Costs  had been  oI  less  imSortance    then.  It  had  been beIore   the  Harkonnens
and their   new  meJaloSolis    oI  CarthaJ—a    cheaS and  brassy  Slace  some  two
hundred   kilometers    northeast   across  the  Broken   Land.   Leto   had  been  wise
to choose   this  Slace  Ior  his  seat oI   Jovernment.    The  name,  Arrakeen,    had a
Jood   sound,   Iilled    with    tradition.    And    this   was  a  smaller    city,   easier   to
sterilize   and deIend.
    AJain   there  came  the  clatter  oI  bo[es   beinJ   unloaded   in the  entry.  Jessica
siJhed.

61
   AJainst  a  carton to  her riJht   stood the SaintinJ  oI  the Duke’s  Iather.
WraSSinJ twine hunJ Irom it like  a Irayed decoration. A Siece oI the twine
was still  clutched in  Jessica’s leIt  hand. Beside the SaintinJ  lay  a black
bull’s head mounted on a Solished board. The head was a dark island in a
sea oI wadded SaSer. Its SlaTue lay Ilat on the Iloor,  and the bull’s shiny
muzzle Sointed at the ceilinJ  as thouJh the beast were ready to  bellow a
challenJe into this echoinJ room.
   Jessica wondered what comSulsion had brouJht her to uncover those two
thinJs Iirst—the   head and the  SaintinJ. She knew  there  was somethinJ
symbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke’s buyers had taken
her Irom the school had she Ielt this IriJhtened and unsure oI herselI.
   The head and the Sicture.
   They heiJhtened her IeelinJs oI conIusion. She shuddered, Jlanced at the
slit windows  hiJh overhead. It was still  early  aIternoon here, and in these
latitudes the sky  looked black  and cold—so much  darker than the warm
blue oI Caladan. A SanJ oI homesickness throbbed throuJh her.
   So far away, Caladan.
   “Here  we are!”
   The voice was Duke Leto’s.
   She whirled, saw him stridinJ  Irom the arched SassaJe to the dininJ hall.
His  black workinJ   uniIorm  with   red  armorial  hawk crest  at  the breast
looked dusty and rumSled.
   “I  thouJht you miJht have lost yourselI in this hideous Slace,” he said.
   “It  is  a cold house,” she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin
that made her think oI  olive Jroves and Jolden sun on  blue waters. There
was woodsmoke in the Jray oI  his eyes, but the Iace was Sredatory: thin,
Iull oI sharS anJles and Slanes.
   A  sudden Iear oI him tiJhtened her breast. He had become such a savaJe,
drivinJ Serson since the decision to bow to the EmSeror’s command.
   “The  whole city Ieels cold,” she said.
   “It’s   a dirty,  dusty little   Jarrison town,”  he  aJreed. “But  we’ll  chanJe
that.”  He  looked   around the  hall.   “These  are  Sublic  rooms  Ior   state
occasions. I’ve Must Jlanced at some oI the Iamily aSartments in the south
winJ. They’re  much nicer.”  He steSSed closer, touched her arm, admirinJ
her stateliness.
   And  aJain, he  wondered at her unknown  ancestry—a reneJade House,
SerhaSs? Some black-barred royalty?  She  looked  more  reJal  than  the

62
EmSeror’s own blood.
   Under  the  Sressure oI  his stare,  she turned  halI  away, e[SosinJ  her
SroIile. And he realized there was no sinJle and Srecise thinJ that brouJht
her beauty to  Iocus. The Iace was  oval under a  caS oI hair  the color  oI
Solished bronze. Her eyes were set wide, as Jreen and clear as the morninJ
skies oI Caladan. The nose was small, the mouth wide and Jenerous. Her
IiJure was Jood but scant: tall and with its curves Jone to slimness.
   He remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so
his  buyers had  told  him.  But   that descriStion  oversimSliIied.  She  had
brouJht a reJal beauty back into  the Atreides line.  He was Jlad  that Paul
Iavored her.
   “Where’s Paul?” he asked.
   “SomeSlace around the house takinJ his lessons with Yueh.”
   “Probably  in  the south winJ,”  he said. “I  thouJht I  heard Yueh’s voice,
but I  couldn’t  take time  to look.”  He  Jlanced down  at her, hesitatinJ. “I
came here only to hanJ the key oI Caladan Castle in the dininJ hall.”
   She cauJht her breath, stoSSed the imSulse to reach out to him. HanJinJ
the key—there was Iinality in that action. But this was not the time or Slace
Ior comIortinJ. “I  saw our banner over the house as we came in,” she said.
   He Jlanced at the SaintinJ oI his Iather. “Where  were you JoinJ to hanJ
that?”
   “Somewhere in here.”
   “No.”   The word ranJ Ilat  and Iinal, tellinJ  her she could use trickery  to
Sersuade, but oSen arJument was useless. Still, she had to try, even iI the
Jesture served only to remind herselI that she would not trick him.
   “My  Lord,”  she said, “iI you’d only….”
   “The  answer remains no. I indulJe you shameIully in most thinJs, not in
this. I’ve Must come Irom the dininJ hall where there are—”
   “My  Lord!  Please.”
   “The   choice is  between your  diJestion  and my  ancestral diJnity,  my
dear,” he said. “They will hanJ in the dininJ hall.”
   She siJhed. “Yes, my Lord.”
   “You   may  resume your   custom oI   dininJ  in   your  rooms  whenever
Sossible. I   shall  e[Sect  you  at   your  SroSer Sosition  only   on  Iormal
occasions.”
   “Thank  you, my Lord.”

63
   “And   don’t  Jo  all  cold  and  Iormal  on me!  Be  thankIul  that  I  never
married you, my dear. Then it’d  be your duty to Moin me at table Ior every
meal.”
   She held her Iace immobile, nodded.
   “Hawat  already has our own  Soison snooSer over the dininJ table,”  he
said. “There’s a Sortable in your room.”
   “You  anticiSated this … disaJreement,” she said.
   “My   dear, I think  also oI  your comIort.  I’ve  enJaJed servants. They’re
locals, but Hawat  has cleared them—they’re Fremen all. They’ll   do until
our own SeoSle can be released Irom their other duties.”
   “Can anyone Irom this Slace be truly saIe?”
   “Anyone  who  hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keeS the head
housekeeSer: the Shadout MaSes.”
   “Shadout,”  Jessica said. “A Fremen title?”
   “I’m    told   it  means  ‘well-diSSer,’   a  meaninJ  with   rather  imSortant
overtones here. She may not strike you as a servant tySe, althouJh Hawat
sSeaks hiJhly oI her on the basis oI Duncan’s reSort. They’re convinced she
wants to serve—sSeciIically that she wants to serve you.”
   “Me?”
   “The  Fremen have learned that you’re  Bene Gesserit,” he said. “There
are leJends here about the Bene Gesserit.”
   The Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thouJht. No place escapes them.
   “Does  this mean Duncan was successIul?” she asked. “Will the Fremen
be our allies?”
   “There’s nothinJ  deIinite,” he said. “They wish to observe us Ior a while,
Duncan believes. They did, however, Sromise to stoS raidinJ our outlyinJ
villaJes durinJ  a truce Seriod. That’s a more imSortant Jain  than it miJht
seem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deeS thorn in the Harkonnen side,
that the e[tent oI  their ravaJes was a careIully Juarded secret. It wouldn’t
have helSed Ior the EmSeror to learn the ineIIectiveness oI the Harkonnen
military.”
   “A   Fremen housekeeSer,” Jessica mused, returninJ to the subMect oI the
Shadout MaSes. “She’ll have the all-blue eyes.”
   “Don’t  let  the aSSearance oI these SeoSle deceive you,” he said. “There’s
a deeS strenJth and healthy vitality in them. I think they’ll be everythinJ we
need.”
   “It’s  a danJerous Jamble,” she said.

64
   “Let’s  not Jo into that aJain,” he said.
   She Iorced  a smile.  “We  are committed,  no doubt  oI  that.”  She went
throuJh the Tuick  reJimen oI  calmness—the two deeS breaths, the ritual
thouJht, then:  “When  I  assiJn rooms, is  there anythinJ  sSecial I should
reserve Ior you?”
   “You  must teach me someday how you do that,”  he said, “the way  you
thrust your worries  aside and turn to Sractical matters. It  must be a Bene
Gesserit thinJ.”
   “It’s  a Iemale thinJ,” she said.
   He smiled. “Well,  assiJnment oI rooms: make certain I have larJe oIIice
sSace ne[t to my sleeSinJ Tuarters. There’ll be more SaSer work here than
on Caladan. A Juard  room, oI  course. That should cover it.  Don’t  worry
about security oI the house. Hawat’s men have been over it in deSth.”
   “I’m   sure they have.”
   He Jlanced at his wristwatch. “And  you miJht see that all our timeSieces
are adMusted Ior Arrakeen local. I’ve assiJned a tech to take care oI it. He’ll
be alonJ Sresently.” He brushed a strand oI her hair back Irom her Iorehead.
“I must return to the landinJ Iield now. The second shuttle’s due any minute
with my staII reserves.”
   “Couldn’t  Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired.”
   “The   Jood ThuIir   is  even busier  than  I  am. You  know  this  Slanet’s
inIested with Harkonnen intriJues. Besides, I must try  SersuadinJ some oI
the trained sSice hunters aJainst leavinJ. They have the oStion, you know,
with  the  chanJe  oI  IieI—and   this  SlanetoloJist  the  EmSeror  and  the
Landsraad installed  as  JudJe  oI  the  ChanJe  cannot  be  bouJht.  He’s
allowinJ the oSt. About eiJht hundred trained hands e[Sect to Jo out on the
sSice shuttle and there’s a Guild carJo shiS standinJ by.”
   “My  Lord….”  She broke oII, hesitatinJ.
   “Yes?”
   He will  not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us,
she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.
   “At  what time will  you be expecting dinner?” she asked.
   That’s not  what she was going to say, he thought Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica,
would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place
—alone, the two of us, without a care.
   “I’ll   eat in the oIIicers’ mess at the Iield,” he said. “Don’t e[Sect me until
very late. And  …  ah, I’ll   be sendinJ a  Juardcar Ior  Paul. I  want him  to

65
attend our strateJy conIerence.”
   He  cleared his  throat  as thouJh  to say  somethinJ else,  then, without
warninJ, turned and strode out, headed Ior the entry where she could hear
more  bo[es   beinJ   deSosited.  His   voice   sounded  once  Irom   there,
commandinJ and disdainIul, the way he always sSoke to servants when he
was in  a  hurry:  “The  Lady  Jessica’s in  the  Great  Hall.  Join  her there
immediately.”
   The outer door slammed.
   Jessica turned away, Iaced the SaintinJ oI Leto’s Iather. It had been done
by the  Iamed artist,  Albe,  durinJ  the Old  Duke’s middle  years. He  was
Sortrayed in matador costume with a maJenta caSe IlunJ over his leIt arm.
The Iace looked younJ,  hardly older  than Leto’s now, and  with the  same
hawk Ieatures, the  same Jray stare. She clenched  her Iists  at her  sides,
Jlared at the SaintinJ.
   “Damn  you! Damn you! Damn you!” she whisSered.
   “What  are your orders, Noble Born?”
   It  was a woman’s voice, thin and strinJy.
   Jessica whirled,   stared down  at  a  knobby,  Jray-haired  woman  in  a
shaSeless sack dress oI bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled
and desiccated as any member oI the mob that had Jreeted them alonJ the
way Irom the landinJ Iield  that morninJ. Every native she had seen on this
Slanet, Jessica thouJht, looked Srune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had
said they were stronJ and vital.  And  there were the eyes, oI course—that
wash oI  deeSest, darkest blue without  any white—secretive, mysterious.
Jessica Iorced herselI not to stare.
   The  woman  Jave a  stiII-necked  nod, said:  “I   am called  the Shadout
MaSes, Noble Born. What are your orders?”
   “You  may reIer to me as ‘my Lady,’  ”  Jessica said. “I’m not noble born.
I’m the bound concubine oI the Duke Leto.”
   AJain  that stranJe nod, and the woman Seered uSward at Jessica with a
sly TuestioninJ. “There’s a wiIe, then?”
   “There   is  not,  nor  has  there  ever  been. I   am  the  Duke’s  only  …
comSanion, the mother oI his heir-desiJnate.”
   Even  as she sSoke, Jessica lauJhed inwardly  at  the Sride  behind her
words. What  was  it  St. Augustine  said?  she asked herselI.  “The   mind
commands the  body  and  it   obeys. The  mind  orders  itself   and  meets

66
resistance. ” Yes—I am meeting more resistance lately. I could use a Tuiet
retreat by myself.
   A  weird  cry sounded Irom  the road outside the house. It was reSeated:
“Soo-soo-Sook!  Soo-soo-Sook!”   Then:   “Ikhut-eiJh!    Ikhut-eiJh!”    And
aJain: “Soo-soo-Sook!”
   “What   is that?”  Jessica asked. “I  heard  it  several times  as we  drove
throuJh the streets this morninJ.”
   “Only  a water-seller, my Lady. But you’ve no need to interest yourselI in
such as they. The cistern here holds IiIty thousand liters and it’s always keSt
Iull.”  She Jlanced down at  her dress. “Why, you  know, my  Lady, I  don’t
even have to  wear  my  stillsuit  here?”  She cackled. “And   me  not even
dead!”
   Jessica hesitated, wantinJ to Tuestion this Fremen woman, needinJ data
to Juide  her. But brinJinJ  order  oI  the conIusion in  the castle was more
imSerative. Still, she Iound  the thouJht unsettlinJ  that water was a maMor
mark oI wealth here.
   “My   husband told me oI your title, Shadout,” Jessica said. “I recoJnized
the word. It’s a very ancient word.”
   “You  know the ancient tonJues then?” MaSes asked, and she waited with
an odd intensity.
   “TonJues are the Bene Gesserit’s Iirst learninJ,” Jessica said. “I know the
Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the huntinJ lanJuaJes.”
   MaSes nodded. “Just as the leJend says.”
   And   Jessica wondered:  Why do   Iplayout  this  sham?  But  the  Bene
Gesserit ways were devious and comSellinJ.
   “I  know the Dark ThinJs and the ways oI the Great Mother,” Jessica said.
She read the more obvious siJns in MaSes’ actions and aSSearance, the Setit
betrayals. “Miseces SreMia,” she said in the Chakobsa tonJue. “Andral t’re
Sera! Trada cik buscakri miseces Serakri—”
   MaSes took a backward steS, aSSeared Soised to Ilee.
   “I   know   many  thinJs,”  Jessica said.  “I   know   that  you  have  borne
children, that you  have lost loved ones, that you  have hidden in  Iear and
that you have done violence and will  yet do  more violence. I  know many
thinJs.”
   In  a low voice, MaSes said: “I meant no oIIense, my Lady.”
   “You  sSeak oI the leJend and seek answers,” Jessica said. “Beware the
answers you may  Iind.  I  know  you  came SreSared Ior  violence with   a

67
weaSon in your bodice.”
   “My  Lady, I….”
   “There’s  a remote Sossibility  you could  draw my  liIe’s  blood,”  Jessica
said, “but in so doinJ  you’d brinJ  down more ruin  than your wildest Iears
could imaJine. There are worse thinJs than dyinJ, you know—even Ior  an
entire SeoSle.”
   “My   Lady!”   MaSes Sleaded. She aSSeared about to Iall to her  knees.
“The weaSon was sent as a JiIt to you should you Srove to be the One.”
   “And  as the means oI my death should I Srove otherwise,” Jessica said.
She waited in the seeminJ rela[ation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so
terriIyinJ in  combat.
   Now we see which way the decision tips, she thouJht.
   Slowly,  MaSes reached into the  neck oI  her dress, brouJht out  a dark
sheath. A black handle with deeS IinJer ridJes Srotruded Irom it. She took
sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew  a milk-white  blade,
held it uS. The blade seemed to shine and Jlitter with a liJht  oI its  own. It
was  double-edJed like   a  kindMal and  the   blade  was  SerhaSs twenty
centimeters lonJ.
   “Do  you know this, my Lady?” MaSes asked.
   It  could only be one thinJ, Jessica knew, the Iabled cryskniIe oI Arrakis,
the blade that had never been taken oII the Slanet, and was known only by
rumor and wild JossiS.
   “It’s  a cryskniIe,” she said.
   “Say it  not liJhtly,”  MaSes said. “Do you know its meaninJ?”
   And  Jessica thouJht:  There was an  edge to  that  Tuestion. Here’s the
reason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one Tuestion. My
answer could precipitate violence  or …  what? She seeks an answer from
me: the  meaning of  a  knife.  She’s called the  Shadout in  the  Chakobsa
tongue. Knife, that’s “Death  Maker”   in Chakobsa. She’s getting restive. I
must answer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer.
   Jessica said: “It’s a maker—”
   “EiJhe-e-e-e-e-e!”   MaSes wailed.  It   was a  sound  oI  both  JrieI   and
elation. She  trembled so  hard  the kniIe   blade sent  JlitterinJ   shards oI
reIlection shootinJ around the room.
   Jessica waited, Soised. She had intended to say the kniIe was a maker of
death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all

68
the deeS traininJ  oI  alertness that e[Sosed  meaninJ in  the  most casual
muscle twitch.
   The key word was … maker.
   Maker? Maker.
   Still,  MaSes held the kniIe as thouJh ready to use it.
   Jessica said: “Did  you think  that I,  knowinJ  the mysteries oI the  Great
Mother, would not know the Maker?”
   MaSes lowered the kniIe. “My   Lady, when one has lived with SroShecy
Ior so lonJ, the moment oI revelation is a shock.”
   Jessica thouJht  about the  SroShecy—the Shari-a and all  the  SanoSlia
SroSheticus, a Bene Gesserit oI the  Missionaria Protectiva  droSSed here
lonJ centuries aJo—lonJ dead, no doubt, but her SurSose accomSlished: the
Srotective leJends imSlanted in  these SeoSle aJainst the day  oI  a Bene
Gesserit’s need.
   Well, that day had come.
   MaSes returned kniIe to sheath, said: “This is an unIi[ed blade, my Lady.
KeeS it  near you.  More  than a  week away  Irom  Ilesh  and it  beJins  to
disinteJrate. It’s yours, a tooth oI shai-hulud, Ior as lonJ as you live.”
   Jessica reached out her  riJht  hand,  risked a  Jamble: “MaSes,  you’ve
sheathed that blade unblooded.”
   With  a JasS, MaSes droSSed the sheathed kniIe into Jessica’s hand, tore
oSen the brown bodice, wailinJ: “Take the water oI my liIe!”
   Jessica withdrew the blade Irom its sheath. How it Jlittered! She directed
the Soint toward MaSes, saw a Iear Jreater than death-Sanic come over the
woman. Poison in  the point?  Jessica wondered. She tiSSed uS the Soint,
drew a  delicate scratch with  the  blade’s edJe above  MaSes’ leIt  breast.
There was  a  thick  wellinJ   oI   blood  that  stoSSed almost immediately.
Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica thouJht. A moisture-conserving mutation?
   She sheathed the blade, said: “Button your dress, MaSes.”
   MaSes obeyed,  tremblinJ.  The  eyes without  whites  stared at  Jessica.
“You are ours,” she muttered. “You are the One.”
   There  came another sound oI   unloadinJ in  the  entry. SwiItly,   MaSes
Jrabbed the sheathed kniIe, concealed it in Jessica’s bodice. “Who sees that
kniIe must be cleansed or slain!” she snarled. “You know that, my Lady!”
   I  know it now, Jessica thouJht.
   The carJo handlers leIt without intrudinJ on the Great Hall.

69
   MaSes  comSosed herselI,  said:  “The   uncleansed who  have  seen  a
cryskniIe may not leave Arrakis alive.  Never IorJet that, my Lady.  You’ve
been entrusted with a cryskniIe.”  She took a deeS breath. “Now the thinJ
must take its course. It cannot be hurried.” She Jlanced at the stacked bo[es
and Siled Joods around them. “And there’s work aSlenty to while the time
Ior us here.”
   Jessica hesitated. “The thing must take its course.”  That was a  sSeciIic
catchShrase Irom the Missionaria Protectiva’s stock  oI incantations—The
coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.
   But I’m  not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thouJht. And then: Great Mother!
They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!
   In  matter-oI-Iact tones, MaSes said: “What’ll   you be wantinJ  me to do
Iirst, my Lady?”
   Instinct  warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: “The SaintinJ
oI the Old Duke over there, it must be hunJ on one side oI the dininJ  hall.
The bull’s head must Jo on the wall oSSosite the SaintinJ.”
   MaSes crossed to the bull’s head. “What a Jreat beast it must have been
to carry such a head,” she said. She stooSed. “I’ll have to be cleaninJ this
Iirst, won’t I,  my Lady?”
   “No.”
   “But  there’s dirt caked on its horns.”
   “That’s  not  dirt,  MaSes. That’s the  blood oI  our  Duke’s Iather. Those
horns were sSrayed with a transSarent Ii[ative within hours aIter this beast
killed the Old Duke.”
   MaSes stood uS. “Ah, now!” she said.
   “It’s  Must blood,” Jessica said. “Old blood at that. Get some helS hanJinJ
these now. The beastly thinJs are heavy.”
   “Did  you think  the blood bothered me?” MaSes asked. “I’m oI the desert
and I’ve seen blood aSlenty.”
   “I  … see that you have,” Jessica said.
   “And   some oI  it my  own,”  MaSes said. “More’n   you  drew with  your
Suny scratch.”
   “You’d  rather I’d cut deeSer?”
   “Ah,  no!  The body’s water is scant enouJh ‘thout JushinJ a wasteIul lot
oI it into the air. You did the thinJ riJht.”
   And    Jessica,  notinJ   the   words   and   manner,  cauJht   the   deeSer
imSlications in  the Shrase, “the body’s  water.” AJain  she Ielt  a sense oI

70
oSSression at the imSortance oI water on Arrakis.
   “On  which side oI the dininJ hall shall I hanJ which one oI these Sretties,
my Lady?” MaSes asked.
   Ever the practical  one, this Mapes, Jessica thouJht. She said: “Use your
own MudJment, MaSes. It makes no real diIIerence.”
   “As  you  say, my Lady.”  MaSes stooSed, beJan clearinJ wraSSinJs and
twine Irom the head. “Killed an old duke, did you?” she crooned.
   “Shall  I summon a handler to helS you?” Jessica asked.
   “I’ll   manaJe, my Lady.”
   Yes, she’ll   manage, Jessica thouJht.  There’s that  about  this  Fremen
creature: the drive to manage.
   Jessica Ielt the cold sheath oI the cryskniIe  beneath her bodice, thouJht
oI the lonJ  chain oI  Bene Gesserit scheminJ that had IorJed another link
here. Because oI that scheminJ, she had survived a deadly crisis. “It cannot
be hurried,” MaSes had said. Yet there was a temSo oI headlonJ rushinJ to
this Slace that Iilled Jessica with IorebodinJ. And not all the SreSarations oI
the  Missionaria  Protectiva   nor  Hawat’s   susSicious insSection  oI   this
castellated Sile oI rocks could disSel the IeelinJ.
   “When   you’ve   Iinished  hanJinJ   those, start  unSackinJ  the  bo[es,”
Jessica said. “One oI the carJo men at the entry has all the keys and knows
where thinJs should Jo. Get the keys and the list Irom him. II there are any
Tuestions I’ll be in the south winJ.”
   “As  you will,  my Lady,” MaSes said.
   Jessica turned away, thinkinJ: Hawat may have passed this residency as
safe, but there’s something wrong about the place. I can feel it.
   An  urJent need to see her son JriSSed Jessica. She beJan walkinJ toward
the arched doorway  that led  into  the SassaJe to the dininJ  hall  and the
Iamily winJs. Faster and Iaster she walked until she was almost runninJ.
   Behind her, MaSes Saused in clearinJ the wraSSinJs Irom the bull’s head,
looked at the retreatinJ back. “She’s the One all riJht,” she muttered. “Poor
thinJ.”

71
        “Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!” goes the refrain. “A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!”
                                             —from“A Child’s History of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  THE DOOR  stood  aMar, and Jessica steSSed throuJh  it  into   a room  with
yellow  walls.  To her leIt  stretched  a low settee oI  black  hide and two  emSty
bookcases, a hanJinJ waterIlask   with  dust on its  bulJinJ  sides. To her  riJht,
bracketinJ  another door, stood  more emSty bookcases, a desk  Irom Caladan
and three chairs.  At  the windows   directly   ahead oI her  stood Dr.  Yueh,  his
back to her, his attention  Ii[ed   uSon the outside world.
    Jessica took another silent  steS into the room.
    She saw  that  Yueh’s  coat  was  wrinkled,   a  white   smudJe  near the  leIt
elbow  as thouJh he  had leaned aJainst  chalk.  He looked,  Irom  behind,  like
a Ileshless  stick  IiJure  in  overlarJe   black  clothinJ,   a caricature  Soised Ior
strinJy  movement   at  the direction   oI  a  SuSSet master. Only   the  sTuarish
block  oI  head with  lonJ  ebony  hair  cauJht  in  its silver   Suk School  rinJ   at
the  shoulder   seemed alive—turninJ     sliJhtly    to  Iollow    some  movement
outside.
    AJain,  she Jlanced  around  the  room,  seeinJ no  siJn  oI  her  son, but  the
closed door on  her riJht,  she knew,  let into  a small  bedroom Ior  which  Paul
had e[Sressed a likinJ.
    “Good  aIternoon,  Dr. Yueh,”  she said. “Where’s  Paul?”
    He nodded  as thouJh   to somethinJ   out the  window,   sSoke in  an absent
manner without   turninJ:   “Your  son  Jrew  tired,  Jessica. I  sent him  into  the
ne[t  room to  rest.”
    AbruStly,  he  stiIIened,  whirled   with  mustache IloSSinJ   over his  SurSled
liSs. “ForJive    me, my  Lady!   My  thouJhts   were  Iar  away …   I …   did  not
mean to be Iamiliar.”
    She smiled,   held  out her  riJht   hand.  For  a moment,   she was  aIraid  he
miJht  kneel. “WellinJton,    Slease.”
    “To use your  name like  that …  I….”
    “We’ve   known   each  other   si[   years,”   she  said.  “It’s    lonJ   Sast  time
Iormalities  should’ve  been droSSed between us—in  Srivate.”
    Yueh ventured  a thin  smile, thinkinJ:   I  believe it  has worked.  Now, she’ll
think  anything  unusual  in  my  manner  is due  to embarrassment.   She’ll  not

72
look for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.
   “I’m   aIraid I was woolJatherinJ,” he said. “Whenever I … Ieel esSecially
sorry Ior you, I’m aIraid I think  oI you as … well, Jessica.”
   “Sorry  Ior me? Whatever Ior?”
   Yueh shruJJed. LonJ aJo, he had realized Jessica was not JiIted with the
Iull  Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always  used the truth with
Jessica whenever Sossible. It was saIest.
   “You’ve   seen this Slace, my …  Jessica.” He  stumbled over the name,
SlunJed  ahead:  “So   barren  aIter   Caladan.  And    the  SeoSle!  Those
townswomen we Sassed on the way here wailinJ  beneath their veils. The
way they looked at us.”
   She  Iolded  her  arms  across her  breast, huJJinJ  herselI,  IeelinJ   the
cryskniIe there, a blade Jround Irom a sandworm’s tooth, iI the reSorts were
riJht.  “It’s   Must that we’re  stranJe  to  them—diIIerent  SeoSle, diIIerent
customs. They’ve known only  the Harkonnens.” She looked  Sast him out
the windows. “What were you starinJ at out there?”
   He turned back to the window. “The SeoSle.”
   Jessica crossed to his side, looked to the leIt toward the Iront oI the house
where Yueh’s attention was Iocused. A line oI twenty Salm trees Jrew there,
the Jround  beneath them sweSt clean, barren. A   screen Ience seSarated
them Irom the road uSon which robed SeoSle were SassinJ. Jessica detected
a Iaint shimmerinJ in the air between her and the SeoSle—a house shield—
and went on to study the SassinJ thronJ, wonderinJ why Yueh Iound them
so absorbinJ.
   The  Sattern emerJed and she  Sut a  hand to  her cheek.  The way  the
SassinJ SeoSle looked at the Salm trees! She saw envy, some hate … even a
sense oI hoSe. Each Serson raked those trees with a Ii[ity oI e[Sression.
   “Do  you know what they’re thinkinJ?”  Yueh asked.
   “You  SroIess to read minds?” she asked.
   “Those minds,”  he said. “They look at those trees and they think: ‘There
are one hundred oI us.’ That’s what they think.”
   She turned a Suzzled Irown on him. “Why?”
   “Those  are date Salms,” he said. “One date Salm reTuires Iorty liters oI
water a day. A man reTuires but eiJht liters. A Salm, then, eTuals Iive men.
There are twenty Salms out there—one hundred men.”
   “But  some oI those SeoSle look at the trees hoSeIully.”
   “They  but hoSe some dates will Iall, e[ceSt it’s the wronJ season.”

73
   “We  look at this  Slace with too critical  an eye,” she said. “There’s hoSe
as well as danJer here. The sSice could make us rich. With a Iat  treasury,
we can make this world into whatever we wish.”
   And  she lauJhed silently  at herselI: Who am I  trying  to convince? The
lauJh broke throuJh  her restraints, emerJinJ brittle,  without  humor. “But
you can’t buy security,” she said.
   Yueh turned away  to hide his  Iace Irom her. If  only  it were possible to
hate these people instead  of  love them!  In  her  manner, in  many ways,
Jessica was like   his  Wanna.  Yet  that  thouJht  carried  its   own  riJors,
hardeninJ him  to his  SurSose. The ways oI  the Harkonnen cruelty  were
devious. Wanna miJht not be dead. He had to be certain.
   “Do  not worry Ior  us, WellinJton,” Jessica said. “The Sroblem’s ours, not
yours.”
   She thinks I  worry  for her!  He blinked back tears.  And I do,  of course.
But I must stand before that black Baron with  his deed accomplished, and
take my one  chance to  strike him  where he  is  weakest—in his gloating
moment!
   He siJhed.
   “Would  it disturb Paul iI I looked in on him?”  she asked.
   “Not  at all. I Jave him a sedative.”
   “He’s  takinJ the chanJe well?” she asked.
   “E[ceSt  Ior JettinJ  a bit overtired. He’s e[cited, but what IiIteen-year-old
wouldn’t be under these circumstances?” He crossed to the door, oSened it.
“He’s in here.”
   Jessica Iollowed, Seered into a shadowy room.
   Paul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a liJht cover, the other thrown
back over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom
oI shadows across Iace and blanket.
   Jessica stared at her son, seeinJ the oval shaSe oI Iace so like her own.
But  the  hair   was the   Duke’s—coal-colored  and  tousled.  LonJ  lashes
concealed the lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, IeelinJ her Iears retreat. She
was suddenly cauJht by the idea oI Jenetic traces in her son’s Ieatures—her
lines in  eyes and Iacial  outline,  but  sharS touches oI  the Iather  SeerinJ
throuJh that outline like maturity emerJinJ Irom childhood.
   She  thouJht  oI  the  boy’s  Ieatures as an  e[Tuisite  distillation   out  oI
random Satterns—endless Tueues oI haSSenstance meetinJ at this ne[us.
The thouJht made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her

74
arms, but she was inhibited by Yueh’s Sresence. She steSSed back, closed
the door soItly.
   Yueh  had returned  to  the window,  unable  to  bear watchinJ  the  way
Jessica stared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked
himselI. I  know as a doctor  there was no physical  reason against it. Was
there some Bene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a
different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.
   For  the Iirst time, he was cauJht uS in the thouJht that he miJht  be Sart
oI a Sattern more involuted and comSlicated than his mind could JrasS.
   Jessica stoSSed beside him, said: “What delicious abandon in the sleeS oI
a child.”
   He sSoke mechanically: “II only adults could rela[ like  that.”
   “Yes.”
   “Where do we lose it?” he murmured.
   She Jlanced at him, catchinJ the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul,
thinkinJ oI the new riJors in  his traininJ here, thinkinJ oI the diIIerences in
his liIe now—so very diIIerent Irom the liIe they once had Slanned Ior him.
   “We do, indeed, lose somethinJ,” she said.
   She Jlanced out to the riJht at a sloSe humSed with a wind-troubled Jray-
Jreen oI  bushes—dusty leaves and dry claw  branches. The too-dark sky
hunJ over the sloSe like a blot, and the milky liJht oI the Arrakeen sun Jave
the scene a silver cast—liJht like the cryskniIe concealed in her bodice.
   “The  sky’s so dark,” she said.
   “That’s  Sartly the lack oI moisture,” he said.
   “Water!”  she snaSSed. “Everywhere you turn here, you’re involved with
the lack oI water!”
   “It’s  the Srecious mystery oI Arrakis,” he said.
   “Why  is there so little oI it? There’s volcanic rock here. There’re a dozen
Sower sources I could name. There’s Solar ice. They say you can’t drill in
the desert—storms and sandtides destroy eTuiSment Iaster than it can be
installed, iI the worms don’t Jet you Iirst. They’ve  never Iound water traces
there, anyway. But the mystery, WellinJton,  the  real mystery is  the wells
that’ve been drilled  uS here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about
those?”
   “First  a trickle, then nothinJ,” he said.
   “But,   WellinJton,  that’s the mystery. The  water was there. It  dries uS.
And never aJain is there water. Yet another hole nearby Sroduces the same

75
result: a trickle that stoSs. Has no one ever been curious about this?”
   “It  is  curious,” he said. “You susSect some livinJ aJency? Wouldn’t that
have shown in core samSles?”
   “What  would  have shown? Alien Slant matter … or animal? Who could
recoJnize it?”   She  turned  back  to  the  sloSe.  “The  water   is  stoSSed.
SomethinJ SluJs it. That’s my susSicion.”
   “PerhaSs the reason’s known,” he said. “The Harkonnens sealed oII many
sources oI inIormation about Arrakis. PerhaSs there was reason to suSSress
this.”
   “What  reason?” she asked. “And then there’s the atmosSheric moisture.
Little enouJh oI it, certainly, but there’s some. It’s the maMor source oI water
here, cauJht in windtraSs and SreciSitators. Where does that come Irom?”
   “The  Solar caSs?”
   “Cold   air  takes uS  little  moisture,  WellinJton.  There  are thinJs  here
behind the Harkonnen veil that bear close investiJation, and not all oI those
thinJs are directly involved with the sSice.”
   “We  are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil,” he said. “PerhaSs we’ll….”
He broke oII,  notinJ  the sudden intense way she was lookinJ at  him. “Is
somethinJ wronJ?”
   “The   way you  say  ‘Harkonnen,’  ”  she said.  “Even  my  Duke’s  voice
doesn’t carry that weiJht oI  venom when he uses the hated name. I didn’t
know you had Sersonal reasons to hate them, WellinJton.”
   Great Mother!  he thouJht. I’ve  aroused her suspicions! Now I  must use
every trick my Wanna taught me. There’s only one solution: tell the truth as
far as I can.
   He  said: “You  didn’t  know that  my wiIe,  my  Wanna….” He shruJJed,
unable to sSeak Sast a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: “They….”
The words  would  not  come out.  He  Ielt  Sanic, closed  his eyes tiJhtly,
e[SeriencinJ the aJony in his  chest and little else until a hand touched his
arm Jently.  “ForJive  me,”  Jessica said. “I  did  not  mean to oSen an old
wound.” And  she thouJht: Those animals! His wife  was Bene Gesserit —
the signs are  all  over  him.  And it’s  obvious  the Harkonnens  killed  her.
Here’s another poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.
   “I  am sorry,”  he said. “I’m  unable to talk about it.”  He oSened his eyes,
JivinJ himselI uS to the internal awareness oI JrieI. That, at least, was truth.
   Jessica studied him,  seeinJ the uS-anJled cheeks, the  dark seTuins oI
almond eyes, the butter comSle[ion,  and strinJy mustache hanJinJ like  a

76
curved Irame  around SurSled liSs  and narrow  chin.  The  creases oI his
cheeks and Iorehead, she saw, were as much lines oI sorrow as oI aJe. A
deeS aIIection Ior him came over her.
   “WellinJton,   I’m  sorry we  brouJht you  into this  danJerous Slace,” she
said.
   “I  came willinJly,”  he said. And that, too, was true.
   “But  this whole Slanet’s a Harkonnen traS. You must know that.”
   “It  will  take more than a traS to catch the Duke Leto,” he said. And that,
too, was true.
   “PerhaSs I should be more conIident oI him,”  she said. “He is a brilliant
tactician.”
   “We’ve  been uSrooted,” he said. “That’s why we’re uneasy.”
   “And   how  easy it is  to  kill  the  uSrooted Slant,” she said.  “EsSecially
when you Sut it down in hostile soil.”
   “Are  we certain the soil’s hostile?”
   “There  were water riots when it was learned how many SeoSle the Duke
was addinJ  to  the SoSulation,”  she said. “They  stoSSed only  when the
SeoSle learned we were installinJ  new windtraSs and condensers to take
care oI the load.”
   “There  is only so much water to suSSort human liIe here,” he said. “The
SeoSle know iI more  come to drink  a limited  amount  oI water, the  Srice
Joes uS and the very  Soor die. But  the  Duke has solved this.  It  doesn’t
Iollow that the riots mean Sermanent hostility toward him.”
   “And   Juards,” she said. “Guards everywhere. And shields. You see the
blurrinJ  oI   them  everywhere you  look.   We  did  not  live   this  way  on
Caladan.”
   “Give  this Slanet a chance,” he said.
   But  Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window.  “I  can  smell
death in this Slace,” she said. “Hawat  sent advance aJents in here by the
battalion. Those Juards outside  are his men.  The carJo  handlers are his
men. There’ve   been une[Slained  withdrawals  oI   larJe  sums  Irom  the
treasury. The amounts mean only  one thinJ:  bribes in  hiJh  Slaces.” She
shook her head. “Where ThuIir Hawat Joes, death and deceit Iollow.”
   “You  maliJn him.”
   “MaliJn?  I  Sraise him. Death and deceit are our only hoSes now. I Must do
not Iool myselI about ThuIir’s methods.”

77
   “You  should  …  keeS busy,” he said. “Give   yourselI no  time  Ior  such
morbid—”
   “Busy!   What  is it  that  takes most  oI  my  time, WellinJton?  I  am  the
Duke’s secretary—so busy that each day I learn new thinJs to Iear … thinJs
even he doesn’t susSect I know.”  She comSressed her liSs, sSoke thinly:
“Sometimes I   wonder  how  much  my   Bene Gesserit  business traininJ
IiJured in his choice oI me.”
   “What  do you mean?” He Iound  himselI cauJht by the cynical  tone, the
bitterness that he had never seen her e[Sose.
   “Don’t   you think, WellinJton,”  she asked, “that a secretary bound to one
by love is so much saIer?”
   “That  is not a worthy thouJht, Jessica.”
   The rebuke came naturally to his liSs. There was no doubt how the Duke
Ielt about his  concubine. One had only  to watch  him  as he Iollowed  her
with his eyes.
   She siJhed. “You’re riJht. It’s  not worthy.”
   AJain,  she huJJed  herselI, SressinJ the sheathed cryskniIe aJainst her
Ilesh and thinkinJ oI the unIinished business it reSresented.
   “There’ll   be much  bloodshed soon,” she said. “The  Harkonnens won’t
rest until they’re dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot IorJet that
Leto is a cousin oI the royal blood—no matter what the distance—while the
Harkonnen titles came out oI  the CHOAM  Socketbook. But the Soison in
him, deeS in his mind, is the knowledJe that an Atreides had a Harkonnen
banished Ior cowardice aIter the Battle oI Corrin.”
   “The  old Ieud,”  Yueh muttered. And Ior a moment he Ielt  an acid touch
oI hate. The old  Ieud had  traSSed him in its  web, killed  his Wanna or—
worse—leIt her Ior Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their biddinJ.
The old Ieud had traSSed him and these SeoSle were Sart oI that Soisonous
thinJ. The  irony was that  such deadliness should come to Ilower here on
Arrakis, the one source in the universe oI melanJe, the SrolonJer oI liIe, the
Jiver oI health.
   “What  are you thinkinJ?” she asked.
   “I   am thinkinJ  that  the sSice brinJs  si[  hundred and  twenty thousand
solaris the decaJram on the oSen market riJht now. That is  wealth to buy
many thinJs.”
   “Does Jreed touch even you, WellinJton?”
   “Not  Jreed.”

78
   “What  then?”
   He shruJJed. “Futility.”  He Jlanced at her. “Can you remember your Iirst
taste oI sSice?”
   “It  tasted like cinnamon.”
   “But  never twice the same,” he said. “It’s like liIe—it  Sresents a diIIerent
Iace each time you take  it. Some hold  that the sSice Sroduces a learned-
Ilavor  reaction. The  body, learninJ  a thinJ  is  Jood  Ior  it,  interSrets the
Ilavor as Sleasurable—sliJhtly  euShoric. And, like  liIe,  never to  be truly
synthesized.”
   “I  think  it  would’ve  been wiser Ior us to Jo  reneJade, to take ourselves
beyond the ImSerial reach,” she said.
   He  saw that  she hadn’t  been listeninJ  to him,  Iocused on  her words,
wonderinJ: Yes—why didn’t she make him do this? She could make him do
virtually anything.
   He  sSoke Tuickly   because here was  truth  and  a  chanJe oI  subMect:
“Would you think it bold oI  me … Jessica, iI I asked a Sersonal Tuestion?”
   She  Sressed aJainst the  window  ledJe  in  an  une[Slainable  SanJ oI
disTuiet. “OI course not. You’re … my Iriend.”
   “Why  haven’t you made the Duke marry you?”
   She whirled, head uS, JlarinJ. “Made him marry me? But—”
   “I  should not have asked,” he said.
   “No.”  She shruJJed. “There’s Jood Solitical reason—as lonJ as my Duke
remains unmarried some oI the  Great Houses can still  hoSe Ior  alliance.
And….”  She  siJhed. “…   motivatinJ  SeoSle, IorcinJ  them to  your  will,
Jives you  a  cynical  attitude toward  humanity.  It  deJrades everythinJ  it
touches. II I made him do … this, then it would not be his doinJ.”
   “It’s   a thinJ  my Wanna miJht  have said,” he murmured. And  this, too,
was truth. He  Sut a hand to his  mouth, swallowinJ  convulsively.  He had
never been closer to sSeakinJ out, conIessinJ his secret role.
   Jessica sSoke, shatterinJ the moment. “Besides, WellinJton, the Duke is
really  two  men. One  oI  them I  love  very  much.  He’s  charminJ, witty,
considerate … tender—everythinJ a woman could desire. But the other man
is …  cold,  callous,  demandinJ, selIish—as harsh  and cruel  as a winter
wind. That’s the man shaSed by the Iather.” Her Iace contorted. “II only that
old man had died when my Duke was born!”
   In  the silence that came between them, a breeze Irom a ventilator could
be heard IinJerinJ the blinds.

79
   Presently, she took a  deeS breath, said, “Leto’s riJht—these rooms  are
nicer than the ones in the other sections oI the house.” She turned, sweeSinJ
the room with  her Jaze. “II  you’ll   e[cuse me, WellinJton,  I  want another
look throuJh this winJ beIore I assiJn Tuarters.”
   He  nodded. “OI  course.” And he thouJht:  If  only there were some way
not to do this thing that I must do.
   Jessica droSSed her arms, crossed to  the hall  door  and stood  there a
moment, hesitatinJ,  then let  herselI out.  All  the  time  we talked  he was
hiding  something,  holding   something back,  she  thouJht.  To  save  my
feelings, no doubt. He’s a  good man. AJain,  she hesitated, almost turned
back to conIront Yueh and draJ the hidden thinJ Irom him. But  that would
only shame him, frighten  him to  learn he’s so easily read. I  should place
more trust in my friends.

        Many have marked the speed with which Muad‘Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The
        Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that
        Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson
        of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not
        believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad‘Dib knew
        that every experience carries its lesson.
                                                    —from “The Humanity of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
P AUL  LAY   on  the  bed  IeiJninJ    sleeS.  It  had  been easy  to  Salm  Dr.  Yueh’s
sleeSinJ  tablet,   to  Sretend  to  swallow    it.  Paul  suSSressed  a lauJh.   Even   his
mother   had  believed    him   asleeS.  He  had   wanted   to  MumS uS and   ask  her
Sermission    to   Jo    e[SlorinJ     the    house,   but    had   realized    she   wouldn’t
aSSrove. ThinJs   were  too  unsettled   yet.  No.  This   way  was best.
    If  I  slip   out  without    asking   I  haven’t  disobeyed    orders.   And  Iwill    stay  in
the house  where  it’s  safe.
    He  heard   his  mother    and  Yueh   talkinJ    in  the   other  room.    Their   words
were   indistinct—somethinJ         about    the    sSice   …    the    Harkonnens.     The
conversation   rose  and Iell.
    Paul’s    attention     went   to    the   carved    headboard    oI   his    bed—a    Ialse
headboard   attached  to  the  wall   and  concealinJ    the  controls    Ior  this   room’s
Iunctions.    A  leaSinJ   Iish   had  been  shaSed  on   the  wood   with   thick   brown
waves  beneath  it.  He knew   iI  he Sushed  the  Iish’s  one  visible   eye  that would
turn   on   the  room’s    susSensor   lamSs.   One   oI   the   waves,    when   twisted,
controlled   ventilation.    Another    chanJed  the  temSerature.
    Quietly,    Paul  sat uS  in  bed.  A  tall   bookcase  stood   aJainst   the wall   to  his
leIt.  It  could   be swunJ   aside  to  reveal  a  closet  with   drawers   alonJ  one  side.
The  handle  on  the  door  into   the  hall  was  Satterned   on  an ornithoSter    thrust
bar.
    It  was  as thouJh  the  room  had  been  desiJned  to  entice  him.
    The  room  and  this  Slanet.
    He    thouJht    oI    the   Iilmbook      Yueh    had    shown    him—“Arrakis:        His
ImSerial     MaMesty’s   Desert    Botanical     TestinJ     Station.”     It    was    an   old
Iilmbook    Irom   beIore   discovery    oI  the  sSice.  Names   Ilitted    throuJh   Paul’s
mind,    each  with     its   Sicture   imSrinted     by   the   book’s    mnemonic     Sulse:
saguaro,   burro    bush,   date  palm,    sand  verbena,    evening   primrose,    barrel

81
cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush … kit  fox,  desert hawk,
kangaroo mouse….
   Names and Sictures, names and Sictures Irom man’s terranic Sast—and
many to be Iound now nowhere else in the universe e[ceSt here on Arrakis.
   So many new thinJs to learn about—the sSice.
   And  the sandworms.
   A   door  closed in  the  other  room. Paul  heard his  mother’s  IootsteSs
retreatinJ down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would Iind  somethinJ to read
and remain in the other room.
   Now  was the moment to Jo e[SlorinJ.
   Paul  sliSSed out oI the bed, headed Ior the  bookcase door that oSened
into  the closet.  He stoSSed at a  sound behind him,  turned.  The  carved
headboard oI the bed was IoldinJ  down onto the sSot where he had been
sleeSinJ. Paul Iroze, and immobility saved his liIe.
   From  behind the  headboard sliSSed a tiny hunter-seeker no more than
Iive centimeters lonJ. Paul recoJnized it at once—a common assassination
weaSon that every child oI royal blood learned about at an early aJe. It was
a raveninJ sliver oI  metal Juided by  some near-by hand and eye. It could
burrow into movinJ Ilesh and chew its way uS nerve channels to the nearest
vital orJan.
   The seeker liIted, swunJ sideways across the room and back.
   ThrouJh  Paul’s mind  Ilashed the  related knowledJe, the  hunter-seeker
limitations: Its  comSressed susSensor Iield distorted the room to reIlect his
tarJet, the oSerator would be relyinJ  on motion—anythinJ  that moved. A
shield could slow a hunter, Jive time to destroy it, but Paul had Sut aside his
shield on  the bed.  LasJuns would  knock  them  down, but  lasJuns were
e[Sensive and notoriously cranky  oI  maintenance—and there was always
the Seril oI e[Slosive Syrotechnics iI the laser beam intersected a hot shield.
The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.
   Now,  Paul held  himselI  in near catatonic  immobility,  knowinJ  he  had
only his wits to meet this threat.
   The hunter-seeker liIted another halI meter. It riSSled throuJh the slatted
liJht Irom the window blinds, back and Iorth, TuarterinJ the room.
   I  must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery
on the bottom. I must grip tightly.
   The thinJ  droSSed a halI meter, Tuartered to the leIt, circled back around
the bed. A Iaint humminJ could be heard Irom it.

82
   Who is operating that thing? Paul wondered. It has to be someone near. I
could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.
   The  hall  door  behind  Paul  creaked. A  raS  sounded there. The  door
oSened.
   The hunter-seeker arrowed Sast his head toward the motion.
   Paul’s  riJht   hand shot  out  and  down,  JriSSinJ  the  deadly  thinJ.  It
hummed and twisted  in  his hand,  but his  muscles were locked  on  it  in
desSeration. With a violent  turn and  thrust, he slammed the thinJ’s  nose
aJainst the metal doorSlate. He Ielt the crunch oI it as the nose eye smashed
and the seeker went dead in his hand.
   Still,  he held it—to be certain.
   Paul’s eyes came uS, met the oSen stare oI total blue Irom  the Shadout
MaSes.
   “Your  Iather  has sent Ior you,”  she said. “There are men in  the hall  to
escort you.”
   Paul nodded, his  eyes and awareness IocusinJ on this odd woman in a
sacklike dress oI   bondsman brown.  She was lookinJ   now  at  the thinJ
clutched in his hand.
   “I’ve  heard oI suchlike,” she said. “It would’ve killed  me, not so?”
   He had to swallow beIore he could sSeak. “I … was its tarJet.”
   “But  it was cominJ Ior me.”
   “Because you were movinJ.” And he wondered: Who is this creature?
   “Then  you saved my liIe,” she said.
   “I  saved both our lives.”
   “Seems like you could’ve let  it have me and made your own escaSe,” she
said.
   “Who  are you?” he asked.
   “The  Shadout MaSes, housekeeSer.”
   How  did you know where to Iind me?”
   “Your  mother told me. I met her at the stairs to the weirdinJ room  down
the hall.” She Sointed to her riJht. “Your Iather’s men are still waitinJ.”
   Those will  be Hawat’s men, he thought. We must find the operator of this
thing.
   “Go  to my Iather’s men,” he said. “Tell  them I’ve cauJht a hunter-seeker
in the house and they’re to  sSread out and Iind the oSerator. Tell them to
seal oII the  house and its Jrounds immediately.  They’ll  know  how to  Jo
about it. The oSerator’s sure to be a stranJer amonJ us.”

83
   And  he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn’t. The
seeker had been under control when she entered.
   “BeIore  I  do  your biddinJ,  manlinJ,”  MaSes said, “I   must cleanse the
way between us. You’ve Sut a water burden on me that I’m not sure I care
to suSSort. But we  Fremen Say our debts—be they black  debts or white
debts. And it’s known to us that you’ve a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we
cannot say, but we’re certain sure oI it. MayhaS there’s the hand Juided that
Ilesh-cutter.”
   Paul absorbed this in  silence: a traitor.  BeIore he could  sSeak, the odd
woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.
   He thouJht  to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him
she would resent it. She’d told him what she knew and now she was JoinJ
to do his  bidding. The  house would be swarminJ  with  Hawat’s men in  a
minute.
   His  mind went to other Sarts oI that stranJe conversation: weirding room.
He looked to  his  leIt  where she had Sointed. We Fremen. So that was a
Fremen. He Saused Ior the mnemonic blink that would store the Sattern oI
her Iace in his  memory-Srune-wrinkled Ieatures darkly browned, blue-on-
blue eyes without any  white in  them. He attached the label: The Shadout
Mapes.
   Still   JriSSinJ  the  shattered seeker, Paul  turned  back into   his  room,
scooSed uS his shield belt Irom the bed with his leIt hand, swunJ it around
his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the leIt.
   She’d  said his mother was someSlace down here—stairs … a weirding
room.

84
        What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you carefully on this Bene
        Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: “Any road followed precisely to its end leads
        precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it’s a mountain. From the top
        of the mountain, you can not see the mountain.”
                                           —from “Muad’Dib: Family Commentaries” by the Princess Irulan



 
A T THE   end  oI  the  south   winJ,   Jessica  Iound   a metal   stair   sSiralinJ   uS  to
an oval  door.  She  Jlanced  back  down   the hall,   aJain  uS at  the door.
    Oval?   she wondered.   What  an  odd  shape  for  a door   in  a house.
    ThrouJh    the   windows    beneath   the   sSiral   stair   she  could   see  the   Jreat
white   sun  oI   Arrakis    movinJ    on   toward   eveninJ.    LonJ    shadows   stabbed
down   the  hall.   She  returned   her   attention   to  the   stairs.  Harsh   sideliJhtinJ
Sicked  out  bits  oI  dried  earth  on the  oSen  metalwork   oI  the  steSs.
    Jessica  Sut a  hand on  the  rail,  beJan   to climb.    The  rail  Ielt  cold   under  her
slidinJ   Salm.  She  stoSSed at  the  door,  saw  it  had  no handle,   but  there  was  a
Iaint  deSression  on  the  surIace  oI  it  where  a handle  should   have  been.
    Surely  not  a palm   lock,  she told   herselI.  A  palm  lock   must  be keyed  to  one
individual’s    hand  shape  and  palm   lines.  But  it  looked   like   a Salm  lock.   And
there were  ways   to oSen  any  Salm lock—as    she had  learned  at school.
    Jessica  Jlanced    back   to  make   certain    she  was   unobserved,    Slaced  her
Salm  aJainst   the   deSression   in  the   door.  The   most   Jentle   oI   Sressures  to
distort   the  lines—a    turn   oI   the  wrist,    another   turn,   a  slidinJ    twist    oI  the
Salm across  the  surIace.
    She Ielt   the click.
    But   there  were   hurryinJ    IootsteSs   in   the  hall   beneath  her.  Jessica  liIted
her hand  Irom   the door,  turned,   saw  MaSes  come  to the  Ioot  oI  the  stairs.
    “There   are  men  in  the Jreat  hall   say they’ve    been  sent by  the  Duke  to  Jet
younJ   master  Paul,”    MaSes  said.  “They’ve     the  ducal   siJnet   and  the  Juard
has identiIied    them.”   She Jlanced   at the  door,  back  to  Jessica.
    A cautious   one,  this  Mapes,   Jessica thouJht.   That’s   a good  sign.
    “He’s    in  the  IiIth    room   Irom    this  end  oI   the  hall,   the   small   bedroom,”
Jessica said.   “II   you  have  trouble   wakinJ    him,   call  on  Dr.  Yueh  in  the  ne[t
room.  Paul  may  reTuire  a  wakeshot.”
    AJain,    MaSes  cast  a SiercinJ    stare  at the  oval   door,   and  Jessica  thouJht
she detected   loathinJ    in  the  e[Sression.   BeIore    Jessica  could  ask  about   the

85
door and what it  concealed, MaSes had turned away, hurryinJ back down
the hall.
   Hawat  certified this  place, Jessica thouJht. There can’t be anything too
terrible in here.
   She Sushed the door. It  swunJ inward  onto a small  room with  another
oval door oSSosite. The other door had a wheel handle.
   An air  lock! Jessica thouJht. She Jlanced down, saw a door SroS Iallen to
the Iloor  oI the little  room.  The SroS carried Hawat’s Sersonal mark. The
door was left  propped open, she thouJht. Someone probably knocked the
prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm
lock.
   She steSSed over the liS into the little room.
   Why an airlock  in a house? she asked herselI. And she thouJht suddenly
oI e[otic creatures sealed oII in sSecial climates.
   Special climate!
   That  would make  sense on Arrakis where even the driest  oI oII-Slanet
JrowinJ thinJs had to be irriJated.
   The door behind her beJan swinJinJ closed. She cauJht it and SroSSed it
oSen securely with the stick  Hawat had leIt.  AJain,  she Iaced the wheel-
locked inner door, seeinJ now a Iaint inscriStion etched in the metal above
the handle. She recoJnized Galach words, read:
   “O,  Man! Here is a lovely Sortion oI God’s Creation; then, stand beIore it
and learn to love the SerIection oI Thy SuSreme Friend.”
   Jessica Sut her weiJht  on  the wheel. It  turned  leIt  and the inner  door
oSened. A Jentle draIt Ieathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She Ielt chanJe
in the  air, a  richer taste. She swunJ  the door  wide,  looked throuJh  into
massed Jreenery with yellow sunliJht SourinJ across it.
   A yellow sun? she asked herselI. Then: Filter glass!
   She steSSed over the sill and the door swunJ closed behind.
   “A  wet-Slanet conservatory,” she breathed.
   Potted  Slants and low-Sruned trees stood  all  about. She recoJnized  a
mimosa, a IlowerinJ Tuince, a sondaJi, Jreen-blossomed Sleniscenta, Jreen
and white striSed akarso … roses….
   Even roses!
   She bent to breathe the IraJrance oI a Jiant Sink blossom, straiJhtened to
Seer around the room.
   Rhythmic  noise invaded her senses.

86
   She Sarted a MunJle overlaSSinJ oI leaves, looked throuJh to the center oI
the room. A low  Iountain stood there, small with Iluted  liSs. The rhythmic
noise was a SeelinJ, sSoolinJ arc  oI water  IallinJ  thud-a-JalloS onto  the
metal bowl.
   Jessica sent herselI throuJh  the Tuick sense-clearinJ reJimen, beJan a
methodical insSection oI the room’s Serimeter. It aSSeared to be about ten
meters sTuare. From its Slacement above the end oI the hall and Irom subtle
diIIerences in construction, she Juessed it had been added onto the rooI oI
this winJ ionJ aIter the oriJinal buildinJ’s  comSletion.
   She stoSSed at the south limits oI the room in Iront oI  the wide reach oI
Iilter Jlass, stared around. Every available sSace in the room was crowded
with  e[otic   wet-climate  Slants. SomethinJ  rustled in   the Jreenery.  She
tensed, then JlimSsed a simSle clock-set servok with SiSe and hose arms.
An arm liIted, sent out a Iine sSray oI damSness that misted her cheeks. The
arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a Iern tree.
   Water everywhere in  this room—on a Slanet where water was the most
Srecious Muice oI liIe. Water beinJ wasted so consSicuously that it shocked
her to inner stillness.
   She  Jlanced out  at  the Iilter-yellowed   sun. It   hunJ low   on a  MaJJed
horizon above cliIIs that Iormed Sart oI the immense rock uSliItinJ  known
as the Shield Wall.
   Filter  glass, she thought. To turn a  white sun into something softer and
more familiar. Who could  have built such a place?  Leto? It would  be like
him to surprise  me with  such a gift,  but there hasn’t been time. And  he’s
been busy with more serious problems.
   She recalled the reSort that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock
doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said
it was a deliberate statement oI Sower and wealth Ior this house to iJnore
such Srecautions, its  doors and  windows  beinJ  sealed only  aJainst the
omniSresent dust.
   But  this room embodied a statement Iar more siJniIicant than the lack oI
waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this Sleasure room used water
enouJh to suSSort a thousand Sersons on Arrakis—Sossibly more.
   Jessica moved alonJ the window, continuinJ to  stare into the room. The
move brouJht   into  view  a  metallic   surIace at  table  heiJht  beside  the
Iountain and she JlimSsed a white noteSad and stylus there Sartly concealed

87
by  an  overhanJinJ  Ian  leaI.  She  crossed to  the  table,  noted  Hawat’s
daysiJns on it, studied a messaJe written on the Sad:

                                      “TO   THE  LADY    JESSICA—

       May  this Slace Jive you  as much Sleasure as it has Jiven me. Please
       Sermit the room to convey a lesson we learned Irom the same teachers:
       the Sro[imity   oI  a desirable thinJ  temSts one to overindulJence. On
       that Sath lies danJer.
       My  kindest wishes,
       MARGOT  LADY  FENRING” 

   Jessica nodded, rememberinJ that  Leto had  reIerred to  the EmSeror’s
Iormer Sro[y  here as Count FenrinJ.  But the hidden  messaJe oI the note
demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inIorm her the
writer  was  another Bene  Gesserit. A  bitter   thouJht  touched Jessica in
SassinJ: The Count married his Lady.
   Even as this thouJht  Ilicked throuJh  her mind, she was bendinJ to seek
out the hidden messaJe. It had to be there. The visible note contained the
code Shrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by  a  School InMunction was
reTuired to Jive another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: “On
that Sath lies danJer.”
   Jessica Ielt  the  back oI  the  note,  rubbed the  surIace Ior  coded dots.
NothinJ. The edJe oI the Sad came under her seekinJ IinJers. NothinJ. She
reSlaced the Sad where she had Iound it, IeelinJ a sense oI urJency.
   Something in the position of the pad? she wondered.
   But  Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the Sad. She
looked at the leaI above the Sad. The leaI! She brushed a IinJer alonJ the
under surIace, alonJ the  edJe, alonJ the  stem. It  was there!  Her IinJers
detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a sinJle SassaJe:
   “Your  son and the Duke are in  immediate danJer. A bedroom has been
desiJned to  attract  your  son.  The H   loaded it   with  death  traSs to  be
discovered, leavinJ one that may escaSe detection.” Jessica Sut down the
urJe to run  back to Paul; the  Iull  messaJe had to be learned. Her IinJers
sSed over the dots: “I do not know the e[act nature oI the menace, but it has
somethinJ to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves deIection oI a
trusted comSanion or lieutenant. The H Slan to Jive you as JiIt to a minion.

88
To the  best oI  my  knowledJe,  this  conservatory is  saIe. ForJive  that  I
cannot tell more. My  sources are Iew as my Count is not in the Say oI the
H. In haste, MF.”
   Jessica thrust the leaI aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant,
the airlock door slammed oSen. Paul MumSed throuJh it, holdinJ somethinJ
in his riJht hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, Sushed
throuJh the leaves to her, Jlanced at the Iountain,  thrust his hand and the
thinJ it clutched under the IallinJ water.
   “Paul!”  She Jrabbed his shoulder, starinJ at the hand. “What is that?”
   He  sSoke casually, but she cauJht the eIIort  behind the tone: “Hunter-
seeker. CauJht it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to be sure.
Water should short it out.”
   “Immerse it!”  she commanded.
   He obeyed.
   Presently, she said: “Withdraw your hand. Leave the thinJ in the water.”
   He  brouJht out  his hand, shook water  Irom  it, starinJ  at the Tuiescent
metal in  the Iountain. Jessica broke oII  a Slant stem, Srodded the deadly
sliver.
   It  was dead.
   She droSSed the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the
room with a searchinJ intensity that she recoJnized—the B.G. Way.
   “This  Slace could conceal anythinJ,” he said.
   “I’ve  reason to believe it’s saIe,” she said.
   “My  room was suSSosed to be saIe, too. Hawat said—”
   “It  was a hunter-seeker,” she reminded him. “That means someone inside
the house to oSerate it.  Seeker control beams have a limited   ranJe. The
thinJ could’ve been sSirited in here aIter Hawat’s investiJation.”
   But  she thouJht oI  the messaJe oI the  leaI: “…   defection of a  trusted
companion or lieutenant. ” Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.
   “Hawat’s  men are searchinJ the house riJht now,” he said. “That seeker
almost Jot the old woman who came to wake me.”
   “The  Shadout MaSes,” Jessica said, rememberinJ the encounter at  the
stairs. “A summons Irom your Iather to—”
   “That  can wait,” Paul said. “Why do you think this room’s saIe?”
   She Sointed to the note, e[Slained about it.
   He rela[ed  sliJhtly.

89
   But  Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinkinJ: A hunter-seeker! Merciful
Mother! It took all her traininJ to Srevent a Iit oI hysterical tremblinJ.
   Paul  sSoke matter oI Iactly:  “It’s   the Harkonnens, oI  course. We shall
have to destroy them.”
   A   raSSinJ sounded at  the  airlock   door—the  code knock   oI  one  oI
Hawat’s corSs.
   “Come in,”  Paul called.
   The door  swunJ wide and a tall  man in Atreides uniIorm  with  a Hawat
insiJnia on his caS leaned into the room. “There you are, sir,” he said. “The
housekeeSer said you’d be here.” He Jlanced around the room. “We Iound a
cairn in the cellar and cauJht a man in it. He had a seeker console.”
   “I’ll   want to take Sart in the interroJation,” Jessica said.
   “Sorry,  my Lady. We messed him uS catchinJ him. He died.”
   “NothinJ  to identiIy  him?” she asked.
   “We’ve  Iound nothinJ yet, my Lady.”
   “Was he an Arrakeen native?” Paul asked.
   Jessica nodded at the astuteness oI the Tuestion.
   “He  has the  native look,”  the  man said. “Put  into  that cairn  more’n  a
month aJo,  by the  look,  and leIt  there  to await  our  cominJ.  Stone and
mortar where he  came throuJh into  the  cellar were  untouched when we
insSected the Slace yesterday. I’ll stake my reSutation on it.”
   “No  one Tuestions your thorouJhness,” Jessica said.
   “I  Tuestion it, my Lady. We should’ve used sonic Srobes down there.”
   “I  Sresume that’s what you’re doinJ now,” Paul said.
   “Yes, sir.”
   “Send word to my Iather that we’ll  be delayed.”
   “At  once, sir.”  He Jlanced at Jessica. “It’s Hawat’s order that under such
circumstances as these the younJ master be Juarded in a saIe Slace.” AJain,
his eyes sweSt the room. “What oI this Slace?”
   “I’ve    reason to  believe  it  saIe,”  she said.  “Both   Hawat  and I   have
insSected it.”
   “Then  I’ll  mount  Juard outside here, m’Lady, until we’ve  been over the
house once more.”  He bowed,  touched his caS to  Paul, backed out  and
swunJ the door closed behind him.
   Paul broke the sudden silence, sayinJ: “Had we better Jo over the house
later ourselves? Your eyes miJht see thinJs others would miss.”

90
   “This  winJ  was the only Slace I hadn’t e[amined,” she said. “I Sut iI  oII
to last because….”
   “Because Hawat Jave it his Sersonal attention,” he said.
   She darted a Tuick look at his Iace, TuestioninJ.
   “Do  you distrust Hawat?” she asked.
   “No,  but he’s JettinJ old …  he’s overworked. We could take some oI the
load Irom him.”
   “That’d   only shame him  and imSair his  eIIiciency,”  she said. “A  stray
insect won’t be able to wander into this winJ aIter he hears about this. He’ll
be shamed that….”
   “We must take our own measures,” he said.
   “Hawat  has served three Jenerations oI Atreides with  honor,”  she said.
“He deserves every resSect and trust we can Say him … many times over.”
   Paul  said: “When  my Iather  is bothered by  somethinJ you’ve  done he
says ‘Bene Gesserit!’ like a swear word.”
   “And  what is it about me that bothers your Iather?”
   “When  you arJue with him.”
   “You  are not your Iather, Paul.”
   And  Paul thouJht:  It’ll   worry  her, but I  must tell  her what that  Mapes
woman said about a traitor among us.
   “What’re  you holdinJ back?” Jessica asked. “This isn’t like you, Paul.”
   He shruJJed, recounted the e[chanJe with MaSes.
   And  Jessica thouJht  oI  the messaJe oI the  leaI.  She came to  sudden
decision, showed Paul the leaI, told him its messaJe.
   “My  Iather must learn oI this at once,” he said. “I’ll  radioJraSh it in code
and Jet iI oII.”
   “No,”   she said. “You will   wait  until you  can see him alone. As  Iew as
Sossible must learn about it.”
   “Do  you mean we should trust no one?”
   “There’s  another Sossibility,”  she said. “This   messaJe may have been
meant to Jet to us. The SeoSle who Jave it to us may believe it’s true, but it
may be that the only SurSose was to Jet this messaJe to us.”
   Paul’s Iace remained sturdily  somber. “To sow distrust and susSicion in
our ranks, to weaken us that way,” he said.
   “You  must tell your Iather Srivately and caution him about this asSect oI
it,” she said.
   “I  understand.”

91
   She turned  to the tall  reach oI  Iilter  Jlass, stared out  to the southwest
where the sun oI Arrakis was sinkinJ—a yellowed ball above the cliIIs.
   Paul turned with  her, said: “I don’t  think it’s  Hawat, either. Is it Sossible
it’s Yueh?”
   “He’s  not a lieutenant or comSanion,” she said. “And I can assure you he
hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do.”
   Paul  directed  his attention  to  the  cliIIs,  thinkinJ:   And  it  couldn’t  be
Gurney… or Duncan. Could  it  be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible.
They’re all from families that’ve been loyal to us for generations—for good
reason.
   Jessica rubbed her Iorehead, sensinJ her own IatiJue. So much peril here!
She looked out  at the  Iilter-yellowed  landscaSe, studyinJ it.  Beyond the
ducal Jrounds stretched a hiJh-Ienced storaJe yard—lines oI sSice silos in
it  with  stilt-leJJed  watchtowers standinJ around it  like  so  many startled
sSiders. She could see at least twenty storaJe yards oI silos reachinJ out to
the cliIIs oI the Shield Wall—silos reSeated, stutterinJ across the basin.
   Slowly,  the  Iiltered sun  buried itselI  beneath the horizon.  Stars leaSed
out. She saw one briJht star so low  on the horizon that it  twinkled  with  a
clear, Srecise rhythm—a tremblinJ oI liJht: blink-blink-blink-blink-blink   …
   Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room.
   But  Jessica concentrated on that sinJle briJht star, realizinJ  that it  was
too low, that it must come Irom the Shield Wall cliIIs.
   Someone signalling!
   She tried to read the messaJe, but it was in no code she had ever learned.
   Other  liJhts  had come  on down  on  the Slain  beneath the cliIIs:  little
yellows sSaced out aJainst blue darkness. And  one liJht  oII  to  their  leIt
Jrew  briJhter,  beJan to  wink   back  at  the cliII—very    Iast:  blinksTuirt,
Jlimmer, blink!
   And  it was Jone.
   The Ialse star in the cliII winked out immediately.
   SiJnals … and they Iilled her with Sremonition.
   Why were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herselI. Why
couldn’t they use the communications network?
   The answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be taSSed now
by aJents oI the Duke  Leto. LiJht  siJnals could only  mean that messaJes
were beinJ sent between his enemies—between Harkonnen aJents.

92
    There came  a taSSinJ at the  door  behind them  and the  voice  oI  Hawat’s
man: “All    clear, sir  ..  m‘Lady.  Time  to  be JettinJ   the  younJ  master to  his
Iather.”

93
        It  is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly
        into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of
        extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately
        sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a
        man not easily hoodwinked.
                                           —from “Muad’Dib: Family Commentaries” by the Princess Irulan



 
  THE DUKE    Leto   Atreides   leaned   aJainst   a SaraSet  oI  the  landinJ    control
tower  outside   Arrakeen.    The  niJht’s   Iirst   moon,   an  oblate  silver   coin,   hunJ
well  above   the  southern   horizon.   Beneath   it,  the  MaJJed cliIIs   oI  the  Shield
Wall  shone  like   Sarched  icinJ   throuJh    a dust  haze.  To  his  leIt,   the  liJhts   oI
Arrakeen   Jlowed   in  the haze—yellow     …  white   …  blue.
    He  thouJht   oI  the  notices   Sosted  now  above  his  siJnature   all   throuJh   the
SoSulous  Slaces oI  the  Slanet:  “Our   Sublime   Padishah   EmSeror   has charJed
me to  take  Sossession oI  this  Slanet  and  end  all  disSute.”
    The   ritualistic    Iormality     oI   it  touched   him   with    a IeelinJ    oI   loneliness.
Who  was  fooled   by  that   fatuous   legalism?    Not   the  Fremen,   certainly.    Nor
the Houses   Minor   who   controlled    the  interior    trade  of  Arrakis    …  and  were
Harkonnen   creatures   almost   to a  man.
    They  have  tried  to  take  the life   of my  son!
    The  raJe  was diIIicult     to suSSress.
    He  saw  liJhts   oI  a movinJ    vehicle   cominJ    toward   the  landinJ   Iield   Irom
Arrakeen.   He   hoSed  it  was  the  Juard   and  trooS   carrier   brinJinJ    Paul.   The
delay  was  JallinJ    even  thouJh   he  knew   it  was  SromSted   by  caution   on  the
Sart oI  Hawat’s   lieutenant.
    They  have  tried  to  take  the life   of my  son!
    He  shook   his  head  to  drive    out  the  anJry   thouJhts,    Jlanced   back  at  the
Iield    where   Iive    oI   his   own    IriJates    were    Sosted   around   the   rim    like
monolithic    sentries.
    Better  a  cautious   delay  than  …
    The  lieutenant    was  a Jood   one,  he reminded    himselI.   A   man  marked   Ior
advancement,   completely   loyal.
    “Our    Sublime  Padishah   Emperor….    ”
    II  the  SeoSle  oI  this  decadent   Jarrison   city   could   only  see  the  EmSeror’s
Srivate   note  to  his   “Noble    Duke”—the     disdainIul     allusions   to  veiled    men

94
and women: “… but what else is one to e[Sect oI barbarians whose dearest
dream is to live outside the ordered security oI the IauIreluches?”
   The Duke  Ielt in  this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all
class distinctions and never aJain think oI deadly order. He looked uS and
out oI the  dust at the unwinkinJ  stars, thouJht: Around one of  those little
lights circles Caladan … but I’ll  never again see my home. The lonJinJ Ior
Caladan was a sudden Sain in his breast. He Ielt that it did not come Irom
within himselI,  but that it  reached out to him Irom  Caladan. He could not
brinJ himselI to call this dry wasteland oI Arrakis his home, and he doubted
he ever would.
   I  must mask my feelings, he thouJht. For  the boy’s sake. If ever he’s to
have a home, this must be it. I may think of Arrakis  as a hell  I’ve reached
before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must
be something.
   A  wave  oI selI-Sity,  immediately desSised and reMected, sweSt throuJh
him, and Ior some reason he Iound himselI recallinJ two lines Irom a Soem
Gurney Halleck oIten reSeated—

       “My  lunJs taste the air oI Time 
       Blown  Sast IallinJ sands….” 

   Well,  Gurney would Iind  Slenty oI IallinJ  sands here, the Duke thouJht.
The central  wastelands beyond those  moon-Irosted cliIIs   were desert—
barren rock, dunes, and  blowinJ  dust, an  uncharted dry wilderness  with
here and there  alonJ its  rim  and  SerhaSs scattered throuJh it,  knots oI
Fremen. II anythinJ could buy a Iuture Ior the Atreides line, the Fremen Must
miJht do it.
   Provided the Harkonnens hadn’t manaJed to inIect even the Fremen with
their Soisonous schemes.
   They have tried to take the life of my son!
   A  scraSinJ metal  racket vibrated throuJh  the tower, shook  the SaraSet
beneath his arms. Blast shutters droSSed in Iront oI him, blockinJ the view.
   Shuttle’s coming in,  he thouJht. Time to  go down  and get to  work. He
turned to the  stairs behind him,  headed down to the  biJ assembly room,
tryinJ to  remain calm as he descended, to SreSare his Iace Ior the cominJ
encounter.
   They have tried to take the life of my son!

95
   The  men were  already boilinJ  in  Irom  the  Iield  when he  reached the
yellow-domed room.  They  carried  their  sSacebaJs over their shoulders,
shoutinJ and roisterinJ like students returninJ Irom vacation.
   “Hey!  Feel that under your doJs? That’s Jravity, man!”  “How  many G’s
does this Slace Sull? Feels heavy.” “Nine-tenths oI a G by the book.”
   The crossIire oI thrown words Iilled the biJ room.
   “Did  you  Jet a Jood look at this hole on the way  down? Where’s all the
loot this  Slace’s suSSosed to have?” “The Harkonnens took it with  ’em!”
“Me  Ior  a hot  shower and a  soIt bed!”  “Haven’t   you heard, stuSid? No
showers down here. You  scrub your  ass with  sand!”  “Hey!  Can it!   The
Duke!”
   The  Duke  steSSed out oI the  stair entry  into  a suddenly  silent room.
Gurney Halleck  strode  alonJ  at  the Soint  oI  the  crowd,  baJ  over  one
shoulder, the neck oI his nine-strinJ baliset clutched in the other hand. They
were lonJ-IinJered  hands with  biJ   thumbs, Iull  oI  tiny   movements that
drew such delicate music Irom the baliset.
   The Duke watched Halleck, admirinJ the uJly  lumS oI a man, notinJ the
Jlass-sSlinter eyes with their  Jleam oI  savaJe understandinJ. Here was a
man who lived outside the IauIreluches while  obeyinJ their every SreceSt.
What was it Paul had called him? “Gurney, the valorous. ”
   Halleck’s  wisSy blond  hair trailed  across barren sSots on his head. His
wide mouth was twisted into  a Sleasant sneer, and the scar oI the inkvine
whiS slashed across his Mawline seemed to move with a liIe oI its own. His
whole air was oI  casual, shoulder-set caSability. He came uS to the Duke,
bowed.
   “Gurney,”  Leto said.
   “My   Lord.”  He  Jestured with  the baliset toward the  men in  the room.
“This is the last oI  them. I’d  have SreIerred cominJ in with the Iirst  wave,
but….”
   “There  are still  some Harkonnens Ior you,”  the Duke  said. “SteS aside
with me, Gurney, where we may talk.”
   “Yours to command, my Lord.”
   They  moved into  an alcove beside a coil-slot  water machine while  the
men stirred  restlessly in  the  biJ  room.  Halleck  droSSed his baJ  into  a
corner, keSt his JriS on the baliset.
   “How  many men can you let Hawat have?” the Duke asked.
   “Is  ThuIir in  trouble, Sire?”

96
   “He’s  lost only two aJents, but his advance men Jave us an e[cellent line
on the entire Harkonnen setuS here. II we move Iast we may Jain a measure
oI security, the breathinJ sSace we reTuire. He wants as many men as you
can sSare—men who won’t balk at a little kniIe work.”
   “I  can let him have three hundred oI my best,” Halleck said. “Where shall
I send them?”
   “To  the main Jate. Hawat has an aJent there waitinJ to take them.”
   “Shall  I Jet about it at once, Sire?”
   “In   a moment. We  have another Sroblem. The  Iield  commandant will
hold the  shuttle here until  dawn on  a Srete[t.  The Guild  HeiJhliner  that
brouJht us is  JoinJ  on  about its  business, and the shuttle’s suSSosed to
make contact with a carJo shiS takinJ uS a load oI sSice.”
   “Our  sSice, m’Lord?”
   “Our  sSice. But the shuttle also will carry some oI the sSice hunters Irom
the old reJime. They’ve oSted to leave with the chanJe oI IieI and the JudJe
oI the  ChanJe is allowinJ  it.  These are valuable workers,  Gurney, about
eiJht hundred oI them. BeIore the shuttle leaves, you must Sersuade some
oI those men to enlist with us.”
   “How  stronJ a Sersuasion, Sire?”
   “I   want their  willinJ   cooSeration, Gurney. Those men have e[Serience
and skills we need. The Iact that they’re leavinJ suJJests they’re not Sart oI
the Harkonnen machine.  Hawat believes  there could  be some bad  ones
Slanted in the JrouS, but he sees assassins in every shadow.”
   “ThuIir  has Iound some very Sroductive shadows in his time, m’Lord.”
   “And  there are some he hasn’t Iound. But I think SlantinJ sleeSers in this
outJoinJ crowd would show too much imaJination Ior the Harkonnens.”
   “Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?”
   “Down  on the lower level, in a waitinJ  room. I suJJest you Jo down and
Slay a tune or two to soIten their minds, then turn on the Sressure. You may
oIIer  Sositions oI  authority  to those who  TualiIy.  OIIer  twenty  Ser cent
hiJher waJes than they received under the Harkonnens.”
   “No  more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen Say scales. And to men
with their  termination Say in their  Sockets and the wanderlust on them …
well, Sire, twenty Ser cent would hardly seem SroSer inducement to stay.”
   Leto  sSoke imSatiently:  “Then  use  your  own  discretion  in  Sarticular
cases. Just remember that the treasury isn’t bottomless. Hold it  to twenty

97
Ser cent whenever you  can. We Sarticularly  need sSice drivers,  weather
scanners, dune men—any with oSen sand e[Serience.”
   “I   understand, Sire. ‘They shall come all  Ior  violence: their  Iaces shall
suS uS as the east wind, and they shall Jather the caStivity oI the sand.’ ”
   “A   very movinJ  Tuotation,”  the Duke said. “Turn  your  crew over  to a
lieutenant. Have him Jive a short drill on water disciSline, then bed the men
down Ior the niJht  in the barracks adMoininJ the Iield. Field Sersonnel will
direct them. And don’t IorJet the men Ior Hawat.”
   “Three hundred oI the best, Sire.” He took uS his sSacebaJ. “Where shall
I reSort to you when I’ve comSleted my chores?”
   “I’ve   taken over  a council  room toSside here. We’ll  hold  staII there. I
want to arranJe a new Slanetary disSersal order with armored sTuads JoinJ
out Iirst.”
   Halleck  stoSSed in the act oI turninJ away, cauJht Leto’s eye. “Are you
anticiSatinJ that kind  oI trouble,  Sire? I thouJht  there was a JudJe oI the
ChanJe here.”
   “Both  oSen battle and secret,” the Duke said. “There’ll be blood aSlenty
sSilled here beIore we’re throuJh.”
   “‘And   the water which  thou takest out  oI the river  shall become blood
uSon the dry land,’ ” Halleck Tuoted.
   The Duke siJhed. “Hurry back, Gurney.”
   “Very  Jood,  m‘Lord.”  The  whiSscar riSSled to his Jrin.  “‘Behold,  as a
wild  ass in the desert, Jo  I  Iorth to  my  work.’”   He turned, strode to  the
center oI the room, Saused to relay his orders, hurried on throuJh the men.
   Leto  shook  his  head at  the retreatinJ  back.  Halleck  was a  continual
amazement—a head Iull oI sonJs, Tuotations, and Ilowery Shrases … and
the heart oI an assassin when it came to dealinJ with the Harkonnens.
   Presently,  Leto  took   a  leisurely  diaJonal  course  across to   the  liIt,
acknowledJinJ   salutes with    a  casual  hand   wave.  He   recoJnized  a
SroSaJanda corSsman, stoSSed to Jive him a messaJe that could be relayed
to the men throuJh  channels: those who had brouJht their  women would
want to know  the women were  saIe and where they could be Iound.  The
others would wish to know that the SoSulation here aSSeared to boast more
women than men.
   The  Duke  slaSSed the SroSaJanda man on the arm, a  siJnal  that the
messaJe had toS Sriority to be Sut out immediately, then continued across

98
the room.   He  nodded to   the  men,  smiled,  traded Sleasantries with   a
subaltern.
   Command must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on
your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.
   He  breathed a siJh oI relieI  when the  liIt  swallowed him  and he could
turn and Iace the imSersonal doors.
   They have tried to take the life of my son!

99
        Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument,
        there was an inscription that Muad‘Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night on
        Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his father’s first full
        staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell
        with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death. They
        said: “O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers,”
                                                             —from “Manual of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
  “THE  WHOLE    theory    oI  warIare   is   calculated   risk,”    the  Duke   said,   “but
when  it  comes   to  riskinJ   your   own   Iamily,    the  element  oI   calculation     Jets
submerJed  in  …  other  thinJs.”
    He  knew    he  wasn’t   holdinJ     in  his   anJer  as  well    as he  should,    and  he
turned,  strode  down   the lenJth   oI  the  lonJ  table  and  back.
    The   Duke   and  Paul   were   alone   in  the  conIerence    room   at   the  landinJ
Iield.   It  was  an  emSty-soundinJ     room,   Iurnished    only   with   the   lonJ   table,
old-Iashioned    three-leJJed    chairs   around  it,   and a  maS  board  and  SroMector
at one  end.  Paul  sat  at  the table   near  the  maS board.   He  had  told  his   Iather
the  e[Serience    with   the   hunter-seeker    and  Jiven    the  reSorts   that  a  traitor
threatened  him.
    The  Duke   stoSSed  across  Irom   Paul,  Sounded   the  table:  “Hawat    told   me
that house  was  secure!”
    Paul  sSoke  hesitantly:    “I   was  anJry,   too—at   Iirst.    And  I  blamed   Hawat.
But   the  threat   came   Irom    outside   the   house.   It   was   simSle,   clever,   and
direct.  And   it  would’ve     succeeded  were   it  not  Ior  the  traininJ    Jiven   me  by
you  and many  others—includinJ      Hawat.”
    “Are   you  deIendinJ    him?”   the Duke   demanded.
    “Yes.”
    “He’s   JettinJ   old.  That’s   it.  He  should  be—”
    “He’s    wise  with    much   e[Serience,”     Paul  said.   “How    many   oI   Hawat’s
mistakes  can  you  recall?”
    “I  should   be the  one  deIendinJ   him,”   the  Duke  said.  “Not   you.”
    Paul  smiled.
    Leto  sat  down  at  the  head oI  the  table,  Sut  a hand  over  his  son’s.  “You’ve
…  matured   lately,   Son.”   He  liIted   his  hand.  “It   Jladdens   me.”   He  matched

100
his son’s smile. “Hawat will Sunish himselI. He’ll  direct more anJer aJainst
himselI over this than both oI us toJether could Sour on him.”
   Paul  Jlanced  toward  the  darkened windows  beyond  the  maS board,
looked at  the  niJht’s  blackness. Room  liJhts  reIlected  Irom   a balcony
railinJ out there. He saw movement and recoJnized the shaSe oI a Juard in
Atreides uniIorm. Paul looked back at the white wall behind his Iather, then
down to the shiny surIace oI the table, seeinJ his own hands clenched into
Iists there.
   The door oSSosite the Duke banJed oSen. ThuIir Hawat strode throuJh it
lookinJ older and more leathery than ever. He Saced down the lenJth oI the
table, stoSSed at attention IacinJ Leto.
   “My   Lord,”  he said, sSeakinJ to a Soint  over Leto’s head, “I  have Must
learned how I Iailed you. It becomes necessary that I tender my resiJ—”
   “Oh,  sit down and stoS actinJ the Iool,”  the Duke said. He waved to the
chair across Irom Paul. “II you made a mistake, it was in overestimatinJ the
Harkonnens. Their simSle minds came uS with  a simSle trick.  We  didn’t
count on simSle tricks. And my  son has been at Jreat Sains to Soint out to
me that he came throuJh this larJely  because oI your traininJ. You  didn’t
Iail there!” He taSSed the back oI the emSty chair. “Sit down, I say!”
   Hawat sank into the chair. “But—”
   “I’ll    hear no more oI it,”  the Duke said. “The  incident is  Sast. We have
more SressinJ business. Where are the others?”
   “I  asked them to wait outside while I—”
   “Call  them in.”
   Hawat looked into Leto’s eyes. “Sire, I—”
   “I   know who  my  true Iriends are, ThuIir,”   the Duke  said. “Call  in  the
men.”
   Hawat swallowed.  “At  once, my Lord.”  He swiveled in  the chair, called
to the oSen door: “Gurney, brinJ them in.”
   Halleck  led  the  Iile  oI  men  into  the room,  the  staII  oIIicers  lookinJ
Jrimly  serious Iollowed   by  the younJer  aides and sSecialists, an  air oI
eaJerness amonJ them. BrieI scuIIinJ sounds echoed around the room as
the men took seats. A Iaint smell oI rachaJ stimulant waIted down the table.
   “There’s coIIee Ior those who want it,” the Duke said.
   He looked over his  men, thinkinJ: They’re a good crew. A man could do
far worse for this kind  of war. He waited while coIIee was brouJht in  Irom
the adMoininJ room and served, notinJ the tiredness in some oI the Iaces.

101
   Presently,  he  Sut  on   his  mask   oI  Tuiet   eIIiciency,   stood  uS  and
commanded their attention with a knuckle raS aJainst the table.
   “Well,   Jentlemen,”  he  said, “our   civilization   aSSears to’ve Iallen  so
deeSly into the habit oI invasion that we cannot even obey a simSle order oI
the ImSerium without the old ways croSSinJ uS.”
   Dry  chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his Iather
had said the Srecisely correct thinJ in Srecisely the correct tone to liIt   the
mood here. Even the hint oI IatiJue in his voice was riJht.
   “I  think  Iirst we’d  better learn iI ThuIir  has anythinJ to add to his reSort
on the Fremen,” the Duke said. “ThuIir?”
   Hawat  Jlanced uS.  “I’ve  some  economic matters to  Jo  into  aIter my
Jeneral reSort, Sire, but I  can say now  that the Fremen aSSear more and
more to be the allies we need. They’re waitinJ now to  see iI they can trust
us, but they aSSear to be dealinJ oSenly. They’ve sent us a JiIt—stillsuits oI
their  own   manuIacture  …  maSs  oI   certain  desert  areas surroundinJ
stronJSoints the  Harkonnens  leIt  behind….”   He  Jlanced  down  at  the
table.“Their intelliJence  reSorts have Sroved comSletely reliable and have
helSed us considerably  in  our  dealinJs with   the  JudJe oI  the  ChanJe.
They’ve also  sent some incidental  thinJs—Mewelry Ior the Lady  Jessica,
sSice liTuor, candy, medicinals. My men are SrocessinJ the lot riJht  now.
There aSSears to be no trickery.”
   “You  like these SeoSle, ThuIir?” asked a man down the table.
   Hawat  turned to Iace his  Tuestioner. “Duncan Idaho says they’re to  be
admired.”
   Paul Jlanced at his Iather, back to Hawat, ventured a Tuestion: “Have you
any new inIormation on how many Fremen there are?”
   Hawat looked  at Paul. “From Iood SrocessinJ and other evidence, Idaho
estimates the cave  comSle[  he  visited  consisted oI  some ten  thousand
SeoSle, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch oI two thousand hearths.
We’ve reason to believe there are a Jreat many  such sietch communities.
All seem to Jive their alleJiance to someone called Liet.”
   “That’s  somethinJ new,” Leto said.
   “It   could be an error  on my Sart, Sire. There  are thinJs to suJJest this
Liet may be a local diety.”
   Another  man down the table cleared his throat, asked: “Is it certain they
deal with the smuJJlers?”

102
   “A   smuJJler caravan leIt  this sietch while  Idaho  was there, carryinJ  a
heavy load oI  sSice. They used Sack beasts and indicated they  Iaced an
eiJhteen-day Mourney.”
   “It   aSSears,” the Duke said, “that  the  smuJJlers have redoubled  their
oSerations durinJ this Seriod oI unrest. This deserves some careIul thouJht.
We shouldn’t  worry  too much  about unlicensed IriJates workinJ   oII  our
Slanet—it’s  always  done.  But   to   have  them  comSletely  outside  our
observation—that’s not Jood.”
   “You  have a Slan, Sire,” Hawat asked.
   The Duke  looked at Halleck. “Gurney,  I want  you to head a deleJation,
an embassy iI you will,   to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them
I’ll  iJnore their oSerations as lonJ as they Jive me a ducal tithe. Hawat here
estimates that JraIt  and  e[tra  IiJhtinJ   men  heretoIore reTuired in   their
oSerations have been costinJ them Iour times that amount.”
   “What   iI  the EmSeror  Jets wind  oI  this?”  Halleck  asked. “He’s  very
Mealous oI his CHOAM SroIits, m’Lord.”
   Leto  smiled. “We’ll  bank the entire tithe oSenly in the name oI Shaddam
IV  and deduct it leJally  Irom  our levy  suSSort costs. Let the Harkonnens
IiJht that! And we’ll  be ruininJ a Iew more oI the locals who Jrew Iat under
the Harkonnen system. No more JraIt!”
   A   Jrin  twisted  Halleck’s  Iace.  “Ahh,   m’Lord,  a  beautiIul  low   blow.
Would that I could see the Baron’s Iace when he learns oI this.”
   The Duke turned to Hawat. “ThuIir,  did you Jet those account books you
said you could buy?”
   “Yes,   my  Lord.   They’re  beinJ   e[amined  in   detail  even  now.  I’ve
skimmed them, thouJh, and can Jive a Iirst aSSro[imation.”
   “Give  it, then.”
   “The  Harkonnens took ten billion solaris out oI here every three hundred
and thirty Standard days.”
   A  muted  JasS ran around the table. Even the  younJer aides, who  had
been betrayinJ some boredom, sat uS straiJhter and e[chanJed wide-eyed
looks.
   Halleck  murmured: “‘For   they shall suck  oI the  abundance oI the seas
and oI the treasure hid in the sand.’ ”
   “You   see, Jentlemen,”  Leto  said. “Is   there anyone here  so naive  he
believes the Harkonnens have Tuietly Sacked uS and walked away Irom all
this merely because the EmSeror ordered it?”

103
   There was a Jeneral shakinJ oI heads, murmurous aJreement.
   “We  will  have to take it at the Soint oI the sword,”  Leto said. He turned
to Hawat.  “This’d   be a  Jood Soint  to  reSort on eTuiSment. How  many
sandcrawlers, harvesters, sSice Iactories, and suSSortinJ eTuiSment have
they leIt us?”
   “A   Iull  comSlement, as it says in the ImSerial inventory  audited by the
JudJe oI the ChanJe, my Lord,” Hawat said. He Jestured Ior an aide to Sass
him a Iolder, oSened the Iolder on the table in Iront oI him. “They neJlect to
mention that less than halI the crawlers are oSerable, that only about a third
have carryalls to Ily  them to sSice sands—that everythinJ the Harkonnens
leIt us is ready to break down and Iall aSart. We’ll  be lucky to Jet halI  the
eTuiSment into oSeration and luckier yet iI a Iourth oI it’s still  workinJ  si[
months Irom now.”
   “Pretty  much as we e[Sected,”  Leto said. “What’s  the Iirm  estimate on
basic eTuiSment?”
   Hawat  Jlanced at his Iolder.  “About  nine hundred and thirty  harvester-
Iactories that can be sent out in a Iew  days. About si[ty-two   hundred and
IiIty  ornithoSters Ior survey, scoutinJ, and weather observation … carryalls,
a little under a thousand.”
   Halleck  said:  “Wouldn’t  it  be  cheaSer to reoSen neJotiations with the
Guild Ior Sermission to orbit a IriJate as a weather satellite?”
   The Duke looked at Hawat. “NothinJ new there, eh, ThuIir?”
   “We  must Sursue other avenues Ior now,” Hawat said. “The Guild aJent
wasn’t really  neJotiatinJ  with  us.  He  was merely  makinJ  it  Slain—one
Mentat to another—that the Srice was out oI our reach and would remain so
no matter how lonJ a reach we develoS. Our task is to Iind out why beIore
we aSSroach him aJain.”
   One  oI Halleck’s  aides down  the table swiveled  in his  chair, snaSSed:
“There’s no Mustice in this!”
   “Justice?” The Duke looked at the man. “Who asks Ior Mustice? We make
our own Mustice. We make it here on Arrakis—win  or  die. Do  you reJret
castinJ your lot with us, sir?”
   The  man stared at the Duke,  then: “No,   Sire. You couldn’t  turn  and I
could do nouJht but Iollow you. ForJive the outburst, but….”  He shruJJed.
“… we must all Ieel bitter at times.”
   “Bitterness I  understand,” the Duke said. “But let us not rail about Mustice
as lonJ as we have arms and the Ireedom to use them. Do any oI the rest oI

104
you harbor bitterness? II so, let  it  out. This is  Iriendly  council where any
man may sSeak his mind.”
   Halleck  stirred,  said: “I  think  what  rankles, Sire, is that  we’ve  had no
volunteers Irom the other Great Houses. They address you as ‘Leto the Just’
and Sromise eternal IriendshiS, but  only  as lonJ  as it  doesn’t cost them
anythinJ.”
   “They  don’t know yet who’s  JoinJ to win  this e[chanJe,” the Duke said.
“Most oI  the Houses have Jrown Iat by takinJ Iew  risks. One cannot truly
blame them Ior this; one can only desSise them.” He looked at Hawat. “We
were discussinJ eTuiSment. Would you care to SroMect a Iew e[amSles to
Iamiliarize the men with this machinery?”
   Hawat nodded, Jestured to an aide at the SroMector.
   A  solido  tri-D  SroMection aSSeared on the table surIace about a third oI
the way down Irom the Duke. Some oI the men Iarther alonJ the table stood
uS to Jet a better look at it.
   Paul leaned Iorward, starinJ at the machine.
   Scaled aJainst the tiny SroMected human IiJures around it, the thinJ was
about one hundred and twenty meters lonJ and about Iorty meters wide. It
was basically a  lonJ,  buJlike  body movinJ  on  indeSendent sets oI wide
tracks.
   “This  is a harvester Iactory,”  Hawat said. “We chose one in Jood reSair
Ior this  SroMection. There’s one draJline outIit that came in with  the Iirst
team oI  ImSerial ecoloJists,  thouJh, and it’s   still  runninJ  …  althouJh I
don’t know how … or why.”
   “II   that’s the one they call ‘Old Maria,’  it belonJs in a museum,” an aide
said. “I think  the Harkonnens keSt it as a Sunishment Mob, a threat hanJinJ
over their workers’ heads. Be Jood or you’ll be assiJned to Old Maria.”
   Chuckles sounded around the table.
   Paul  held himselI  aSart Irom  the  humor, his  attention Iocused on  the
SroMection and the Tuestion that Iilled his mind. He Sointed to the imaJe on
the table, said: “ThuIir,   are there sandworms biJ enouJh to  swallow  that
whole?”
   Quick  silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then
thouJht: No—they have tofacethe realities here.
   “There’re  worms in  the deeS desert could take this entire Iactory in one
JulS,” Hawat  said. “US here closer to  the Shield Wall  where most oI  the

105
sSicinJ’s done there are Slenty oI worms that could criSSle this Iactory and
devour it at their leisure.”
   “Why  don’t we shield them?” Paul asked.
   “AccordinJ  to  Idaho’s reSort,” Hawat said, “shields are danJerous in the
desert. A  body-size shield will   call  every  worm  Ior  hundreds oI meters
around. It aSSears to drive them into  a killinJ   Irenzy. We’ve  the Fremen
word on  this and no reason to  doubt it.  Idaho saw no evidence oI  shield
eTuiSment at the sietch.”
   “None  at all?” Paul asked.
   “It’d   be Sretty hard to conceal that kind oI thinJ amonJ several thousand
SeoSle,” Hawat said. “Idaho had Iree access to every Sart oI the sietch. He
saw no shields or any indication oI their use.”
   “It’s  a Suzzle,” the Duke said.
   “The   Harkonnens certainly  used Slenty oI  shields  here,” Hawat  said.
“They had reSair deSots in every Jarrison villaJe, and their accounts show a
heavy e[Senditure Ior shield reSlacements and Sarts.”
   “Could  the Fremen have a way oI nulliIyinJ shields?” Paul asked.
   “It   doesn’t  seem likely,”    Hawat  said. “It’s   theoretically   Sossible, oI
course—a shire-sized static counter charJe is suSSosed to do the trick, but
no one’s ever been able to Sut it to the test.”
   “We’d  have  heard about it beIore  now,”  Halleck said. “The  smuJJlers
have close contact with the Fremen and would’ve acTuired such a device iI
it were available. And  they’d have had no inhibitions  aJainst marketinJ it
oII Slanet.”
   “I   don’t  like  an  unanswered Tuestion oI  this  imSortance,” Leto  said.
“ThuIir, I  want you to Jive toS Sriority to solution oI this Sroblem.”
   “We’re  already workinJ  on  it, my  Lord.”  He cleared his  throat. “Ah-h,
Idaho did say one thinJ: he said you  couldn’t mistake the Fremen attitude
toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them.”
   The  Duke   Irowned,  then:  “The   subMect under discussion is  sSicinJ
eTuiSment.”
   Hawat Jestured to his aide at the SroMector.
   The solido-imaJe oI the harvester-Iactory was reSlaced by a SroMection oI
a winJed device that dwarIed the imaJes oI human IiJures around it. “This
is a  carryall,”  Hawat  said. “It’s   essentially a  larJe  ‘thoSter, whose sole
Iunction is to deliver a Iactory to sSice-rich sands, then to rescue the Iactory

106
when a sandworm aSSears. They always aSSear. HarvestinJ the sSice is a
Srocess oI JettinJ in and JettinJ out with as much as Sossible.”
   “Admirably   suited to Harkonnen morality,” the Duke said.
   LauJhter was abruSt and too loud.
   An  ornithoSter reSlaced the carryall in the SroMection Iocus.
   “These    ‘thoSters   are   Iairly    conventional,”    Hawat   said.    “MaMor
modiIications  Jive  them  e[tended  ranJe.  E[tra   care has  been used  in
sealinJ essential areas aJainst sand and dust. Only about one in  thirty  is
shielded—Sossibly discardinJ  the  shield  Jenerator’s weiJht   Ior  Jreater
ranJe.”
   “I   don’t like  this  de-emShasis on shields,” the Duke muttered. And  he
thouJht: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won’t even be able
to escape on shielded frigates if  all  goes against us?  He shook his  head
sharSly to drive out such thouJhts, said: “Let’s Jet to the workinJ estimate.
What’ll our SroIit IiJure  be?”
   Hawat turned two SaJes in his notebook. “AIter assessinJ the reSairs and
oSerable eTuiSment, we’ve worked out a Iirst estimate on oSeratinJ costs.
It’s based naturally on a deSreciated IiJure Ior  a clear saIety marJin.”  He
closed his   eyes in   Mentat  semitrance,  said:  “Under   the  Harkonnens,
maintenance and salaries were held to Iourteen Ser cent. We’ll be lucky to
make it  at thirty  Ser cent  at Iirst.  With  reinvestment and  Jrowth  Iactors
accounted Ior, includinJ  the CHOAM   SercentaJe and military  costs, our
SroIit marJin will  be reduced to a very narrow si[ or seven Ser cent until we
can reSlace worn-out eTuiSment. We then should be able to boost it uS to
twelve or IiIteen  Ser cent where it belonJs.”  He oSened his eyes. “Unless
my Lord wishes to adoSt Harkonnen methods.”
   “We’re   workinJ  Ior  a solid  and  Sermanent Slanetary base,” the Duke
said. “We have to keeS a larJe SercentaJe oI the SeoSle haSSy—esSecially
the Fremen.”
   “Most  esSecially the Fremen,” Hawat aJreed.
   “Our  suSremacy on Caladan,” the Duke said, “deSended on sea and air
Sower. Here, we must  develoS somethinJ I  choose to call  desert Sower.
This may include air Sower, but it’s Sossible it may not. I call your attention
to the lack oI ‘thoSter shields.” He shook his head. “The Harkonnens relied
on turnover Irom oII Slanet Ior some oI their key Sersonnel. We don’t dare.
Each new lot would have its Tuota oI Srovocateurs.”

107
   “Then   we’ll   have to   be content  with   Iar  less  SroIit  and  a  reduced
harvest,” Hawat said. “Our  outSut the Iirst two  seasons should be down a
third Irom the Harkonnen averaJe.”
   “There  it  is,”  the  Duke said, “e[actly   as we  e[Sected. ”We’ll   have to
move Iast with  the Fremen. I’d  like  Iive  Iull  battalions oI  Fremen trooSs
beIore the Iirst CHOAM audit.”
   “That’s  not much time, Sire,” Hawat said.
   “We  don’t  have  much time,  as you  well   know. They’ll   be here  with
Sardaukar disJuised as Harkonnens at the Iirst oSSortunity. How many do
you think they’ll  shiS in, ThuIir?”
   “Four  or  Iive  battalions  all  told, Sire.  No  more, Guild  trooS-transSort
costs beinJ what they are.”
   “Then  Iive  battalions oI Fremen Slus our own Iorces ouJht to do it.  Let
us have a Iew caStive Sardaukar to Sarade in Iront oI the Landsraad Council
and matters will be much diIIerent—SroIits or no SroIits.”
   “We’ll  do our best, Sire.”
   Paul  looked  at his  Iather,  back to  Hawat,  suddenly conscious  oI  the
Mentat’s Jreat aJe, aware that the old man had served three Jenerations oI
Atreides. Aged. It  showed in the rheumy  shine oI  the brown eyes, in  the
cheeks cracked and burned by e[otic weathers, in the rounded curve oI the
shoulders and the thin  set oI his  liSs with  the  cranberry-colored stain oI
saSho Muice.
   So much depends on one aged man, Paul thouJht.
   “We’re  Sresently in  a war oI  assassins,” the Duke said, “but  it has not
achieved Iull scale. ThuIir, what’s the condition oI  the Harkonnen machine
here?”
   “We’ve  eliminated  two hundred and IiIty-nine   oI  their key  SeoSle, my
Lord.  No  more than  three Harkonnen  cells remain—SerhaSs a hundred
SeoSle in all.”
   “These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated,” the Duke said, “were they
SroSertied?”
   “Most  were well situated, my Lord—in the entreSreneur class.”
   “I  want you to IorJe  certiIicates oI alleJiance over the siJnatures oI each
oI them,” the Duke  said. “File coSies with  the JudJe oI the ChanJe. We’ll
take the leJal Sosition  that they stayed under Ialse alleJiance. ConIiscate
their SroSerty, take everythinJ, turn out their Iamilies, striS them. And make
sure the Crown Jets its ten Ser cent. It must be entirely leJal.”

108
   ThuIir   smiled, revealinJ red-stained teeth beneath the carmine liSs. “A
move worthy oI your  Jrandsire, my Lord. It  shames me I didn’t think oI  it
Iirst.”
   Halleck  Irowned across the table, noticinJ  a deeS scowl on Paul’s Iace.
The others were smilinJ and noddinJ.
   It’s wrong, Paul thouJht. This’ll  only make the others fight all the harder.
They’ve nothing to gain by surrendering.
   He  knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled  in kanly,  but
this was the  sort oI  move that  could destroy them  even as it  Jave them
victory.
   “  ‘I  have been a stranJer in a stranJe land,’ ” Halleck Tuoted.
   Paul  stared  at  him,  recoJnizinJ  the  Tuotation  Irom  the  O.C.  Bible,
wonderinJ: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?
   The  Duke  Jlanced  at the  darkness out  the windows,  looked  back  at
Halleck. “Gurney, how many oI those sandworkers did you Sersuade to stay
with us?”
   “Two  hundred eiJhty-si[   in  all,  Sire. I  think  we should take them  and
consider ourselves lucky. They’re all in useIul cateJories.”
   “No  more?” The Duke  Sursed his liSs, then: “Well, Sass the word alonJ
to—”
   A  disturbance at the door interruSted him. Duncan Idaho  came throuJh
the Juard there,  hurried down  the lenJth  oI  the table  and bent over  the
Duke’s ear.
   Leto  waved him  back,  said: “SSeak out,  Duncan. You  can see this is
strateJy staII.”
   Paul studied Idaho, markinJ the Ieline movements, the swiItness oI reIle[
that made him  such a diIIicult   weaSons teacher to emulate. Idaho’s dark
round Iace  turned  toward  Paul,  the  cave-sitter eyes JivinJ   no  hint   oI
recoJnition, but Paul recoJnized the mask oI serenity over e[citement.
   Idaho looked down the lenJth  oI the table, said: “We’ve taken a Iorce oI
Harkonnen mercenaries disJuised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent
us a courier to warn oI the Ialse band. In the attack, however, we Iound the
Harkonnens had waylaid  the  Fremen courier—badly  wounded  him.  We
were brinJinJ him here Ior treatment by our medics when he died. I’d seen
how badly oII the man was and stoSSed to do what I could. I surSrised him
in the attemSt to throw somethinJ away.” Idaho Jlanced down at Leto.  “A
kniIe, m’Lord, a kniIe the like oI  which you’ve never seen.”

109
   “CryskniIe?”  someone asked.
   “No  doubt oI it,”  Idaho said. “Milky  white and JlowinJ  with a liJht  oI its
own like.”   He reached into his  tunic, brouJht  out a  sheath with a  black-
ridJed handle SrotrudinJ Irom it.
   “KeeS that blade in its sheath!”
   The voice came Irom the oSen door at the end oI the room, a vibrant and
SenetratinJ voice that brouJht them all uS, starinJ.
   A  tall, robed IiJure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords oI the
Juard. A liJht  tan robe comSletely enveloSed the man e[ceSt Ior a JaS in
the hood and black veil that e[Sosed eyes oI total blue—no white in them at
all.
   “Let  him enter,” Idaho whisSered.
   “Pass that man,” the Duke said.
   The Juards hesitated, then lowered their swords.
   The man sweSt into the room, stood across Irom the Duke.
   “This  is StilJar,  chieI oI the sietch I  visited, leader oI those who warned
us oI the Ialse band,” Idaho said.
   “Welcome, sir,”  Leto said. “And why shouldn’t we unsheath this blade?”
   StilJar  Jlanced at Idaho, said: “You observed the customs oI cleanliness
and honor amonJ us. I would  Sermit you to see the blade oI the man you
beIriended.” His  Jaze sweSt the others in the  room. “But  I  do  not know
these others. Would you have them deIile an honorable weaSon?”
   “I  am the Duke Leto,”  the Duke said. “Would  you Sermit me to see this
blade?”
   “I’ll    Sermit you to earn the riJht  to  unsheath it,” StilJar  said, and, as a
mutter oI Srotest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined
hand. “I remind you this is the blade oI one who beIriended you.”
   In  the waitinJ  silence, Paul studied the man, sensinJ the aura oI Sower
that radiated Irom him. He was a leader—a Fremen leader.
   A  man near the center oI the table across Irom Paul muttered: “Who’s he
to tell us what riJhts we have on Arrakis?”
   “It   is  said that  the Duke  Leto  Atreides rules  with  the  consent oI  the
Joverned,” the Fremen said. “Thus I must tell  you the way it  is with  us: a
certain resSonsibility Ialls on those who have seen a cryskniIe.” He Sassed a
dark Jlance across Idaho. “They  are ours. They may  never leave Arrakis
without our consent.”

110
   Halleck  and several oI  the others started to  rise, anJry  e[Sressions on
their Iaces. Halleck said: “The Duke Leto determines whether—”
   “One moment, Slease,” Leto said, and the very mildness oI his voice held
them. This must not get out of hand, he thouJht. He addressed himselI to the
Fremen: “Sir,  I  honor and resSect the Sersonal diJnity  oI  any  man who
resSects my diJnity. I  am indeed indebted to  you. And  I  always Say my
debts. II it is your custom that this kniIe  remain sheathed here, then it is so
ordered—by me. And iI there is any other way we may honor the man who
died in our service, you have but to name it.”
   The  Fremen  stared at  the  Duke,  then  slowly   Sulled  aside his  veil,
revealinJ a  thin  nose and Iull-liSSed  mouth in  a  JlisteninJ  black beard.
Deliberately he bent over the end oI the table, sSat on its Solished surIace.
   As  the men around the table started to surJe to their Ieet, Idaho’s voice
boomed across the room: “Hold!”
   Into  the sudden charJed stillness, Idaho said: “We thank you, StilJar, Ior
the JiIt oI  your body’s moisture. We acceSt it in the sSirit  with which  it is
Jiven.” And Idaho sSat on the table in Iront oI the Duke.
   Aside to the Duke, he said: “Remember how Srecious water is here, Sire.
That was a token oI resSect.”
   Leto  sank back into his own chair, cauJht Paul’s eye, a rueIul Jrin on his
son’s Iace,  sensed the  slow  rela[ation   oI  tension  around  the  table as
understandinJ came to his men.
   The  Fremen looked at  Idaho, said:  “You  measured well in  my  sietch,
Duncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your alleJiance to your Duke?”
   “He’s  askinJ me to enlist with him, Sire,” Idaho said.
   “Would  he acceSt a dual alleJiance?” Leto asked.
   “You  wish me to Jo with him, Sire?”
   “I  wish  you to make your own decision in the matter,” Leto said, and he
could not keeS the urJency out oI his voice.
   Idaho studied the Fremen. “Would  you have me under these conditions,
StilJar? There’d be times when I’d have to return to serve my Duke.”
   “You  IiJht  well  and you  did your  best Ior our  Iriend,”  StilJar  said. He
looked at Leto. “Let it  be thus: the man Idaho keeSs the cryskniIe he holds
as a mark oI his alleJiance to us. He  must be cleansed, oI course, and the
rites observed, but this can be done. He will  be Fremen and soldier oI the
Atreides. There is Srecedent Ior this: Liet serves two masters.”
   “Duncan?”  Leto asked.

111
   “I  understand, Sire,” Idaho said.
   “It  is aJreed, then,” Leto said.
   “Your  water is ours, Duncan Idaho,” StilJar said. “The body oI our Iriend
remains with your Duke. His  water is Atreides water. It is  a bond between
us.”
   Leto  siJhed,  Jlanced at Hawat,  catchinJ  the old  Mentat’s eye.  Hawat
nodded, his e[Sression Sleased.
   “I  will   await below,”  StilJar said, “while  Idaho makes Iarewell with  his
Iriends. Turok  was the name oI  our dead Iriend.  Remember that when it
comes time to release his sSirit. You are Iriends oI Turok.”
   StilJar  started to turn away.
   “Will   you not stay a while?” Leto asked.
   The  Fremen turned  back, whiSSinJ  his  veil  into  Slace with   a casual
Jesture, adMustinJ somethinJ beneath it. Paul JlimSsed what looked like a
thin tube beIore the veil settled into Slace.
   “Is  there reason to stay?” the Fremen asked.
   “We would  honor you,” the Duke said.
   “Honor   reTuires that I  be  elsewhere soon,” the Fremen  said. He shot
another Jlance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out Sast the door Juards.
   “II  the other Fremen match him, we’ll serve each other well,” Leto said.
   Idaho sSoke in a dry voice: “He’s a Iair samSle, Sire.”
   “You  understand what you’re to do, Duncan?”
   “I’m   your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire.”
   “Much   deSends on  you,  Duncan. We’re  JoinJ   to  need at  least Iive
battalions oI those SeoSle beIore the Sardaukar descend on us.”
   “This   is  JoinJ   to  take  some doinJ,   Sire.  The  Fremen are  a  Sretty
indeSendent bunch.” Idaho hesitated, then: “And,   Sire, there’s one  other
thinJ. One oI the mercenaries we knocked over was tryinJ to Jet this blade
Irom  our dead Fremen Iriend.  The  mercenary says there’s a  Harkonnen
reward oI a million solaris Ior anyone who’ll brinJ in  a sinJle cryskniIe.”
   Leto’s  chin came uS in a movement oI  obvious surSrise. “Why do they
want one oI those blades so badly?”
   “The   kniIe  is  Jround Irom   a sandworm’s tooth;  it’s   the mark  oI  the
Fremen, Sire. With  it, a  blue-eyed man could Senetrate any sietch in  the
land. They’d   Tuestion me  unless I  were  known.  I  don’t   look  Fremen.
But….”
   “Piter  de Vries,” the Duke said.

112
   “A  man oI devilish cunninJ, my Lord,”  Hawat said.
   Idaho sliSSed the sheathed kniIe beneath his tunic.
   “Guard that kniIe,”  the Duke said.
   “I   understand, m’Lord.”  He Satted the transceiver on  his belt  kit.  “I’ll
reSort soon as Sossible. ThuIir has my call code. Use battle lanJuaJe.” He
saluted, sSun about, and hurried aIter the Fremen.
   They heard his IootsteSs drumminJ down the corridor.
   A  look oI understandinJ Sassed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.
   “We’ve  much to do, Sire,” Halleck said.
   “And  I keeS you Irom your work,” Leto said.
   “I   have the reSort on the  advance bases,” Hawat said. “Shall  I  Jive it
another time, Sire?”
   “Will   it take lonJ?”
   “Not  Ior a brieIinJ.  It’s said amonJ the Fremen that there were more than
two hundred oI these advance bases built here on Arrakis durinJ the Desert
Botanical TestinJ Station Seriod. All suSSosedly have been abandoned, but
there are reSorts they were sealed oII beIore beinJ abandoned.”
   “ETuiSment in them?” the Duke asked.
   “AccordinJ  to the reSorts I have Irom Duncan.”
   “Where are they located?” Halleck asked.
   “The  answer to that Tuestion,” Hawat said, “is invariably: ‘Liet knows.’ ”
   “God  knows,” Leto muttered.
   “PerhaSs not, Sire,”  Hawat said. “You  heard this StilJar  use the name.
Could he have been reIerrinJ to a real Serson?”
   “ServinJ    two   masters,”  Halleck   said.  “It    sounds  like   a  reliJious
Tuotation.”
   “And  you should know,” the Duke said.
   Halleck smiled.
   “This   JudJe  oI   the  ChanJe,”   Leto  said,  “the   ImSerial  ecoloJist—
Kynes…. Wouldn’t he know where those bases are?”
   “Sire,”  Hawat cautioned, “this Kynes is an ImSerial servant.”
   “And  he’s a lonJ way Irom the EmSeror,” Leto said. “I  want those bases.
They’d be loaded with materials we could salvaJe and use Ior reSair oI our
workinJ eTuiSment.”
   “Sire!”  Hawat said. “Those bases are still leJally His MaMesty’s IieI.”
   “The  weather here’s savaJe enouJh to destroy anythinJ,” the Duke said.
“We can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least Iind out iI

113
the bases e[ist.”
   “‘Twere   danJerous to  commandeer them,” Hawat  said.  “Duncan  was
clear on  one  thinJ:   those bases or  the  idea  oI  them  hold  some deeS
siJniIicance Ior the Fremen. We miJht alienate the Fremen iI we took those
bases.”
   Paul looked at the Iaces oI the men around them, saw the intensity oI the
way they  Iollowed  every  word.  They  aSSeared deeSly disturbed by his
Iather’s attitude.
   “Listen  to him, Father,” Paul said in a low voice. “He sSeaks truth.”
   “Sire,”   Hawat said, “those bases could Jive  us material to reSair every
Siece oI eTuiSment leIt us, yet be beyond reach Ior strateJic reasons. It’d be
rash to move without Jreater knowledJe.  This Kynes has arbiter authority
Irom the ImSerium. We mustn’t IorJet that. And the Fremen deIer to him.”
   “Do  it  Jently, then,” the Duke  said. “I  wish to know  only iI  those bases
e[ist.”
   “As  you will,  Sire.” Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.
   “All   riJht,  then,” the Duke said. “We know what we have ahead oI us—
work. We’ve  been trained Ior  it.  We’ve some e[Serience in  it.  We know
what the rewards are and the  alternatives are clear enouJh. You all  have
your  assiJnments.” He   looked  at  Halleck.  “Gurney,  take  care  oI  that
smuJJler situation Iirst.”
   “‘I   shall  Jo  unto the  rebellious that dwell  in  the  dry  land,’  ”  Halleck
intoned.
   “Someday   I’ll   catch  that   man  without   a  Tuotation  and  he’ll   look
undressed,” the Duke said.
   Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the eIIort in them.
   The   Duke   turned  to   Hawat.  “Set   uS  another  command  Sost  Ior
intelliJence and communications on this Iloor, ThuIir. When you have them
ready, I’ll want to see you.”
   Hawat  arose, JlancinJ around the room  as thouJh seekinJ suSSort. He
turned away,  led  the  Srocession out   oI  the  room.  The  others  moved
hurriedly, scraSinJ their  chairs on  the Iloor,  ballinJ  uS  in  little  knots oI
conIusion.
   It  ended up in  confusion, Paul thouJht,  starinJ at the  backs oI the  last
men to  leave. Always   beIore, StaII  had  ended on an  incisive  air.  This
meetinJ had Must seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadeTuacies,
and with an arJument to toS it oII.

114
   For the Iirst  time, Paul allowed himselI to think about the real Sossibility
oI deIeat—not thinkinJ  about it out oI Iear or because oI warninJs such as
that oI  the old  Reverend Mother, but IacinJ  uS to  it  because oI his own
assessment oI the situation.
   My father is desperate, he thought. Things aren’t going well for us at all.
   And  Hawat—Paul  recalled  how the  old  Mentat  had acted durinJ  the
conIerence—subtie hesitations, siJns oI unrest.
   Hawat was deeSly troubled by somethinJ.
   “Best  you remain here the rest oI the niJht, Son,” the Duke said. “It’ll be
dawn soon, anyway. I’ll  inIorm  your  mother.”  He Jot  to his Ieet,  slowly,
stiIIly. “Why  don’t you Sull a Iew oI these chairs toJether and stretch out on
them Ior some rest.”
   “I’m   not very tired, sir.”
   “As  you will.”
   The  Duke Iolded his  hands behind him, beJan SacinJ uS and down the
lenJth oI the table.
   Like  a caJed animal, Paul thouJht.
   “Are   you  JoinJ  to   discuss the traitor   Sossibility  with  Hawat?”  Paul
asked.
   The  Duke  stoSSed across Irom his  son,  sSoke to the  dark  windows.
“We’ve discussed the Sossibility many times.”
   “The  old woman seemed so sure oI herselI,” Paul said. “And the messaJe
Mother—”
   “Precautions  have been taken,”  the Duke  said. He  looked  around the
room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his Iather’s  eyes. “Remain
here. There are some thinJs about the command Sosts I want to discuss with
ThuIir.”  He  turned, strode out  oI  the room,  noddinJ shortly  to  the door
Juards.
   Paul stared at the Slace where his Iather had stood. The sSace had been
emSty even beIore the Duke leIt the room. And he recalled the old woman’s
warninJ: “… Ior  the Iather, nothinJ.”

115
        On that first day when Muad‘Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of
        the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout:
        “Mahdi!”  But their shout was more a Tuestion than a statement, for as yet they could only
        hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their
        attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and
        it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.
                                                             —from “Manual of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
  THE DUKE   Iound   ThuIir   Hawat   alone  in  the  corner  room   to which   a  Juard
directed    him.   There    was  the   sound    oI   men   settinJ    uS  communications
eTuiSment   in  an adMoininJ  room,   but   this  Slace  was  Iairly    Tuiet.  The  Duke
Jlanced  around   as Hawat   arose  Irom  a  SaSer-cluttered   table.  It  was  a Jreen-
walled   enclosure   with,   in  addition    to the  table,   three  susSensor  chairs   Irom
which   the Harkonnen    “H”     had  been  hastily   removed,   leavinJ    an imSerIect
color  Satch.
    “The   chairs   are   liberated   but   Tuite   saIe,”   Hawat   said.   “Where    is  Paul,
Sire?”
    “I    leIt   him    in   the   conIerence    room.    I’m    hoSinJ    he’ll    Jet   some   rest
without   me  there to  distract   him.”
    Hawat    nodded,   crossed   to   the   door   to   the  adMoininJ   room,    closed   it,
shuttinJ   oII  the  noise  oI static   and electronic    sSarkinJ.
    “ThuIir,”      Leto   said,   “the    ImSerial    and   Harkonnen    stockSiles    oI   sSice
attract  my  attention.”
    “M’Lord?”
    The  Duke    Sursed  his  liSs.   “Storehouses    are  susceStible   to  destruction.”
He  raised  a  hand  as  Hawat   started  to  sSeak.  “IJnore    the  EmSeror’s    hoard.
He’d   secretly   enMoy it   iI   the  Harkonnens    were   embarrassed.   And   can   the
Baron  obMect iI   somethinJ    is destroyed    which   he  cannot  oSenly   admit   that
he has?”
    Hawat   shook  his  head. “We’ve    Iew  men  to  sSare, Sire.”
    “Use   some   oI   Idaho’s    men.   And   SerhaSs  some   oI   the   Fremen   would
enMoy a triS oII  Slanet.   A  raid  on  Giedi  Prime—there     are tactical   advantaJes
to such  a diversion,    ThuIir.”
    “As   you  say,  my  Lord.”    Hawat   turned  away,   and  the Duke   saw  evidence
oI  nervousness  in  the  old   man,  thouJht:   Perhaps   he  suspects  I  distrust   him.

116
He must  know  I’ve  private  reports  of  traitors.   Well-best Tuiet  hisfears
immediately.
   “ThuIir,”   he  said, “since you’re  one oI  the Iew  I  can trust comSletely,
there’s another matter  bears discussion. We both  know  how  constant a
watch we must keeS to Srevent traitors Irom inIiltratinJ  our Iorces… but I
have two new reSorts.”
   Hawat turned, stared at him.
   And  Leto reSeated the stories Paul had brouJht.
   Instead oI brinJinJ  on the intense Mentat concentration, the reSorts only
increased Hawat’s aJitation.
   Leto  studied  the old  man  and, Sresently, said: “You’ve   been holdinJ
somethinJ back,  old  Iriend.   I  should’ve  susSected when  you  were  so
nervous durinJ StaII. What is it that was too hot to dumS in Iront oI the Iull
conIerence?”
   Hawat’s saSho-stained liSs were Sulled into a Srim, straiJht line with tiny
wrinkles radiatinJ into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiIIness as he
said: “My Lord, I  don’t Tuite know how to broach this.”
   “We’ve  suIIered many a scar Ior each other, ThuIir,” the Duke said. “You
know you can broach any subMect with me.”
   Hawat  continued to stare at him,  thinkinJ:  This is  how I  like him  best.
This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service.
Why must I hurt him?
   “Well?”  Leto demanded.
   Hawat  shruJJed. “It’s  a scraS oI a  note. We took it  Irom  a Harkonnen
courier. The note  was intended Ior  an aJent named Pardee. We’ve Jood
reason to believe Pardee was toS man in the Harkonnen underJround here.
The  note—it’s    a  thinJ    that   could   have  Jreat   conseTuence or   no
conseTuence. It’s susceStible to various interSretations.”
   “What’s  the delicate content oI this note?”
   “ScraS oI  a note, my Lord. IncomSlete. It was on minimic  Iilm  with  the
usual destruction caSsule attached. We stoSSed the acid action Must short oI
Iull  erasure, leavinJ only a IraJment. The IraJment, however, is e[tremely
suJJestive.”
   “Yes?”
   Hawat  rubbed at his liSs. “It  says: ‘… eto will   never susSect, and when
the blow  Ialls  on  him  Irom  a beloved  hand, its  source alone should be

117
enouJh to destroy him.’ The note was under the Baron’s own seal and I’ve
authenticated the seal.”
   “Your  susSicion is obvious,”  the Duke said and his voice was suddenly
cold.
   “I’d   sooner cut oII my arms than hurt you,” Hawat said. “My  Lord, what
iI….”
   “The   Lady   Jessica,” Leto   said, and  he  Ielt   anJer  consuminJ  him.
“Couldn’t you wrinJ  the Iacts out oI this Pardee?”
   “UnIortunately,   Pardee  no  lonJer   was  amonJ  the  livinJ    when  we
interceSted the courier. The  courier, I’m   certain, did  not  know  what  he
carried.”
   “I  see.”
   Leto  shook his  head, thinkinJ:  What  a slimy  piece of  business. There
can’t be anything in it. I know my woman.
   “My  Lord,  iI—”
   “No!”   the Duke barked. “There’s a mistake here that—”
   “We cannot iJnore it, my Lord.”
   “She’s   been  with   me   Ior   si[teen   years!  There’ve   been  countless
oSSortunities Ior—You yourselI investiJated the school and the woman!”
   Hawat sSoke bitterly: “ThinJs have been known to escaSe me.”
   “It’s  imSossible, I tell you!  The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides
line—meaninJ  Paul, too.  They’ve   already  tried  once. Could  a  woman
consSire aJainst her own son?”
   “PerhaSs she doesn’t consSire aJainst her son. And yesterday’s attemSt
could’ve been a clever sham.”
   “It  couldn’t  have been a sham.”
   “Sire,  she isn’t  suSSosed to know her SarentaJe, but what  iI  she does
know? What iI she were an orShan, say, orShaned by an Atreides?”
   “She’d  have moved lonJ beIore now. Poison in  my drink…  a stiletto  at
niJht. Who has had better oSSortunity?”
   “The  Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not  Must
to kill. There’s a ranJe oI Iine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work oI
art amonJ vendettas.”
   The Duke’s shoulders slumSed. He closed his eyes, lookinJ old and tired.
It cannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.
   “What  better way  to destroy me than to  sow susSicion oI the woman I
love?” he asked.

118
   “An  interSretation I’ve considered,” Hawat said. “Still….”
   The  Duke   oSened his  eyes, stared  at  Hawat,  thinkinJ:   Let  him  be
suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe
this, that will make another man careless.
   “What  do you suJJest?” the Duke whisSered.
   “For  now, constant surveillance, my Lord.  She should be watched at all
times. I will  see it’s done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice Ior
the Mob. PerhaSs in a week or so we can brinJ him back. There’s a younJ
man we’ve been traininJ in Idaho’s trooS who miJht be ideal to send to the
Fremen as a reSlacement. He’s JiIted in diSlomacy.”
   “Don’t  MeoSardize our Ioothold with the Fremen.”
   “OI  course not, Sir.”
   “And  what about Paul?”
   “PerhaSs we could alert Dr. Yueh.”
   Leto turned his back on Hawat. “I leave it in your hands.”
   “I  shall use discretion, my Lord.”
   At  least I  can count on  that, Leto  thouJht. And  he said: “I  will   take a
walk. II you need me, I’ll be within  the Serimeter. The Juard can—”
   “My   Lord,  beIore you Jo,  I’ve  a IilmcliS   you should read. It’s  a Iirst-
aSSro[imation analysis on the Fremen reliJion. You’ll  recall you asked me
to reSort on it.”
   The Duke Saused, sSoke without turninJ. “Will it not wait?”
   “OI  course, my Lord. You asked what they were shoutinJ, thouJh. It was
‘Mahdi!’  They directed the term at the younJ master. When they—”
   “At  Paul?”
   “Yes,  my  Lord.  They’ve  a leJend here, a  SroShecy, that a leader will
come to them, child  oI  a Bene Gesserit, to lead them  to true Ireedom.  It
Iollows the Iamiliar messiah Sattern.”
   “They  think Paul is this… this….”
   “They  only hoSe, my Lord.” Hawat e[tended a IilmcliS caSsule.
   The Duke acceSted it, thrust it into a Socket. “I’ll look at it later.”
   “Certainly,  my Lord.”
   “RiJht  now, I need time to … think.”
   “Yes, my Lord.”
   The Duke  took a deeS siJhinJ breath, strode out the door. He turned to
his riJht down the hall, beJan walkinJ,  hands behind his back, SayinJ little

119
attention to where he  was. There were corridors  and stairs and balconies
and halls… SeoSle who saluted and stood aside Ior him.
   In  time  he came back to  the conIerence room, Iound  it  dark and Paul
asleeS on the table with a Juard’s robe thrown over him and a ditty Sack Ior
a Sillow. The Duke walked soItly down the lenJth oI the room and onto the
balcony overlookinJ the landinJ Iield. A  Juard at the corner oI the balcony,
recoJnizinJ the Duke by the dim reIlection oI liJhts Irom  the Iield, snaSSed
to attention.
   “At   ease,” the Duke murmured. He leaned aJainst the cold metal oI the
balcony rail.
   A  Sredawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked uS. StraiJht
overhead, the stars were a seTuin shawl IlunJ over blue-black. Low on the
southern horizon, the niJht’s second moon Seered throuJh a thin dust haze
—an unbelievinJ moon that looked at him with a cynical liJht.
   As  the Duke watched, the moon  diSSed beneath the Shield Wall cliIIs,
IrostinJ  them, and in  the sudden intensity  oI darkness, he e[Serienced a
chill. He shivered.
   AnJer  shot throuJh him.
   The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last
time, he thouJht. They are dung heaps with village  provost minds! Here I
make my stand! And he thouJht with  a touch oI  sadness: I must rule with
eye and claw—asthe hawk  among lesser birds.  Unconsciously, his  hand
brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.
   To  the  east, the niJht  Jrew  a  IaJJot  oI  luminous  Jray, then  seashell
oSalescence that dimmed  the  stars.  There  came the  lonJ,   bell-tollinJ
movement oI dawn strikinJ across a broken horizon.
   It  was a scene oI such beauty it cauJht all his attention.
   Some things beggar likeness, he thouJht.
   He  had  never  imaJined  anythinJ  here could  be  as beautiIul  as  that
shattered red horizon and the SurSle and ochre cliIIs. Beyond the landinJ
Iield where the niJht’s  Iaint dew had touched liIe into  the hurried seeds oI
Arrakis, he saw Jreat Suddles oI red blooms and, runninJ throuJh them, an
articulate tread oI violet… like Jiant IootsteSs.
   “It’s  a beautiIul morninJ, Sire,” the Juard said.
   “Yes, it  is.”
   The  Duke  nodded, thinkinJ:  Perhaps  this  planet could  grow  on  one.
Perhaps it could become a good home for my son.

120
   Then he saw the human IiJures movinJ  into the Ilower  Iields, sweeSinJ
them with  stranJe scythe-like devices—dew Jatherers. Water so Srecious
here that even the dew must be collected.
   And it could be a hideous place, the Duke thouJht.

121
        “Thereis probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you
        discover your father is a man—with human flesh.”
                                            —from“Collected SayinJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  THE DUKE SAID:   “Paul,  I’m   doinJ  a hateIul  thinJ,  but  I must.”  He  stood
beside  the   Sortable   Soison   snooSer   that   had   been   brouJht   into    the
conIerence room   Ior  their  breakIast.  The  thinJ’s  sensor  arms hunJ  limSly
over the table, remindinJ   Paul oI  some weird insect  newly  dead.
    The Duke’s   attention  was directed  out  the  windows   at the  landinJ  Iield
and its roilinJ   oI dust aJainst  the morninJ  sky.
    Paul had a  viewer  in  Iront  oI  him  containinJ  a short  IilmcliS   on  Fremen
reliJious  Sractices.  The cliS  had been  comSiled  by one  oI  Hawat’s  e[Serts
and Paul Iound himselI   disturbed by  the reIerences to himselI.
    “Mahdi!”
    “Lisan  al-Gaib!”
    He could   close his  eyes and  recall  the  shouts oI  the  crowds.  So  that  is
what  they hope,  he  thouJht.  And   he  remembered  what  the  old  Reverend
Mother  had said:  Kwisatz  Haderach.  The memories  touched  his IeelinJs  oI
terrible  SurSose, shadinJ  this  stranJe  world   with  sensations  oI  Iamiliarity
that he could not  understand.
    “A  hateIul  thinJ,”  the Duke  said.
    “What  do you  mean, sir?”
    Leto  turned,  looked  down  at his  son. “Because  the  Harkonnens  think  to
trick  me  by   makinJ  me  distrust   your  mother.   They  don’t   know  that   I’d
sooner distrust myselI.”
    “I  don’t  understand, sir.”
    AJain,  Leto  looked  out the  windows.  The  white  sun was well   uS into  its
morninJ   Tuadrant.  Milky    liJht   Sicked  out   a boilinJ    oI  dust  clouds   that
sSilled over into  the blind  canyons interIinJerinJ    the Shield  Wall.
    Slowly,  sSeakinJ in  a slow voice  to contain  his anJer, the Duke  e[Slained
to Paul about the mysterious  note.
    “You  miJht  Must as well mistrust me,” Paul said.
    “They  have to think  they’ve  succeeded,”  the Duke said. “They   must think
me this much  oI  a Iool.  It  must look  real.  Even your  mother  may  not know

122
the sham.”
   “But,  sir! Why?”
   “Your   mother’s resSonse must not  be an  act. Oh,  she’s caSable oI  a
suSreme act… but too much rides on this. I hoSe to smoke out a traitor. It
must seem that I’ve been comSletely cozened. She must be hurt this way
that she does not suIIer Jreater hurt.”
   “Why  do you tell me, Father? Maybe I’ll Jive it  away.”
   “They’ll   not  watch you  in this  thinJ,”  the Duke  said. “You’ll   keeS the
secret. You must.” He walked to the windows, sSoke without turninJ. “This
way, iI  anythinJ  should haSSen to me, you can tell  her  the truth—that  I
never doubted her, not Ior the smallest instant. I should want  her to know
this.”
   Paul recoJnized the death thouJhts in his Iather’s words, sSoke Tuickly:
“NothinJ’s JoinJ  to haSSen to you, sir. The—”
   “Be  silent, Son.”
   Paul  stared at his Iather’s  back, seeinJ the  IatiJue in  the  anJle oI  the
neck, in the line oI the shoulders, in the slow movements.
   “You’re  Must tired, Father.”
   “I   am  tired,”   the Duke  aJreed.  “I’m   morally   tired.  The  melancholy
deJeneration oI the Great Houses has aIIlicted me at last, SerhaSs. And we
were such stronJ SeoSle once.”
   Paul sSoke in Tuick anJer: “Our House hasn’t deJenerated!”
   “Hasn’t  it?”
   The Duke turned, Iaced his son, revealinJ dark circles beneath hard eyes,
a cynical twist oI mouth. “I should wed your mother, make her my Duchess.
Yet… my unwedded state Jive some Houses hoSe they may yet ally  with
me throuJh their marriaJeable dauJhters.” He shruJJed. “So, I….”
   “Mother  has e[Slained this to me.”
   “NothinJ  wins more loyalty  Ior a leader than an air oI bravura,” the Duke
said. “I, thereIore, cultivate an air oI bravura.”
   “You   lead well,”   Paul Srotested. “You  Jovern  well.  Men  Iollow   you
willinJly  and love you.”
   “My   SroSaJanda corSs is one oI the  Iinest,”  the Duke’said. AJain,  he
turned to stare out at the basin. “There’s Jreater Sossibility Ior  us here on
Arrakis than the  ImSerium could ever susSect. Yet sometimes I think it’d
have been better iI we’d  run Ior  it,  Jone reneJade. Sometimes I wish we

123
could sink  back into  anonymity amonJ  the SeoSle, become less e[Sosed
to….”
   “Father!”
   “Yes,  I  am  tired,”  the  Duke  said. “Did   you  know  we’re  usinJ  sSice
residue as raw material and already have our own  Iactory to  manuIacture
Iilmbase?”
   “Sir?”
   “We  mustn’t run short oI Iilmbase,”  the Duke said. “Else, how could we
Ilood villaJe   and city  with  our inIormation?  The SeoSle must learn how
well I Jovern them. How would they know iI  we didn’t tell them?”
   “You  should Jet some rest,” Paul said.
   AJain,  the Duke Iaced his son. “Arrakis  has another advantaJe I almost
IorJot to mention.  SSice is in everythinJ here. You breathe it and eat it  in
almost everythinJ. And I Iind that this imSarts a certain natural immunity to
some oI the most common  Soisons oI the Assassins’ Handbook. And the
need to watch every droS oI water Suts all Iood Sroduction—yeast culture,
hydroSonics, chemavit, everythinJ—under  the  strictest  surveillance. We
cannot kill   oII  larJe  seJments oI  our  SoSulation with   Soison—and we
cannot be attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.”
   Paul started to sSeak, but the Duke cut him oII,  sayinJ: “I  have to have
someone I can say these thinJs to, Son.” He siJhed, Jlanced back at the dry
landscaSe where even the Ilowers were Jone now—tramSled by  the dew
Jatherers, wilted under the early sun.
   “On  Caladan, we ruled with sea and air Sower,” the Duke said. “Here, we
must scrabble Ior desert Sower. This is your  inheritance, Paul. What is to
become oI you iI anythinJ haSSens to me? You’ll not be a reneJade House,
but a Juerrilla House—runninJ, hunted.”
   Paul JroSed Ior words, could  Iind nothinJ  to say. He had never seen his
Iather this desSondent.
   “To  hold Arrakis,”  the Duke said, “one  is Iaced with decisions that may
cost one his selI-resSect.” He Sointed out the window to the Atreides Jreen
and black banner hanJinJ  limSly  Irom  a staII at  the edJe oI  the landinJ
Iield. “That honorable banner could come to mean many evil thinJs.”
   Paul swallowed in a dry throat. His Iather’s words carried Iutility, a sense
oI Iatalism that leIt the boy with an emSty IeelinJ in his chest.
   The Duke took an antiIatiJue tablet Irom  a Socket, JulSed it dry. “Power
and Iear,” he said. “The  tools oI statecraIt. I  must order new emShasis on

124
Juerrilla    traininJ    Ior     you.    That    IilmcliS     there—they   call     you
‘Mahdi’—‘Lisan  al-Gaib’—as a last resort, you miJht caSitalize on that.”
   Paul stared at his Iather, watchinJ  the shoulders straiJhten as the tablet
did its work, but rememberinJ the words oI Iear and doubt.
   “What’s  keeSinJ that  ecoloJist?”  the Duke muttered.  “I  told  ThuIir  to
have him here early.”

125
        My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my
        mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-
        likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong resemblance between them—my father
        and this man in the portrait—bothwith thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by
        cold eyes. “Princess daughter,” my father said, “I would that you’d been older when it came
        time for this man to choose a woman.” My father was 71 at the time and looking no older than
        the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember deducing in that instant that my
        father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that
        made them enemies.
                                                                         —“In my Father’s House” by Princess Irulan



 
  HIS FIRST  encounter   with   the SeoSle  he had  been  ordered  to  betray  leIt   Dr.
Kynes  shaken.  He  Srided  himselI   on  beinJ   a scientist   to whom   leJends  were
merely   interestinJ    clues,   SointinJ   toward    cultural   roots.   Yet  the   boy  Iitted
the ancient   SroShecy  so Srecisely.   He  had “the   TuestinJ   eyes,”  and  the air  oI
“reserved   candor.”
    OI   course,   the  SroShecy   leIt   certain    latitude   as  to   whether   the  Mother
Goddess  would    brinJ   the  Messiah   with   her   or  Sroduce  Him    on  the  scene.
Still,  there  was  this  odd  corresSondence   between   Srediction   and  Sersons.
    They     met     in    midmorninJ        outside     the    Arrakeen       landinJ     Iield’s
administration       buildinJ.       An     unmarked      ornithoSter      sTuatted     nearby.
humminJ    soItly    on   standby   like    a  somnolent    insect.   An    Atreides    Juard
stood  beside   it   with    bared   sword   and   the  Iaint    air-distortion     oI   a  shield
around  him.
    Kynes   sneered  at  the  shield   Sattern,  thinkinJ:     Arrakis   has  a  surprise   for
them there!
    The   SlanetoloJist    raised   a  hand,   siJnaled    Ior   his  Fremen   Juard    to  Iall
back.  He  strode   on ahead  toward    the buildinJ’s     entrance—the    dark   hole  in
Slastic-coated    rock.   So  e[Sosed,    that  monolithic     buildinJ,     he  thouJht.    So
much  less suitable   than  a cave.
    Movement    within    the   entrance   cauJht   his  attention.    He  stoSSed,  takinJ
the moment   to  adMust his robe and  the  set oI  his stillsuit    at the  leIt  shoulder.
    The  entrance   doors  swunJ   wide.   Atreides    Juards  emerJed   swiItly,    all   oI
them  heavily   armed-slow-Sellet      stunners,  swords   and  shields.   Behind   them
came  a tall   man,  hawk-Iaced,    dark  oI  skin   and  hair.  He  wore   a Mubba cloak
with   Atreides    crest   at  the  breast,   and  wore   it   in  a  way   that   betrayed   his

126
unIamiliarity  with  the Jarment. It  clunJ  to the leJs oI  his stillsuit   on one
side. It lacked a Iree-swinJinJ, stridinJ rhythm.
   Beside the man walked a youth  with  the same dark hair, but rounder in
the Iace. The youth seemed small Ior the IiIteen years Kynes knew him to
have. But the younJ body carried a sense oI command, a Soised assurance,
as thouJh he saw and knew thinJs all  around him that were not visible  to
others. And he wore the same style cloak as his Iather, yet with casual ease
that made one think the boy had always worn such clothinJ.
   “The   Mahdi  will   be  aware of  things  others  cannot  see, ”  went  the
SroShecy.
   Kynes shook his head, tellinJ himselI: They’re just people.
   With   the  two,  Jarbed like   them  Ior  the  desert, came  a man  Kynes
recoJnized—Gurney  Halleck.  Kynes   took   a  deeS breath   to  still   his
resentment aJainst Halleck, who had brieIed him on how to behave with the
Duke and ducal heir.
   “You  may call the Duke ‘my Lord’ or ‘Sire.’  ‘Noble Born’  also is correct,
but usually reserved for moreformal occasions. The son may be addressed
as ‘young Master’  or ‘my Lord.’  The Duke is a man of  much leniency, but
brooks little familiarity.
   And  Kynes thouJht as he watched the JrouS aSSroach: They’ll learn soon
enough who’s master on Arrakis. Order me Tuestioned half the night by that
Mentat, will   they?  Expect me to  guide  them on  an  inspection  of spice
mining, do they?
   The  imSort oI  Hawat’s Tuestions had not escaSed Kynes. They wanted
the ImSerial bases. And it  was obvious  they’d learned oI  the bases Irom
Idaho.
   I  will have Stilgar send Idaho’s head to this Duke, Kynes told himselI.
   The ducal Sarty was only a Iew Saces away now, their Ieet in desert boots
crunchinJ the sand.
   Kynes bowed. “My  Lord, Duke.”
   As  he had aSSroached the solitary IiJure standinJ near the ornithoSter,
Leto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed Ior the desert in loose robe, stillsuit,
and low boots. The man’s hood  was thrown back, its  veil  hanJinJ to one
side, revealinJ   lonJ  sandy  hair,  a   sSarse beard. The  eyes  were  that
Iathomless blue-within-blue  under  thick  brows.  Remains oI  dark  stains
smudJed his eye sockets.
   “You’re  the ecoloJist,” the Duke said.

127
   “We SreIer the old title here, my Lord,” Kynes said. “PlanetoloJist.”
   “As  you wish,”  the Duke said. He Jlanced down at Paul. “Son, this is the
JudJe oI the ChanJe, the arbiter oI disSute, the man set here to see that the
Iorms are obeyed in our assumStion oI Sower over this IieI.” He Jlanced at
Kynes. “And this is my son.”
   “My  Lord,”  Kynes said.
   “Are  you a Fremen?” Paul asked.
   Kynes  smiled. “I  am acceSted in both sietch and villaJe, younJ Master.
But I am in His MaMesty’s service, the ImSerial PlanetoloJist.”
   Paul nodded, imSressed by the man’s air oI strenJth. Halleck had Sointed
Kynes out to  Paul Irom  an uSSer window oI  the administration buildinJ:
“The  man standinJ there  with  the Fremen escort—the one  movinJ  now
toward the ornithoSter.”
   Paul  had  insSected Kynes  brieIly   with   binoculars,  notinJ  the  Srim,
straiJht mouth, the hiJh Iorehead. Halleck had sSoken in Paul’s ear: “Odd
sort oI Iellow. Has a Srecise way oI sSeakinJ—cliSSed oII, no Iuzzy edJes
—razor-aSt.”
   And  the Duke, behind them, had said: “Scientist tySe.”
   Now, only  a Iew Ieet Irom the man, Paul sensed the Sower in Kynes, the
imSact oI Sersonality, as thouJh he were blood royal, born to command.
   “I   understand we have you to thank Ior our  stillsuits and these cloaks,”
the Duke said.
   “I   hoSe they Iit well,  my Lord,”  Kynes  said. “They’re  oI Fremen make
and as near as Sossible the  dimensions Jiven  me by  your  man Halleck
here.”
   “I  was concerned that you said you couldn’t take us into the desert unless
we wore these Jarments,” the Duke said. “We can carry Slenty oI water. We
don’t intend  to be out  lonJ and  we’ll  have air  cover—the escort you see
overhead riJht now. It isn’t likely we’d be Iorced down.”
   Kynes  stared at him, seeinJ the water-Iat  Ilesh. He sSoke coldly:  “You
never talk oI likelihoods on Arrakis. You sSeak only oI Sossibilities.”
   Halleck stiIIened. “The  Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!”
   Leto  Jave Halleck their Srivate handsiJnal to desist, said: “Our ways are
new here, Gurney. We must make allowances.”
   “As  you wish, Sire.”
   “We  are indebted to  you,  Dr. Kynes,”  Leto  said. “These suits  and the
consideration Ior our welIare will be remembered.”

128
   On  imSulse, Paul called to mind  a Tuotation Irom the O.C.  Bible, said:
“‘The JiIt  is the blessinJ oI the Jiver.’ ”
   The  words ranJ out  overloud in  the still  air. The  Fremen escort Kynes
had leIt  in the  shade oI the administration  buildinJ  leaSed uS Irom their
sTuattinJ reSose, mutterinJ in  oSen aJitation.  One  cried out:  “Lisan  al-
Gaib!”
   Kynes  whirled,  Jave  a curt,  choSSinJ siJnal  with  a hand,  waved the
Juard away. They  Iell  back,  JrumblinJ  amonJ  themselves, trailed away
around the buildinJ.
   “Most  interestinJ,” Leto said.
   Kynes  Sassed a hard Jlare over the Duke and Paul, said: “Most   oI the
desert natives here are a suSerstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They
mean no harm.” But he thouJht oI the words oI the leJend: “They will greet
you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing. ”
   Leto’s assessment oI Kynes—based Sartly on Hawat’s brieI verbal reSort
(Juarded and  Iull   oI   susSicions)—suddenly crystallized:  the  man  was
Fremen. Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simSly
that the Fremen were testinJ their new Ireedom to enter urban areas—but it
had seemed an honor Juard. And by his manner, Kynes was a Sroud man,
accustomed to Ireedom, his tonJue and his manner Juarded only by his own
susSicions. Paul’s Tuestion had been direct and Sertinent.
   Kynes had Jone native.
   “Shouldn’t  we be JoinJ, Sire?” Halleck asked.
   The Duke nodded. “I’ll   Ily  my own ‘thoSter. Kynes can sit uS Iront with
me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats.”
   “One  moment, Slease,” Kynes said. “With your Sermission, Sire, I must
check the security oI your suits.”
   The Duke started to sSeak, but Kynes Sressed on: “I have concern Ior my
own Ilesh as well  as yours  … my  Lord.  I’m  well  aware oI  whose throat
would be slit should harm beIall you two while you’re in my care.”
   The  Duke Irowned,  thinkinJ:  How  delicate this  moment! If  I refuse, it
may offend him.  And this  could be  a man  whose value to me  is beyond
measure. Yet … to let  him inside  my shield,  touching my person  when I
know so little about him?
   The thouJhts Ilicked  throuJh his mind  with decision hard on their heels.
“We’re  in your  hands,”  the Duke  said. He steSSed Iorward, oSeninJ his
robe, saw Halleck come uS on  the balls oI  his Ieet,  Soised and alert, but

129
remaininJ where he was. “And,  iI  you’d  be so kind,”  the Duke  said, “I’d
aSSreciate an e[Slanation oI the suit Irom one who lives so intimately with
it.”
   “Certainly,”  Kynes said. He Ielt  uS under the robe Ior the shoulder seals,
sSeakinJ as he e[amined the suit. “It’s basically a micro-sandwich—a hiJh-
eIIiciency Iilter  and heat-e[chanJe system.” He adMusted the shoulder seals.
“The  skin-contact layer’s  Sorous. PersSiration Sasses throuJh it,  havinJ
cooled  the   body…   near-normal  evaSoration  Srocess. The   ne[t   two
layers…”   Kynes  tiJhtened  the   chest  Iit.   “…   include   heat  e[chanJe
Iilaments and salt SreciSitators. Salt’s reclaimed.”
   The Duke liIted  his arms at a Jesture, said: “Most interestinJ.”
   “Breathe deeSly,” Kynes said.
   The Duke obeyed.
   Kynes  studied the underarm seals, adMusted one. “Motions oI the body,
esSecially breathinJ,”   he said,  “and   some osmotic  action   Srovide the
SumSinJ Iorce.”   He  loosened the  chest  Iit  sliJhtly.   “Reclaimed  water
circulates to catchSockets Irom which you draw it  throuJh this tube in  the
cliS at your neck.”
   The  Duke twisted his  chin in  and down to  look at  the end oI the  tube.
“EIIicient  and convenient,” he said. “Good enJineerinJ.”
   Kynes  knelt, e[amined  the leJ seals. “Urine  and Ieces are Srocessed in
the thiJh Sads,” he said, and stood uS, Ielt the neck IittinJ, liIted a sectioned
IlaS there. “In  the oSen desert, you wear this  Iilter  across your Iace, this
tube in the nostrils with these SluJs to insure a tiJht Iit. Breathe in throuJh
the mouth Iilter,  out  throuJh  the nose tube. With  a Fremen suit  in  Jood
workinJ order, you won’t  lose more than a thimbleIul  oI moisture a day—
even iI you’re cauJht in the Great ErJ.”
   “A  thimbleIul  a day,” the Duke said.
   Kynes  Sressed a IinJer aJainst the suit’s Iorehead Sad, said: “This may
rub a  little.  II   it  irritates  you, Slease tell  me. I  could  slit-Satch  it  a bit
tiJhter.”
   “My  thanks,” the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes
steSSed back, realizinJ   that  it   did   Ieel  better  now—tiJhter   and  less
irritatinJ.
   Kynes turned to Paul. “Now, let’s have a look at you, lad.”
   A  good man  but he’ll   have to learn  to  address us properly, the  Duke
thouJht.

130
   Paul  stood Sassively as Kynes  insSected the suit. It  had  been an odd
sensation  SuttinJ   on   the   crinklinJ,    slick-surIaced   Jarment.   In   his
Ioreconsciousness had been the  absolute knowledJe  that  he had  never
beIore worn  a stillsuit.   Yet, each motion  oI  adMustinJ the adhesion tabs
under Gurney’s ine[Sert Juidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he
had tiJhtened the chest to Jain ma[imum SumSinJ action Irom the motion
oI breathinJ, he had known what  he did and why. When  he had Iitted the
neck and Iorehead tabs tiJhtly,   he had known  it  was to  Srevent Iriction
blisters.
   Kynes  straiJhtened, steSSed back with  a Suzzled e[Sression. “You’ve
worn a stillsuit beIore?” he asked.
   “This  is the Iirst time.”
   “Then  someone adMusted it Ior you?”
   “No.”
   “Your  desert boots are Iitted sliS-Iashion at the ankles. Who told you  to
do that?”
   “It…  seemed the riJht way.”
   “That  it most certainly is.”
   And  Kynes  rubbed his cheek, thinkinJ  oI  the  leJend: “He  shall  know
your ways as though born to them. ”
   “We  waste time,” the Duke said. He Jestured to the waitinJ ‘thoSter, led
the way, acceStinJ the Juard’s salute with a nod.  He climbed in,  Iastened
his saIety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craIt creaked as
the others clambered aboard.
   Kynes Iastened his harness, Iocused on the Sadded comIort oI the aircraIt
—soIt lu[ury  oI Jray-Jreen uSholstery, JleaminJ instruments, the sensation
oI Iiltered  and  washed air in  his  lunJs as  doors slammed and vent  Ians
whirred alive.
   So soft! he thouJht.
   “All   secure, Sire,” Halleck said.
   Leto  Ied Sower to the winJs,  Ielt them cuS and diS—once, twice. They
were airborne in ten meters, winJs Ieathered tiJhtly  and aIterMets thrustinJ
them uSward in a steeS, hissinJ climb.
   “Southeast over the Shield Wall,”  Kynes said. “That’s where I  told your
sandmaster to concentrate his eTuiSment.”
   “RiJht.”

131
   The Duke banked into his air  cover, the other craIt takinJ uS their Juard
Sositions as they headed southeast.
   “The  desiJn and manuIacture oI these stillsuits besSeaks a hiJh deJree oI
soShistication,” the Duke said.
   “Someday I may show you a sietch Iactory,” Kynes said.
   “I   would  Iind  that  interestinJ,”  the  Duke  said. “I   note  that suits  are
manuIactured also in some oI the Jarrison cities.”
   “InIerior  coSies,” Kynes said. “Any Dune man who values his skin wears
a Fremen suit.”
   “And  it’ll  hold your water loss to a thimbleIul a day?”
   “ProSerly  suited, your Iorehead caS tiJht, all  seals in order, your maMor
water loss is throuJh the Salms oI your hands,” Kynes said. “You can wear
suit Jloves  iI   you’re  not  usinJ  your  hands Ior  critical   work,  but  most
Fremen in the oSen desert rub their hands with Muice Irom the leaves oI the
creosote bush. It inhibits SersSiration.”
   The Duke Jlanced down to the leIt  at the broken landscaSe oI the Shield
Wall—chasms oI tortured rock, Satches oI yellow-brown crossed by black
lines oI Iault shatterinJ. It was as thouJh someone had droSSed this Jround
Irom sSace and leIt it where it smashed.
   They   crossed a  shallow  basin  with   the  clear  outline  oI   Jray  sand
sSreadinJ across it Irom a canyon oSeninJ to the  south. The sand IinJers
ran out into the basin—a dry delta outlined aJainst darker rock.
   Kynes sat back, thinkinJ about the water-Iat Ilesh he had Ielt beneath the
stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow Sellet stunners at the
waist, coin-sized emerJency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both
the Duke  and his  son carried knives  in  wrist  sheathes and the sheathes
aSSeared well worn. The SeoSle struck Kynes as a stranJe combination oI
soItness and armed strenJth. There was a Soise to them totally unlike the
Harkonnens.
   “When  you reSort to the EmSeror on the chanJe oI Jovernment here, will
you say we observed the rules?” Leto asked. He Jlanced at Kynes, back to
their course.
   “The  Harkonnens leIt; you came,” Kynes said.
   “And  is everythinJ as it should be?” Leto asked.
   Momentary  tension showed in the tiJhteninJ  oI  a muscle alonJ Kynes’
Maw. “As PlanetoloJist and JudJe oI the ChanJe, I am a direct subMect oI the
ImSerium… my Lord.”

132
   The Duke smiled Jrimly. “But  we both know the realities.”
   “I  remind you that His MaMesty suSSorts my work.”
   “Indeed? And what is your work?”
   In  the brieI silence, Paul thouJht: He’s pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul
Jlanced at Halleck, but  the minstrel-warrior  was starinJ out  at the barren
landscaSe.
   Kynes sSoke stiIIly: “You, oI  course, reIer to my duties as SlanetoloJist.”
   “OI  course.”
   “It  is mostly dry  land bioloJy and botany… some JeoloJical work—core
drillinJ  and testinJ. You  never really e[haust the  Sossibilities oI an entire
Slanet.”
   “Do  you also investiJate the sSice?”
   Kynes  turned,  and Paul  noted the  hard line   oI  the man’s  cheek. “A
curious Tuestion, my Lord.”
   “Bear  in mind, Kynes,  that this is now my IieI.  My  methods diIIer Irom
those oI the Harkonnens. I  don’t  care iI you  study the sSice as lonJ  as I
share  what   you   discover.”   He   Jlanced   at   the  SlanetoloJist.   “The
Harkonnens discouraJed investiJation oI the sSice, didn’t they?”
   Kynes stared back without answerinJ.
   “You  may sSeak Slainly,” the Duke said, “without Iear Ior your skin.”
   “The  ImSerial Court is, indeed, a lonJ way oII,” Kynes muttered. And he
thouJht: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool
enough to enlist with him?
   The Duke chuckled, keeSinJ his attention on their course. “I detect a sour
note in your voice, sir. We’ve waded in  here with our mob oI  tame killers,
eh? And we e[Sect you to realize immediately that we’re diIIerent Irom the
Harkonnens?”
   “I’ve  seen the SroSaJanda you’ve Ilooded into sietch and villaJe,” Kynes
said. “‘Love the Jood Duke!’ Your corSs oI—”
   “Here  now!”   Halleck barked. He  snaSSed his attention away Irom  the
window, leaned Iorward.
   Paul Sut a hand on Halleck’s arm.
   “Gurney!”   the Duke said. He Jlanced back. “This man’s been lonJ under
the Harkonnens.”
   Halleck sat back. “Ayah.”
   “Your  man Hawat’s subtle,” Kynes said, “but his obMect’s Slain enouJh.”
   “Will   you oSen those bases to us, then?” the Duke asked.

133
   Kynes sSoke curtly: “They’re His MaMesty’s SroSerty.”
   “They’re  not beinJ used.”
   “They  could be used.”
   “Does His MaMesty concur?”
   Kynes  darted a hard stare at the Duke. “Arrakis  could be an Eden iI  its
rulers would look uS Irom JrubbinJ Ior sSice!”
   He didn’t  answer my Tuestion, the Duke thouJht. And he said: “How is a
Slanet to become an Eden without money?”
   “What  is money,” Kynes asked, “iI it won’t buy the services you need?”
   Ah,  now!  the Duke  thouJht.  And  he said: “We’ll   discuss this  another
time. RiJht now, I believe we’re cominJ  to the edJe oI the Shield Wall. Do
I hold the same course?”
   “The  same course,” Kynes muttered.
   Paul looked out  his window. Beneath them, the broken Jround beJan to
droS away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock Slain and a kniIe-edJed
shelI. Beyond the shelI, IinJernail  crescents oI dunes marched toward the
horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudJe, a darker blotch to
tell oI  somethinJ not sand. Rock outcroSSinJs, SerhaSs. In the heat-addled
air, Paul couldn’t be sure.
   “Are  there any Slants down there?” Paul asked.
   “Some,”  Kynes said. “This  latitude’s  liIe-zone has mostly what  we call
minor water stealers—adaSted to raidinJ each other Ior moisture, JobblinJ
uS the trace-dew. Some Sarts oI the desert teem with liIe. But all oI  it has
learned how to survive  under these riJors. II  you  Jet cauJht down  there,
you imitate that liIe or you die.”
   “You  mean steal water Irom each other?” Paul asked. The idea outraJed
him, and his voice betrayed his emotion.
   “It’s  done,” Kynes said, “but  that wasn’t Srecisely my meaninJ. You see,
my climate demands a sSecial attitude toward water. You are aware oI water
at all times. You waste nothinJ that contains moisture.”
   And  the Duke thouJht: “… my climate!”
   “Come   around two   deJrees more  southerly, my   Lord,”   Kynes  said.
“There’s a blow cominJ uS Irom the west.”
   The  Duke  nodded. He  had  seen the billowinJ   oI  tan  dust  there. He
banked the ‘thoSter  around, notinJ  the way  the  escort’s winJs  reIlected
milky oranJe Irom the dust-reIracted liJht as they turned to keeS Sace with
him.

134
   “This  should clear the storm’s edJe,” Kynes said.
   “That  sand must be danJerous iI you Ily into it,” Paul said. “Will  it really
cut the stronJest metals?”
   “At  this  altitude, it’s not sand but dust,” Kynes said. “The danJer is lack
oI visibility,  turbulence, cloJJed intakes.”
   “We’ll  see actual sSice mininJ today?” Paul asked.
   “Very  likely,”  Kynes said.
   Paul sat back. He had used the Tuestions and hySerawareness to do what
his mother  called “reJisterinJ”   the Serson. He had  Kynes now—tone  oI
voice, each detail  oI  Iace  and Jesture. An  unnatural  IoldinJ  oI  the  leIt
sleeve on the man’s robe told oI a kniIe in an arm sheath. The waist bulJed
stranJely. It was said that  desert men wore a belted sash into which  they
tucked small  necessities. PerhaSs the bulJes came  Irom  such a  sash—
certainly not Irom  a concealed shield belt. A coSSer Sin enJraved with the
likeness oI a  hare clasSed the neck oI Kynes’  robe. Another  smaller Sin
with similar likeness hunJ at the corner oI the hood which was thrown back
over his shoulders.
   Halleck   twisted  in  the  seat beside  Paul, reached back  into   the rear
comSartment and brouJht out his baliset. Kynes looked around as Halleck
tuned the instrument, then returned his attention to their course.
   “What  would you like to hear, younJ Master?” Halleck asked.
   “You  choose, Gurney,” Paul said.
   Halleck  bent his ear close to the soundinJ board, strummed a chord and
sanJ soItly:

       “Our  Iathers ate manna in the desert, 
       In the burninJ Slaces where whirlwinds came.  
       Lord, save us Irom that horrible land!               
       Save us… oh-h-h-h, save us              
       From the dry and thirsty land.” 

   Kynes Jlanced at the Duke, said: “You do travel with a liJht comSlement
oI Juards, my Lord. Are all oI them such men oI many talents?”
   “Gurney?”  The Duke chuckled. “Gurney’s one oI a kind.  I like  him with
me Ior his eyes. His eyes miss very little.”
   The SlanetoloJist Irowned.
   Without  missinJ a beat in his tune, Halleck interSosed:

135
       “For  I am like an owl oI the desert, o! 
       Aiyah!  am like an owl oI the des-ert!” 

   The Duke  reached down, brouJht uS a microShone Irom the instrument
Sanel, thumbed it to liIe, said: “Leader  to Escort Gemma. FlyinJ  obMect at
nine o’clock, Sector B. Do you identiIy it?”
   “It’s  merely a bird,” Kynes said, and added: “You have sharS eyes.”
   The  Sanel sSeaker crackled, then:  “Escort  Gemma.  ObMect e[amined
under Iull amSliIication. It’s a larJe bird.”
   Paul  looked in  the indicated  direction, saw the  distant sSeck: a dot  oI
intermittent motion,  and realized how keyed uS his Iather must be. Every
sense was at Iull alert.
   “I’d   not realized there were birds that larJe this  Iar into the desert,” the
Duke said.
   “That’s  likely   an eaJle,” Kynes  said. “Many  creatures have adaSted to
this Slace.”
   The  ornithoSter sweSt over a bare rock  Slain. Paul  looked down  Irom
their two thousand meters’ altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow oI their craIt
and escort.  The  land  beneath  seemed Ilat,  but   shadow wrinkles   said
otherwise.
   “Has anyone ever walked out oI the desert?” the Duke asked.
   Halleck’s music stoSSed. He leaned Iorward to catch the answer.
   “Not   Irom the  deeS desert,” Kynes said. “Men  have walked out oI  the
second zone several times. They’ve  survived  by crossinJ  the rock  areas
where worms seldom Jo.”
   The timbre oI  Kynes’ voice held Paul’s attention. He Ielt his  sense come
alert the way they were trained to do.
   “Ah-h,  the worms,” the Duke said. “I must see one sometime.”
   “You  may see one today,” Kynes said. “Wherever there is sSice, there are
worms.”
   “Always?”  Halleck  asked.
   “Always.”
   “Is  there a relationshiS between worm and sSice?” the Duke asked.
   Kynes  turned and  Paul saw the  Sursed liSs as the  man sSoke. “They
deIend sSice sands. Each worm has a—territory.  As  to the  sSice… who
knows? Worm sSecimens we’ve e[amined lead us to susSect comSlicated
chemical interchanJes within them. We Iind  traces oI hydrochloric acid in

136
the  ducts, more  comSlicated  acid  Iorms  elsewhere.  I’ll   Jive   you  my
monoJraSh on the subMect.”
   “And  a shield’s no deIense?” the Duke asked.
   “Shields!”   Kynes sneered. “Activate a shield within  the worm zone and
you seal your Iate. Worms iJnore  territory lines,  come Irom Iar  around to
attack a shield. No man wearinJ a shield has ever survived such attack.”
   “How  are worms taken, then?”
   “HiJh   voltaJe electrical shock aSSlied seSarately to each rinJ seJment is
the only known way oI killinJ   and SreservinJ an entire worm,” Kynes said.
“They can be stunned and shattered by e[Slosives, but each rinJ  seJment
has a liIe  oI  its own.  BarrinJ  atomics, I  know  oI  no e[Slosive  SowerIul
enouJh to destroy a larJe worm entirely. They’re incredibly touJh.”
   “Why  hasn’t an eIIort been made to wiSe them out?” Paul asked.
   “Too  e[Sensive,” Kynes said. “Too much area to cover.”
   Paul  leaned  back  in   his  corner.  His  truthsense,  awareness oI  tone
shadinJs, told him  that  Kynes was  lyinJ  and tellinJ   halI-truths.  And he
thouJht: If   there’s a  relationship  between spice  and worms,  killing   the
worms would destroy the spice.
   “No  one will  have to walk  out oI the desert soon,” the Duke said. “TriS
these little  transmitters at  our  necks and  rescue is  on  its way.  All   our
workers will be wearinJ them beIore lonJ. We’re settinJ uS a sSecial rescue
service.”
   “Very  commendable,” Kynes said.
   “Your  tone says you don’t aJree,” the Duke said.
   “AJree?  OI  course I aJree, but  it won’t  be much  use. Static electricity
Irom sandstorms masks out many siJnals. Transmitters short out. They’ve
been tried here beIore, you know. Arrakis is touJh on eTuiSment. And iI  a
worm’s huntinJ  you there’s not much time. FreTuently, you have no more
than IiIteen or twenty minutes.”
   “What  would you advise?” the Duke asked.
   “You  ask my advice?”
   “As  SlanetoloJist, yes.”
   “You’d  Iollow  my advice?”
   “II  I  Iound it sensible.”
   “Very  well, my Lord. Never travel alone.”
   The Duke turned his attention Irom the controls. “That’s all?”
   “That’s  all. Never travel alone.”

137
   “What  iI  you’re seSarated by a storm and Iorced down?” Halleck asked.
“Isn’t there anythinJ you could do?”
   “Anything  covers much territory,” Kynes said.
   “What  would you do?” Paul asked.
   Kynes  turned a hard stare at the boy,  brouJht his attention  back to the
Duke. “I’d   remember  to  Srotect the inteJrity   oI  my  stillsuit.   II  I  were
outside the worm zone or in rock, I’d  stay with the shiS. II I  were down in
oSen sand, I’d Jet away Irom the shiS as Iast as I could. About a thousand
meters would  be Iar  enouJh. Then  I’d  hide  beneath my  robe. A   worm
would Jet the shiS, but it miJht miss me.”
   “Then  what?” Halleck asked.
   Kynes shruJJed. “Wait Ior the worm to leave.”
   “That’s  all?” Paul asked.
   “When  the worm has Jone, one may try to walk  out,” Kynes  said. “You
must walk soItly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins—head Ior the nearest
rock zone. There are many such zones. You miJht make it.”
   “Drum  sand?” Halleck asked.
   “A  condition  oI sand comSaction,” Kynes said. “The sliJhtest steS sets it
drumminJ. Worms always come to that.”
   “And  a tidal dust basin?” the Duke asked.
   “Certain  deSressions in the desert have Iilled with dust over the centuries.
Some are so vast they have currents and tides. All will swallow the unwary
who steS into them.”
   Halleck sat back, resumed strumminJ the baliset. Presently, he sanJ:

       “Wild  beasts oI the desert do hunt there, 
       WaitinJ Ior  the innocents to Sass.          
       Oh-h-h, temSt not the Jods oI the desert,  
       Lest you seek a lonely eSitaSh.               
       The Serils oI the—” 

   He broke oII, leaned Iorward. “Dust cloud ahead, Sire.”
   “I  see it, Gurney.”
   “That’s  what we seek,” Kynes said.
   Paul stretched uS in  the seat to Seer ahead, saw a rollinJ yellow  cloud
low on the desert surIace some thirty kilometers ahead.

138
   “One  oI your Iactory  crawlers,” Kynes said. “It’s  on the surIace and that
means it’s on sSice. The cloud is vented sand beinJ e[Selled aIter the sSice
has been centriIuJally removed. There’s no other cloud Tuite like it.”
   “AircraIt   over it,” the Duke said.
   “I   see two… three… Iour  sSotters,” Kynes said. “They’re  watchinJ Ior
wormsiJn.”
   “WormsiJn?”  the Duke asked.
   “A  sandwave movinJ toward the crawler. They’ll have seismic Srobes on
the surIace, too. Worms sometimes travel too deeS Ior the wave to show.”
Kynes swunJ his Jaze around the sky. “Should be a carryall  winJ around,
but I don’t see it.”
   “The  worm always comes, eh?” Halleck asked.
   “Always.”
   Paul  leaned Iorward, touched Kynes’  shoulder. “How  biJ  an area does
each worm stake out?”
   Kynes Irowned. The child keSt askinJ adult Tuestions.
   “That  deSends on the size oI the worm.”
   “What’s  the variation?” the Duke asked.
   “BiJ   ones may control  three or  Iour hundred sTuare kilometers. Small
ones—” He broke oII as the Duke kicked on the Met brakes. The shiS bucked
as its tail Sods whisSered to silence. Stub winJs elonJated, cuSSed the air.
The craIt became a Iull ‘thoSter as the Duke banked it, holdinJ the winJs to
a Jentle beat, SointinJ with his leIt  hand oII to the east beyond the Iactory
crawler.
   “Is  that wormsiJn?”
   Kynes leaned across the Duke to Seer into the distance.
   Paul and Halleck  were crowded toJether, lookinJ in  the same direction,
and Paul noted that their escort, cauJht by the sudden maneuver, had surJed
ahead, but now was curvinJ back. The Iactory  crawler lay ahead oI them,
still some three kilometers away.
   Where  the Duke  Sointed, crescent dune tracks  sSread shadow riSSles
toward the horizon and, runninJ throuJh them as a level line stretchinJ into
the distance, came an elonJated mount-in-motion—a  crestinJ oI  sand. It
reminded Paul oI the way  a biJ  Iish disturbed the water  when swimminJ
Must under the surIace.
   “Worm,”    Kynes   said.   “BiJ    one.”   He   leaned  back,   Jrabbed  the
microShone Irom   the  Sanel, Sunched  out  a  new  IreTuency  selection.

139
GlancinJ at  the Jrid  chart on  rollers  over their  heads, he sSoke into the
microShone: “CallinJ   crawler  at  Delta  AMa[ niner.  WormsiJn  warninJ.
Crawler at Delta AMa[ niner. WormsiJn warninJ. AcknowledJe, Slease.” He
waited.
   The Sanel sSeaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: “Who calls Delta
AMa[ niner? Over.”
   “They  seem Sretty calm about it,” Halleck said.
   Kynes  sSoke into the  microShone: “Unlisted  IliJht—north   and east oI
you about three kilometers. WormsiJn is on interceSt course, your Sosition,
estimated contact twenty-Iive minutes.”
   Another   voice  rumbled  Irom  the  sSeaker: “This   is  SSotter Control.
SiJhtinJ  conIirmed. Stand by  Ior  contact Ii[.”    There was a  Sause, then:
“Contact in twenty-si[  minutes minus. That was a sharS estimate. Who’s on
that unlisted IliJht? Over.”
   Halleck  had his harness oII and surJed Iorward between Kynes and the
Duke. “Is this the reJular workinJ IreTuency, Kynes?”
   “Yes. Why?”
   “Who’d  be listeninJ?”
   “Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interIerence.”
   AJain,  the sSeaker crackled, then: “This  is Delta AMa[ niner. Who  Jets
bonus credit Ior that sSot? Over.”
   Halleck Jlanced at the Duke.
   Kynes said: “There’s a bonus based on sSice load Ior whoever Jives Iirst
worm warninJ. They want to know—”
   “Tell  them who had Iirst siJht oI that worm,” Halleck said.
   The Duke nodded.
   Kynes hesitated, then liIted the microShone: “SSotter credit to the Duke
Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over.”
   The  voice Irom  the sSeaker was Ilat and Sartly  distorted by  a burst oI
static: “We read and thank you.”
   “Now,  tell them to divide the bonus amonJ themselves,” Halleck ordered.
“Tell them it’s the Duke’s wish.”
   Kynes took a deeS breath, then: “It’s the Duke’s wish that you divide the
bonus amonJ your crew. Do you read? Over.”
   “AcknowledJed  and thank you,” the sSeaker said.
   The Duke  said: “I  IorJot to mention that Gurney is  also very talented in
Sublic relations.”

140
   Kynes turned a Suzzled Irown on Halleck.
   “This   lets  the  men know   their  Duke  is  concerned Ior  their   saIety,”
Halleck said. “Word will Jet around. It was on an area workinJ IreTuency—
not likely Harkonnen aJents heard.” He Jlanced out at their air cover. “And
we’re a Sretty stronJ Iorce. It was a Jood risk.”
   The  Duke  banked their  craIt  toward the  sandcloud eruStinJ Irom  the
Iactory crawler. “What haSSens now?”
   “There’s  a carryall  winJ  somewhere close,” Kynes said. “It’ll    come in
and liIt oII the crawler.”
   “What  iI the carryall’s wrecked?” Halleck asked.
   “Some eTuiSment is lost,” Kynes said. “Get in close over the crawler, my
Lord; you’ll  Iind this interestinJ.”
   The  Duke scowled, busied himselI  with  the controls as they came into
turbulent air over the crawler.
   Paul  looked down, saw sand still  sSewinJ out  oI the  metal and Slastic
monster beneath them. It looked like a Jreat tan and blue beetle with many
wide tracks e[tendinJ  on  arms around it.  He saw a Jiant  inverted Iunnel
snout Soked into dark sand in Iront oI it.
   “Rich   sSice bed by the color,”  Kynes  said. “They’ll   continue workinJ
until the last minute.”
   The  Duke  Ied more  Sower to  the winJs,  stiIIened them  Ior  a steeSer
descent as he settled lower in a circlinJ Jlide  above the crawler. A  Jlance
leIt and riJht showed his cover holdinJ altitude and circlinJ overhead.
   Paul  studied the yellow  cloud  belchinJ  Irom  the crawler’s  SiSe vents,
looked out over the desert at the aSSroachinJ worm track.
   “Shouldn’t  we be hearinJ them call in the carryall?” Halleck asked.
   “They  usually have the winJ on a diIIerent IreTuency,” Kynes said.
   “Shouldn’t  they  have two carryalls  standinJ by Ior  every crawler?”  the
Duke asked. “There should be twenty-si[ men on that machine down there,
not to mention cost oI eTuiSment.”
   Kynes said: “You don’t have enouJh e[—”
   He broke oII as the sSeaker eruSted with an anJry voice: “Any oI you see
the winJ? He isn’t answerinJ.”
   A   Jarble  oI  noise crackled  Irom  the  sSeaker, drowned in  an  abruSt
override siJnal, then silence and the Iirst  voice:  “ReSort by  the numbers!
Over.”

141
   “This  is SSotter Control. Last I saw, the winJ was Sretty hiJh and circlinJ
oII northwest. I don’t see him now. Over.”
   “SSotter one: neJative. Over.”
   “SSotter two: neJative. Over.”
   “SSotter three: neJative. Over.”
   Silence.
   The  Duke looked down.  His own  craIt’s shadow was Must SassinJ over
the crawler. “Only Iour sSotters, is that riJht?”
   “Correct,”  Kynes said.
   “There  are Iive  in our  Sarty,” the Duke said. “Our  shiSs are larJer. We
can crowd in three e[tra each. Their sSotters ouJht to be able to liIt oII two
each.”
   Paul did the mental arithmetic, said: “That’s three short.”
   “Why  don’t they have two carryalls to each crawler?” barked the Duke.
   “You  don’t have enouJh e[tra eTuiSment,” Kynes said.
   “All   the more reason we should Srotect what we have!”
   “Where could that carryall Jo?”  Halleck asked.
   “Could’ve  been Iorced down somewhere out oI siJht,” Kynes said.
   The Duke Jrabbed the microShone, hesitated with thumb Soised over its
switch. “How could they lose siJht oI a carryall?”
   “They  keeS their attention on the Jround lookinJ  Ior wormsiJn,”  Kynes
said.
   The Duke thumbed the switch, sSoke into the microShone. “This is your
Duke. We are cominJ down to take oII Delta AMa[ niner’s crew. All sSotters
are ordered to comSly. SSotters will land on the east side. We will take the
west. Over.” He reached down, Sunched out his own command IreTuency,
reSeated the order Ior his own  air cover, handed the microShone back to
Kynes.
   Kynes  returned to the workinJ  IreTuency and a  voice blasted Irom  the
sSeaker: “… almost a Iull  load  oI sSice! We have almost a Iull   load! We
can’t leave that Ior a damned worm! Over.”
   “Damn  the sSice!”  the Duke barked. He Jrabbed back the microShone,
said: “We can always Jet more sSice. There are seats in our shiSs Ior all but
three oI you.  Draw  straws or decide any  way you  like  who’s to  Jo.  But
you’re JoinJ,  and that’s an order!” He  slammed the microShone back into
Kynes’ hands, muttered: “Sorry,” as Kynes shook an inMured IinJer.
   “How  much time?” Paul asked.

142
   “Nine  minutes,” Kynes said.
   The Duke said: “This shiS has more Sower than the others. II we took oII
under Met with three-Tuarter winJs, we could crowd in an additional man.”
   “That  sand’s soIt,” Kynes said.
   “With   Iour e[tra  men aboard on a Met takeoII, we could snaS the winJs,
Sire,” Halleck said.
   “Not  on this shiS,”  the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the
’thoSter Jlided  in  beside  the crawler.  The  winJs  tiSSed uS, braked the
’thoSter to a skiddinJ stoS within twenty meters oI the Iactory.
   The crawler was silent now, no sand sSoutinJ Irom its vents. Only a Iaint
mechanical rumble issued Irom   it,  becominJ more  audible as  the Duke
oSened his door.
   Immediately,  their  nostrils  were  assailed by  the odor  oI  cinnamon—
heavy and SunJent.
   With  a loud IlaSSinJ, the sSotter aircraIt Jlided down to  the sand on the
other side oI the crawler. The Duke’s own escort swooSed in to land in line
with him.
   Paul, lookinJ  out at the Iactory, saw how  all the ’thoSters were dwarIed
by it—Jnats beside a warrior beetle.
   “Gurney,  you   and Paul  toss  out  that rear  seat,”  the  Duke  said.  He
manually cranked the winJs out to  three-Tuarters, set their anJle, checked
the Met Sod controls.  “Why   the  devil   aren’t  they  cominJ   out  oI  that
machine?”
   “They’re  hoSinJ the carryall will  show uS,” Kynes said. “They still  have
a Iew minutes.” He Jlanced oII to the east.
   All   turned to look  the same direction, seeinJ no siJn  oI  the worm, but
there was a heavy, charJed IeelinJ oI an[iety in the air.
   The  Duke took  the  microShone, Sunched Ior his command  IreTuency,
said: “Two oI you toss out your shield Jenerators. By the numbers. You can
carry one more man that way. We’re not leavinJ any men Ior that monster.”
He keyed back to the workinJ IreTuency, barked:
   “All   riJht,  you in Delta AMa[ niner! Out! Now!  This is  a command Irom
your Duke! On the double or I’ll cut that crawler aSart with a lasJun!”
   A  hatch snaSSed oSen near the Iront oI the Iactory, another at the rear,
another at the toS. Men came tumblinJ out, slidinJ and scramblinJ down to
the sand. A tall man in a Satched workinJ robe was the last to emerJe. He
MumSed down to a track and then to the sand.

143
   The  Duke hunJ the microShone on the Sanel, swunJ out onto the winJ
steS, shouted: “Two men each into your sSotters.”
   The man in  the Satched robe beJan tollinJ oII Sairs oI his crew, SushinJ
them toward the craIt waitinJ on the other side.
   “Four  over here!” the Duke shouted. “Four into that shiS back there!” He
Mabbed a IinJer at an escort ’thoSter directly behind him. The Juards were
Must wrestlinJ the shield Jenerator out oI it. “And  Iour  into that  shiS over
there!” He  Sointed to  the other escort that  had shed its shield  Jenerator.
“Three each into the others! Run, you sand doJs!”
   The  tall  man Iinished countinJ  oII  his  crew, came sloJJinJ  across the
sand Iollowed by three oI his comSanions.
   “I  hear the worm, but I can’t see it,” Kynes said.
   The  others heard it   then—an abrasive slitherinJ,  distant  and JrowinJ
louder.
   “Damn  sloSSy way to oSerate,” the Duke muttered.
   AircraIt  beJan IlaSSinJ oII  the sand around them. It reminded the Duke
oI a time in his  home Slanet’s MunJles, a sudden emerJence into a clearinJ,
and carrion birds liItinJ away Irom the carcass oI a wild o[.
   The sSice workers sloJJed uS to the side oI the ’thoSter, started climbinJ
in behind the Duke. Halleck helSed, draJJinJ them into the rear.
   “In  you Jo, boys!” he snaSSed. “On the double!”
   Paul, crowded into a corner by sweatinJ men, smelled the SersSiration oI
Iear, saw that two oI the men had Soor neck adMustments on their stillsuits.
He Iiled the inIormation  in his memory Ior  Iuture action. His  Iather would
have to order tiJhter  stillsuit  disciSline.  Men tended to  become sloSSy iI
you didn’t watch such thinJs.
   The last man came JasSinJ into the rear, said, “The worm! It’s almost on
us! Blast oII!”
   The Duke  slid into  his seat, IrowninJ,  said: “We still  have almost three
minutes on the oriJinal contact estimate. Is that riJht, Kynes?” He shut his
door, checked it.
   “Almost  e[actly,  my Lord,”  Kynes said, and he thouJht: A cool one, this
duke.
   “All   secure here, Sire,” Halleck said.
   The Duke nodded, watched the last oI his escort take oII. He adMusted the
iJniter,  Jlanced  once more  at  winJs  and  instruments,  Sunched the Met
seTuence.

144
   The   take-oII   Sressed the  Duke   and  Kynes  deeS  into   their   seats,
comSressed the SeoSle in  the  rear. Kynes  watched the  way  the  Duke
handled the controls—Jently, surely. The ’thoSter was Iully  airborne now,
and the Duke studied his instruments, Jlanced leIt and riJht at his winJs.
   “She’s very heavy, Sire,” Halleck said.
   “Well   within  the  tolerances oI  this shiS,”  the Duke  said. “You   didn’t
really think I’d  risk this carJo, did you, Gurney?”
   Halleck Jrinned, said: “Not  a bit oI it, Sire.”
   The  Duke  banked his  craIt  in  a lonJ   easy curve—climbinJ  over  the
crawler.
   Paul, crushed into  a corner beside a window,  stared down at the  silent
machine on the  sand. The wormsiJn  had broken oII  about  Iour  hundred
meters Irom the crawler. And  now, there aSSeared to be turbulence in the
sand around the Iactory.
   “The  worm is  now beneath the crawler,” Kynes said. “You  are about to
witness a thinJ Iew have seen.”
   Flecks  oI  dust  shadowed the sand  around the  crawler  now. The  biJ
machine beJan to tiS down to  the riJht.  A  JiJantic  sand whirlSool beJan
IorminJ  there to the riJht  oI the  crawler. It moved  Iaster and Iaster. Sand
and dust Iilled the air now Ior hundreds oI meters around.
   Then they saw it!
   A  wide  hole  emerJed Irom the  sand. SunliJht  Ilashed Irom  JlisteninJ
white sSokes within it. The hole’s diameter was at least twice the lenJth oI
the crawler,  Paul  estimated. He  watched as  the machine  slid  into  that
oSeninJ in a billow oI dust and sand. The hole Sulled back.
   “Gods, what a monster!” muttered a man beside Paul.
   “Got  all our IloJJin’  sSice!” Jrowled another.
   “Someone is JoinJ to Say Ior this,” the Duke said. “I Sromise you that.”
   By  the very Ilatness oI his Iather’s voice, Paul sensed the deeS anJer. He
Iound that he shared it. This was criminal waste!
   In  the silence that Iollowed, they heard Kynes.
   “Bless  the Maker and His  water,” Kynes murmured. “Bless  the cominJ
and JoinJ oI  Him.  May His  SassaJe cleanse the world. May He keeS the
world Ior His SeoSle.”
   “What’s  that you’re sayinJ?” the Duke asked.
   But Kynes remained silent.

145
   Paul Jlanced at the men crowded around him. They were starinJ IearIully
at the back oI Kynes’ head. One oI them whisSered: “Liet.”
   Kynes turned, scowlinJ. The man sank back, abashed.
   Another oI  the rescued men beJan couJhinJ—dry and rasSinJ. Presently,
he JasSed: “Curse this hell hole!”
   The tall  Dune man who  had come last out oI the crawler said: “Be  you
still, Coss. You but worsen your couJh.” He stirred amonJ the men until he
could look throuJh them at the back oI the Duke’s head. “You be the Duke
Leto, I warrant,” he said. “It’s  to you we Jive thanks Ior our lives. We were
ready to end it there until you came alonJ.”
   “Quiet,  man, and let the Duke Ily his shiS,” Halleck muttered.
   Paul  Jlanced at Halleck.  He, too,  had seen the tension wrinkles  at the
corner oI his Iather’s Maw. One walked soItly when the Duke was in a raJe.
   Leto beJan easinJ his ’thoSter out oI its Jreat bankinJ circle, stoSSed at a
new siJn  oI  movement on  the sand. The  worm  had withdrawn  into  the
deSths and now, near where the crawler had been, two IiJures could be seen
movinJ north away Irom  the sand deSression. They aSSeared to Jlide over
the surIace with hardly a liItinJ oI dust to mark their SassaJe.
   “Who’s  that down there?” the Duke barked.
   “Two  Johnnies who  came alonJ Ior  the ride,  Scor,” said the  tall Dune
man.
   “Why  wasn’t somethinJ said about them?”
   “It  was the chance they took, Soor,” the Dune man said.
   “My   Lord,” said Kynes, “these men know it’s oI little  use to do anythinJ
about men traSSed on the desert in worm country.”
   “We’ll  send a shiS Irom base Ior them!” the Duke snaSSed.
   “As  you wish, my Lord,”  Kynes said. “But likely  when the shiS Jets here
there’ll be no one to rescue.”
   “We’ll  send a shiS, anyway,” the Duke said.
   “They  were riJht  beside where the worm came uS,” Paul  said. “How’d
they escaSe?”
   “The  sides oI the hole cave in and make the distances deceStive,” Kynes
said.
   “You  waste Iuel here, Sire,” Halleck ventured.
   “Aye,  Gurney.”
   The  Duke brouJht  his craIt  around toward the  Shield Wall.  His escort
came down Irom  circlinJ   stations, took  uS Sositions above and on  both

146
sides.
   Paul thouJht  about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed
halI-truths, outriJht lies. The men on the sand had Jlided across the surIace
so surely, movinJ  in a  way obviously  calculated to  keeS Irom lurinJ  the
worm back out oI its deSths.
   Fremen! Paul thouJht. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else
might be left out of your worries as a matter of course—because they are in
no danger?  They know how  to  live  here! They know  how to  outwit  the
worm!
   “What  were Fremen doinJ on that crawler?” Paul asked.
   Kynes whirled.
   The  tall Dune  man turned wide eyes on Paul—blue  within  blue within
blue. “Who be this lad?” he asked.
   Halleck  moved to Slace himselI between the man and Paul, said: “This is
Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.”
   “Why  says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?” the man asked.
   “They  Iit the descriStion,” Paul said.
   Kynes  snorted. “You  can’t  tell  Fremen  Must by lookinJ at  them!”  He
looked at the Dune man. “You. Who were those men?”
   “Friends  oI one oI  the others,” the Dune man said. “Just Iriends Irom  a
villaJe who wanted to see the sSice sands.”
   Kynes turned away. “Fremen!”
   But  he was  rememberinJ the words oI  the  leJend: “TheLisan  al-Gaib
shall see through all subterfuge. ”
   “They  be dead now, most likely,  younJ Soor,” the Dune man said. “We
should not sSeak unkindly on them.”
   But  Paul heard the  Ialsehood in their  voices, Ielt  the  menace that had
brouJht Halleck instinctively into JuardinJ Sosition.
   Paul sSoke dryly: “A terrible Slace Ior them to die.”
   Without  turninJ, Kynes said: “When God hath ordained a creature to die
in a Sarticular Slace, He causeth that creature’s wants to direct him to that
Slace.”
   Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes.
   And  Kynes, returninJ the stare, Iound himselI  troubled by a Iact he had
observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was
over the spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He
passed off the loss of a spice crawler  with  a gesture. The threat to  men’s

147
lives had  him in  a  rage. A  leader  such as that  would command fanatic
loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.
   AJainst  his  own  will   and all  Srevious  MudJments, Kynes admitted to
himselI: I like this Duke.

148
        Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-
        making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling
        for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong
        sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The
        sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this Tuality, even occasional
        greatness will destroy a man.
                                               —from “Collected SayinJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
  IN THE  dininJ   hall   oI  the Arrakeen    Jreat  house,  susSensor  lamSs  had  been
liJhted   aJainst  the  early  dark.   They  cast  their  yellow   Jlows   uSward   onto  the
black  bull’s    head  with   its  bloody    horns,   and  onto  the  darkly    JlisteninJ    oil
SaintinJ   oI the  Old  Duke.
    Beneath     these   talismans,     white     linen     shone   around     the    burnished
reIlections     oI    the   Atreides     silver,    which     had   been    Slaced   in    Srecise
arranJements    alonJ   the  Jreat   table—little     archiSelaJos    oI   service   waitinJ
beside   crystal   Jlasses,   each   settinJ    sTuared   oII   beIore    a  heavy   wooden
chair.   The   classic    central    chandelier    remained     unliJhted,     and   its   chain
twisted   uSward   into   shadows  where   the  mechanism    oI  the  Soison-snooSer
had been  concealed.
    PausinJ   in   the  doorway    to  insSect   the  arranJements,    the   Duke   thouJht
about  the Soison-snooSer   and  what  it  siJniIied    in  his  society.
    All   of   a  pattern,     he  thought.    You  can   plumb    us  by   our   language-the
precise  and  delicate   delineations    for   ways  to  administer    treacherous   death.
Will   someone   try   chaumurky    tonight—poison      in  the   drink?    Or   will   it   be
chaumas—poison    in  the food?
    He  shook  his  head.
    Beside   each  Slate  on  the  lonJ   table   stood   a IlaJon    oI  water.   There   was
enouJh  water   alonJ   the table,   the  Duke  estimated,   to  keeS  a Soor  Arrakeen
Iamily   Ior  more  than  a year.
    FlankinJ     the  doorway    in   which    he  stood   were   broad   lavinJ    basins   oI
ornate  yellow    and  Jreen  tile.   Each   basin  had  its  rack   oI  towels.   It   was  the
custom,   the  housekeeSer   had  e[Slained,     Ior   Juests  as  they   entered  to   diS
their  hands  ceremoniously     into  a  basin,  sloS  several   cuSs oI  water   onto  the
Iloor,  dry  their   hands  on a  towel  and  IlinJ   the  towel   into  the  JrowinJ    Suddle

149
at the  door. AIter  the  dinner, beJJars Jathered outside  to  Jet the  water
sTueezinJs Irom the towels.
   How typical  of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thouJht. Every degradation of
the spirit that can be conceived. He took a deeS breath, IeelinJ raJe tiJhten
his stomach.
   “The  custom stoSs here!” he muttered.
   He   saw  a  servinJ   woman—one  oI  the   old  and  Jnarled   ones the
housekeeSer had recommended—hoverinJ at the doorway Irom the kitchen
across Irom him. The Duke siJnaled with uSraised hand. She moved out oI
the shadows, scurried  around  the  table toward  him,   and he  noted  the
leathery Iace, the blue-within-blue eyes.
   “My  Lord  wishes?” She keSt her head bowed, eyes shielded.
   He Jestured. “Have these basins and towels removed.”
   “But…  Noble Born….”  She looked uS, mouth JaSinJ.
   “I   know the  custom!”  he barked. “Take these basins to the Iront  door.
While we’re  eatinJ and  until  we’ve Iinished,  each beJJar who calls  may
have a Iull cuS oI water. Understood?”
   Her leathery Iace disSlayed a twistinJ oI emotions: dismay, anJer….
   With  sudden insiJht, Leto realized that she must have Slanned to sell the
water sTueezinJs Irom the Ioot-tramSled  towels, wrinJinJ  a  Iew coSSers
Irom the wretches who came to the door. PerhaSs that also was a custom.
   His  Iace clouded, and he Jrowled:  “I’m  SostinJ a Juard to  see that my
orders are carried out to the letter.”
   He  whirled, strode back down the  SassaJe to the Great Hall. Memories
rolled  in   his  mind   like   the  toothless  mutterinJs  oI   old   women.  He
remembered oSen water and waves—days oI Jrass instead oI sand—dazed
summers that had whiSSed Sast him like windstorm leaves.
   All  Jone.
   I’m  getting old, he thought. I’ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in
what? An old woman’s greed.
   In  the  Great Hall,  the  Lady  Jessica was the center oI  a mi[ed   JrouS
standinJ in  Iront  oI  the IireSlace. An  oSen blaze crackled  there, castinJ
Ilickers  oI   oranJe liJht   onto  Mewels and laces  and costly   Iabrics.  He
recoJnized in  the JrouS  a stillsuit  manuIacturer down  Irom  CarthaJ,  an
electronics eTuiSment imSorter, a watershiSSer whose summer mansion was
near his Solar-caS Iactory, a  reSresentative oI the Guild  Bank  (lean and
remote, that one), a dealer in reSlacement Sarts Ior sSice mininJ eTuiSment,

150
a thin  and hard-Iaced woman whose escort service Ior  oII-Slanet visitors
reSutedly oSerated as cover Ior various smuJJlinJ, sSyinJ, and blackmail
oSerations.
   Most  oI   the women  in  the  hall  seemed cast Irom   a sSeciIic  tySe—
decorative,  Srecisely   turned  out,    an  odd   minJlinJ     oI   untouchable
sensuousness.
   Even without  her Sosition as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the
JrouS, he thouJht. She wore  no Mewelry and had chosen warm colors—a
lonJ dress almost the  shade oI the oSen blaze, and an earth-brown  band
around her bronzed hair.
   He  realized she had done this to taunt him  subtly, a reSrooI aJainst his
recent Sose oI coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these
shades—that he saw her as a rustlinJ oI warm colors.
   Nearby, more an outIlanker  than a member oI the JrouS, stood Duncan
Idaho in JlitterinJ dress uniIorm, Ilat Iace unreadable, the curlinJ black hair
neatly combed. He had been summoned back Irom the Fremen and had his
orders Irom Hawat—“Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady
Jessica under constant surveillance. ”
   The Duke Jlanced around the room.
   There  was Paul  in  the corner  surrounded by  a IawninJ  JrouS  oI  the
younJer Arrakeen  richece, and, alooI  amonJ them,  three oIIicers  oI  the
House TrooS. The Duke took Sarticular note oI the younJ women. What a
catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treatinJ all eTually with an air
oI reserved nobility.
   He’ll   wear the title  well, the  Duke thouJht, and realized with  a sudden
chill that this was another death thouJht.
   Paul saw his Iather in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at
the clusterinJs  oI  Juests,  the  Meweled hands clutchinJ drinks  (and  the
unobtrusive insSections with   tiny  remote-cast snooSers). SeeinJ all  the
chatterinJ Iaces, Paul was  suddenly reSelled by  them. They  were cheaS
masks locked on IesterinJ thouJhts—voices JabblinJ to drown out the loud
silence in every breast.
   I’m  in a sour mood, he thouJht, and wondered what Gurney would say to
that.
   He knew his mood’s source. He hadn’t wanted to attend this Iunction, but
his Iather had been Iirm. “You  have a Slace—a Sosition to uShold. You’re
old enouJh to do this. You’re almost a man.”

151
   Paul  saw his  Iather emerJe Irom  the doorway, insSect the  room, then
cross to the JrouS around the Lady Jessica.
   As  Leto aSSroached Jessica’s JrouS, the water-shiSSer was askinJ: “Is it
true the Duke will Sut in weather control?”
   From  behind the man, the Duke said:  “We haven’t Jone that  Iar in  our
thinkinJ, sir.”
   The man turned, e[SosinJ a bland round Iace, darkly tanned. “Ah-h,  the
Duke,” he said. “We missed you.”
   Leto   Jlanced  at  Jessica. “A   thinJ   needed doinJ.”   He  returned  his
attention to the water-shiSSer, e[Slained what he had ordered Ior the lavinJ
basins, addinJ: “As Iar as I’m concerned, the old custom ends now.”
   “Is  this a ducal order, m’Lord?” the man asked.
   “I  leave that to your own… ah … conscience,” the Duke said. He turned,
notinJ Kynes come uS to the JrouS.
   One  oI the  women said: “I   think  it’s  a very  Jenerous Jesture—JivinJ
water to the—” Someone shushed her.
   The  Duke looked  at Kynes,  notinJ that  the SlanetoloJist wore  an old-
style dark brown uniIorm with  eSaulets oI the ImSerial Civil Servant and a
tiny Jold teardroS oI rank at his collar.
   The  water-shiSSer asked in   an anJry   voice:  “Does  the  Duke  imSly
criticism oI our custom?”
   “This  custom has been chanJed,” Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked
the Irown on Jessica’s Iace, thouJht: A frown does not become her, but it’ll
increase rumors of friction between us.
   “With  the Duke’s Sermission,” the water-shiSSer said, “I’d like to inTuire
Iurther about customs.”
   Leto  heard the sudden oily tone in  the man’s voice, noted the watchIul
silence in this  JrouS, the way heads were beJinninJ  to turn  toward them
around the room.
   “Isn’t  it  almost time Ior dinner?” Jessica asked.
   “But   our Juest  has some Tuestions,” Leto  said. And  he looked  at the
water-shiSSer, seeinJ a round-Iaced man with  larJe  eyes and thick  liSs,
recallinJ  Hawat’s memorandum: “…   and this  watershipper is  a  man to
watch—Lingar Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him  but
never fully controlled him. ”
   “Water  customs are so interestinJ,” Bewt said, and there was a smile on
his Iace. “I’m  curious  what you intend about the conservatory attached to

152
this house. Do you  intend to continue IlauntinJ  it  in  the SeoSle’s Iaces…
m’Lord?”
   Leto  held anJer in check, starinJ at the man. ThouJhts raced throuJh his
mind.  It  had  taken bravery  to  challenJe  him  in  his  own  ducal  castle,
esSecially since   they  now   had  Bewt’s   siJnature  over  a   contract  oI
alleJiance. The  action had  taken, also, a  knowledJe  oI  Sersonal Sower.
Water was, indeed, Sower here. II water Iacilities were mined, Ior instance,
ready to be  destroyed at a  siJnal…. The  man looked  caSable oI such a
thinJ. Destruction oI water Iacilities miJht  well destroy Arrakis. That could
well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.
   “My   Lord,   the Duke,  and  I  have  other Slans Ior   our  conservatory,”
Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. “We intend to keeS it, certainly, but only to
hold it  in trust Ior  the SeoSle oI Arrakis. It  is our dream that someday the
climate  oI  Arrakis   may  be  chanJed  suIIiciently   to  Jrow   such  Slants
anywhere in the oSen.”
   Bless her! Leto thouJht. Let our water-shipper chew on that.
   “Your  interest in  water and weather control is obvious,”  the Duke  said.
“I’d  advise you  to diversiIy  your  holdinJs.  One day, water will   not be a
Srecious commodity on Arrakis.”
   And   he thouJht:  Hawat  must  redouble his  efforts  at  infiltrating   this
Bewt’s organization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at once.
No man is going to hold a club over my head!
   Bewt  nodded, the smile  still  on his  Iace. “A  commendable dream, my
Lord.” He withdrew a Sace.
   Leto’s  attention was cauJht by the e[Sression on Kynes’ Iace. The man
was starinJ at Jessica. He aSSeared transIiJured—like a man in love … or
cauJht in a reliJious trance.
   Kynes’  thouJhts  were overwhelmed at  last by  the words oI  SroShecy:
“And  they shall  share your most precious dream.  ”  He sSoke directly  to
Jessica: “Do you brinJ the shorteninJ oI the way?”
   “Ah,  Dr. Kynes,”  the water-shiSSer said. “You’ve come in Irom tramSinJ
around with your mobs oI Fremen. How Jracious oI you.”
   Kynes  Sassed an unreadable Jlance across Bewt, said: “It is said in the
desert that Sossession oI water in Jreat amount can inIlict a man with Iatal
carelessness.”
   “They  have many stranJe sayinJs in the desert,” Bewt said, but his voice
betrayed uneasiness.

153
   Jessica crossed to Leto, sliSSed her hand under his arm to Jain a moment
in which to calm herselI. Kynes had said: “…the shorteninJ oI the way.” In
the  old   tonJue,   the  Shrase  translated  as  “Kwisatz    Haderach.”  The
SlanetoloJist’s odd Tuestion seemed to have Jone unnoticed by the others,
and now Kynes was bendinJ over one oI the consort women, listeninJ to a
low-voiced coTuetry.
   Kwisatz Haderach, Jessica thouJht. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant
that legend here, too?  The  thouJht Ianned her  secret hoSe Ior  Paul. He
could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.
   The  Guild  Bank  reSresentative had Iallen  into  conversation  with  the
water-shiSSer, and  Bewt’s   voice   liIted   above   the  renewed  hum   oI
conversations: “Many SeoSle have souJht to chanJe Arrakis.”
   The  Duke  saw  how  the  words seemed to  Sierce Kynes,  MerkinJ the
SlanetoloJist uSriJht and away Irom the IlirtinJ woman.
   Into  the sudden silence, a house trooSer in uniIorm oI a Iootman cleared
his throat behind Leto, said: “Dinner is served, my Lord.”
   The Duke directed a TuestioninJ Jlance down at Jessica.
   “The  custom here is Ior host and hostess to Iollow their Juests to table,”
she said, and smiled: “Shall we chanJe that one, too, my Lord?”
   He sSoke coldly: “That  seems a Joodly custom. We shall let it stand Ior
now.”
   The  illusion   that  I  suspect her  of  treachery must  be maintained,  he
thouJht. He Jlanced at the Juests IilinJ Sast them. Who among you believes
this lie?
   Jessica,  sensinJ  his  remoteness, wondered  at   it   as  she  had  done
IreTuently the Sast week. He acts like a  man struggling  with himself, she
thouJht. Is it because I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he
knows how important it  is that we begin to  mix our officers  and men with
the locals on a  social plane. We are father and  mother surrogate to them
all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.
   Leto,  watchinJ the Juests Iile Sast, recalled what ThuIir Hawat had said
when inIormed oI the aIIair: “Sire! I  forbid it!”
   A  Jrim  smile  touched the Duke’s mouth.  What a  scene that had been.
And  when the  Duke had  remained adamant about attendinJ  the dinner,
Hawat had shaken his head. “I have bad IeelinJs about this, my Lord,” he’d
said. “ThinJs move too swiItly  on Arrakis.  That’s not like the Harkonnens.
Not like them at all.”

154
   Paul Sassed his Iather escortinJ a younJ woman halI  a head taller than
himselI. He shot a sour Jlance at his Iather, nodded at somethinJ the younJ
woman said.
   “Her  Iather  manuIactures stillsuits,”  Jessica said. “I’m  told that  only  a
Iool would be cauJht in the deeS desert wearinJ one oI the man’s suits.”
   “Who’s  the man with the scarred Iace ahead oI Paul?” the Duke asked. “I
don’t Slace him.”
   “A    late  addition  to  the  list,”   she  whisSered. “Gurney  arranJed  the
invitation. SmuJJler.”
   “Gurney  arranJed?”
   “At   my reTuest. It  was cleared with Hawat,  althouJht I  thouJht Hawat
was a little stiII  about it.  The smuJJler’s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He’s a
Sower amonJ his kind. They all know him  here. He’s dined at many oI the
houses.”
   “Why  is he here?”
   “Everyone  here will  ask that Tuestion,” she said. “Tuek  will  sow doubt
and susSicion Must by his  Sresence. He’ll  also serve  notice  that you’re
SreSared to back uS your orders aJainst JraIt—by  enIorcement Irom  the
smuJJlers’ end as well. This was the Soint Hawat aSSeared to like.”
   “I’m   not sure I like it.” He nodded to a SassinJ couSle, saw only a Iew oI
their  Juests remained  to  Srecede them.  “Why   didn’t  you   invite  some
Fremen?”
   “There’s Kynes,”  she said.
   “Yes,  there’s  Kynes,”   he  said. “Have   you  arranJed  any other  little
surSrises Ior me?” He led her into steS behind the Srocession.
   “All   else is most conventional,” she said.
   And  she thouJht: My  darling,  can’t you see that this smuggler controls
fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape
from A rrakis if all else fails us here.
   As  they emerJed into the  dininJ hall,  she disenJaJed her arm, allowed
Leto to seat her. He strode to his end oI the table. A Iootman held his chair
Ior him. The others settled with a swishinJ  oI Iabrics, a scraSinJ oI chairs,
but the  Duke remained standinJ.  He Jave  a hand siJnal,  and the  house
trooSers in Iootman  uniIorm  around the  table steSSed back, standinJ at
attention.
   Uneasy silence settled over the room.

155
   Jessica, lookinJ down the lenJth oI the table, saw a Iaint tremblinJ at the
corners oI Leto’s mouth, noted the dark Ilush oI anJer on his cheeks. What
has angered  him?  she  asked herselI.  Surely  not  my  invitation   to  the
smuggler.
   “Some  Tuestion my  chanJinJ  oI the  lavinJ  basin custom,”  Leto  said.
“This is my way oI tellinJ  you that many thinJs will chanJe.”
   Embarrassed silence settled over the table.
   They think him drunk, Jessica thouJht.
   Leto  liIted his water IlaJon,  held it aloIt  where the susSensor liJhts shot
beams oI reIlection oII it.  “As a Chevalier oI  the ImSerium, then,” he said,
“I Jive you a toast.”
   The  others JrasSed their IlaJons, all  eyes Iocused on the Duke.  In the
sudden stillness, a susSensor liJht driIted sliJhtly in an errant breeze Irom
the servinJ  kitchen   hallway.  Shadows Slayed across  the Duke’s   hawk
Ieatures.
   “Here  I am and here I remain!” he barked.
   There was an abortive movement oI IlaJons toward mouths—stoSSed as
the Duke remained with arm uSraised. “My toast is one oI those ma[ims so
dear to our hearts: ‘Business makes SroJress! Fortune Sasses everywhere!’
”
   He siSSed his water.
   The others Moined him. QuestioninJ Jlances Sassed amonJ them.
   “Gurney!”  the Duke called.
   From  an alcove at Leto’s end oI the room came Halleck’s voice.  “Here,
my Lord.”
   “Give  us a tune, Gurney.”
   A  minor chord Irom  the baliset Iloated out oI the alcove. Servants beJan
SuttinJ Slates oI Iood on the table  at the Duke’s Jesture releasinJ them—
roast desert hare in  sauce ceSeda, aSlomaJe sirian, chukka under Jlass,
coIIee with melanJe (a rich cinnamon odor Irom the sSice waIted across the
table), a true Sot-a-oie served with sSarklinJ Caladan wine.
   Still,  the Duke remained standinJ.
   As  the  Juests waited,  their  attention  torn  between the  dishes Slaced
beIore them and the standinJ Duke, Leto said: “In  olden times, it  was the
duty oI the host to entertain his Juests with his own  talents.” His knuckles
turned white, so Iiercely did  he JriS his water IlaJon. “I   cannot sinJ, but I

156
Jive you the words oI  Gurney’s sonJ. Consider it another toast—a toast to
all who’ve died brinJinJ us to this station.”
   An  uncomIortable stirrinJ sounded around the table.
   Jessica lowered her Jaze, Jlanced at the SeoSle seated nearest her—there
was the round-Iaced water-shiSSer and his  woman, the Sale and  austere
Guild Bank  reSresentative (he seemed a whistleIaced scarecrow with his
eyes Ii[ed  on Leto), the  ruJJed and scar-Iaced Tuek, his blue-within-blue
eyes downcast.
   “Review,  Iriends—trooSs lonJ  Sast review,” the  Duke intoned. “All   to
Iate a weiJht   oI Sains and  dollars. Their  sSirits  wear our  silver  collars.
Review, Iriends—trooSs  lonJ  Sast review:  Each  a dot  oI  time  without
Sretense or Juile. With them Sasses the lure oI Iortune. Review, Iriends—
trooSs lonJ Sast review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we’ll Sass
the lure oI Iortune.”
   The Duke allowed his voice to trail  oII on the last line, took a deeS drink
Irom his water IlaJon,  slammed it back onto the table. Water sloSSed over
the brim onto the linen.
   The others drank in embarrassed silence.
   AJain,   the  Duke  liIted   his  water  IlaJon,  and  this  time  emStied  its
remaininJ halI onto the Iloor, knowinJ that the others around the table must
do the same.
   Jessica was Iirst to Iollow his e[amSle.
   There  was  a Irozen  moment  beIore the  others beJan  emStyinJ  their
IlaJons. Jessica saw how  Paul, seated near his  Iather, was  studyinJ the
reactions around him. She Iound herselI also Iascinated by what her Juests’
actions revealed—esSecially amonJ the women. This  was clean,  Sotable
water, not somethinJ already cast away in a soSSinJ towel. Reluctance to
Must discard it e[Sosed itselI in tremblinJ hands, delayed reactions, nervous
lauJhter… and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman droSSed her
IlaJon, looked the other way as her male comSanion recovered it.
   Kynes,  thouJh,  cauJht  her  attention  most  sharSly. The  SlanetoloJist
hesitated, then emStied his IlaJon into  a container beneath his Macket. He
smiled at Jessica as he cauJht her watchinJ him, raised the emSty IlaJon to
her in a silent toast. He aSSeared comSletely unembarrassed by his action.
   Halleck’s  music still   waIted over the  room, but  it  had come out oI  its
minor key, liltinJ and lively  now as thouJh he were tryinJ to liIt the mood.
   “Let  the dinner commence,” the Duke said, and sank into his chair.

157
   He’s  angry  and  uncertain,  Jessica thouJht.  The  loss  of  that  factory
crawler hit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more
than that loss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her Iork, hoSinJ in
the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.
   Slowly  at Iirst, then with increasinJ animation, the dinner Jot under way.
The stillsuit manuIacturer comSlimented Jessica on her cheI and wine.
   “We brouJht both Irom Caladan,” she said.
   “SuSerb!”  he said, tastinJ the chukka. “SimSly suSerb! And not a hint oI
melanJe in it. One Jets so tired oI the sSice in everythinJ.”
   The  Guild  Bank reSresentative looked across at Kynes. “I   understand,
Doctor Kynes, that another Iactory crawler has been lost to a worm.”
   “News  travels Iast,” the Duke said.
   “Then  it’s true?” the banker asked, shiItinJ his attention to Leto.
   “OI    course,  it’s   true!”   the   Duke   snaSSed. “The  blasted  carry-all
disaSSeared. It shouldn’t be Sossible Ior anythinJ that biJ to disaSSear!”
   “When  the worm came, there was nothinJ to recover the crawler,” Kynes
said.
   “It  should not be Sossible!” the Duke reSeated.
   “No  one saw the carryall leave?” the banker asked.
   “SSotters customarily keeS their eyes on the sand,” Kynes said. “They’re
Srimarily interested in wormsiJn.  A  carryall’s comSlement usually is Iour
men—two Silots and two Mourneymen attachers. II one—or even two oI this
crew were in the Say oI the Duke’s Ioes—”
   “Ah-h-h,  I  see,” the banker said. “And  you, as JudJe oI the ChanJe, do
you challenJe this?”
   “I   shall  have to  consider  my  Sosition careIully,”   Kynes said,  “and  I
certainly will  not discuss it at table.” And he thouJht: That pale skeleton of
a man! He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.
   The banker smiled, returned his attention to his Iood.
   Jessica sat rememberinJ a lecture Irom  her Bene Gesserit school days.
The subMect had been esSionaJe and counter-esSionaJe. A SlumS, haSSy-
Iaced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her  Molly voice contrastinJ
weirdly with the subMect matter.
   A  thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is
the  similar  basic   reaction  pattern  of  all   its   graduates. Any   enclosed
discipline  sets its  stamp, its  pattern,  upon  its  students. That pattern  is
susceptible to analysis and prediction.

158
   Now, motivational  patterns are going to be similar  among all espionage
agents. That is to  say: there  will  be certain  types of  motivation that  are
similar despite differing  schools or opposed aims. You will study first how
to  separate this  element  for  your   analysis—in  the beginning,  through
interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators;
secondly, by close  observation of  language-thought orientation  of  those
under analysis. You will find it fairly simple to determine the root languages
of  your  subjects, of   course, both  through  voice  inflection   and  speech
pattern.
   Now,  sittinJ at table with her son and her Duke and their Juests, hearinJ
that Guild  Bank reSresentative, Jessica Ielt a chill oI  realization: the man
was a Harkonnen aJent. He  had the Giedi  Prime  sSeech Sattern—subtly
masked, but e[Sosed to her trained awareness as thouJh he had announced
himselI.
   Does this mean the Guild  itself has taken sides against House Atreides?
she asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by
calling  for  a new  dish, all  the while  listening  for  the man  to betray  his
purpose. He   will   shift  the   conversation next   to  something  seemingly
innocent, but with ominous overtones, she told herself. It’s his pattern.
   The  banker swallowed, took a siS oI  wine, smiled at  somethinJ said to
him by the woman on his riJht. He seemed to listen Ior a moment to a man
down the table who was e[SlaininJ to the Duke that native Arrakeen Slants
had no thorns.
   “I   enMoy watchinJ the  IliJhts  oI   birds  on  Arrakis,”  the  banker  said,
directinJ  his words  at Jessica. “All   oI  our birds,  oI  course, are carrion-
eaters, and many e[ist without water, havinJ become blood-drinkers.”
   The stillsuit  manuIacterer’s dauJhter, seated between Paul and his Iather
at the other end oI the table, twisted her Sretty Iace into a Irown, said: “Oh,
Soo-Soo, you say the most disJustinJ thinJs.”
   The banker smiled. “They call me Soo-Soo because I’m Iinancial adviser
to the  Water Peddlers Union.”  And,  as Jessica continued to look  at him
without comment, he added: “Because oI the water-sellers’ cry—‘Soo-Soo
Sook!’ ”  And he imitated the call with  such accuracy that many around the
table lauJhed.
   Jessica heard the boastIul tone oI voice,  but noted most that the  younJ
woman had sSoken on cue—a set Siece. She had Sroduced the e[cuse Ior
the banker to say what he had said. She Jlanced at LinJar Bewt. The water

159
maJnate was scowlinJ, concentratinJ on his dinner. It came to Jessica that
the banker  had said:  “I,   too,  control  that  ultimate  source of  power  on
Arrakis—water. ”
   Paul had marked the Ialseness in his dinner comSanion’s voice, saw that
his mother was IollowinJ the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On
imSulse, he decided to Slay the Ioil, draw the e[chanJe  out. He addressed
himselI to the banker.
   “Do  you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?”
   “That’s  an odd Tuestion, younJ Master,” the banker said. “I  merely said
the birds drink blood. It doesn’t have to be the blood oI their own kind, does
it?”
   “It   was not  an odd  Tuestion,” Paul  said, and Jessica noted the brittle
riSoste Tuality oI her traininJ e[Sosed in his voice.  “Most educated SeoSle
know  that the  worst  Sotential comSetition Ior   any younJ  orJanism  can
come Irom its  own kind.”   He deliberately Iorked  a bite  oI Iood  Irom  his
comSanion’s Slate, ate it. “They are eatinJ Irom the same bowl. They have
the same basic reTuirements.”
   The banker stiIIened, scowled at the Duke.
   “Do  not  make the error oI  considerinJ my son a child,”   the Duke said.
And he smiled.
   Jessica Jlanced around the table,  noted that Bewt  had briJhtened, that
both Kynes and the smuJJler, Tuek, were JrinninJ.
   “It’s   a rule oI  ecoloJy,” Kynes  said, “that the  younJ Master aSSears to
understand Tuite well. The struJJle between liIe elements is the struJJle Ior
the Iree enerJy oI a system. Blood’s an eIIicient enerJy source.”
   The banker Sut down his Iork, sSoke in an anJry voice: “It’s said that the
Fremen scum drink the blood oI their dead.”
   Kynes shook his head, sSoke in a lecturinJ tone: “Not the blood, sir. But
all oI  a man’s water, ultimately, belonJs to  his SeoSle—to his tribe. It’s  a
necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water’s Srecious there, and
the human body is comSosed oI some seventy Ser cent water by weiJht. A
dead man, surely, no lonJer reTuires that water.”
   The banker Sut both hands aJainst the table beside his Slate, and Jessica
thouJht he was JoinJ to Sush himselI back, leave in a raJe.
   Kynes looked  at Jessica. “ForJive me, my Lady, Ior elaboratinJ on such
an uJly subMect at table, but you were beinJ told Ialsehood and it  needed
clariIyinJ.”

160
   “You’ve    associated  so   lonJ    with    Fremen   that   you’ve   lost    all
sensibilities,” the banker rasSed.
   Kynes  looked at him calmly,  studied the Sale, tremblinJ Iace. “Are  you
challenJinJ me, sir?”
   The banker Iroze. He swallowed, sSoke stiIIly: “OI  course not. I’d not so
insult our host and hostess.”
   Jessica heard the  Iear  in  the man’s  voice,  saw it   in  his  Iace, in  his
breathinJ, in  the Sulse oI a  vein at his  temSle. The man was terriIied  oI
Kynes!
   “Our  host and hostess are Tuite caSable oI decidinJ Ior themselves when
they’ve been insulted,” Kynes said. “They’re brave SeoSle who understand
deIense oI honor. We all may attest to their couraJe by the Iact that they are
here… now… on Arrakis.”
   Jessica saw that Leto  was enMoyinJ this. Most oI  the others were  not.
PeoSle all around the table sat Soised Ior IliJht, hands out oI siJht under the
table. Two notable e[ceStions were Bewt,  who was oSenly smilinJ  at the
banker’s  discomIiture,  and  the  smuJJler,   Tuek,  who   aSSeared to be
watchinJ Kynes Ior  a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was lookinJ at  Kynes in
admiration.
   “Well?”  Kynes said.
   “I  meant no oIIense,” the banker muttered. “II  oIIense was taken, Slease
acceSt my aSoloJies.”
   “Freely   Jiven,   Ireely  acceSted,” Kynes   said.  He  smiled  at  Jessica,
resumed eatinJ as thouJh nothinJ had haSSened.
   Jessica saw that the smuJJler, too, had rela[ed. She marked this: the man
had shown every asSect oI an aide ready to leaS to Kynes’ assistance. There
e[isted an accord oI some sort between Kynes and Tuek.
   Leto  toyed with  a Iork,  looked  sSeculatively at Kynes. The  ecoloJist’s
manner indicated a chanJe in attitude toward the House oI Atreides. Kynes
had seemed colder on their triS over the desert.
   Jessica siJnaled Ior another course oI Iood and drink. Servants aSSeared
with langues de lapins  de garenne—red wine and a  sauce oI mushroom-
yeast on the side.
   Slowly,  the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the aJitation
in it,  the  brittle  Tuality, saw that  the banker ate in  sullen  silence. Kynes
would have killed him without hesitating, she thouJht. And she realized that

161
there was an oIIhand attitude toward killinJ   in  Kynes’  manner. He was a
casual killer, and she Juessed that this was a Fremen Tuality.
   Jessica turned to the stillsuit manuIacturer on her leIt, said: “I Iind myselI
continually amazed by the imSortance oI water on Arrakis.”
   “Very  imSortant,” he aJreed. “What is this dish? It’s delicious.”
   “TonJues oI wild  rabbit in a sSecial sauce,” she said. “A very old reciSe.”
   “I  must have that reciSe,” the man said.
   She nodded. “I’ll  see that you Jet it.”
   Kynes  looked  at  Jessica, said: “The  newcomer  to  Arrakis  IreTuently
underestimates the imSortance oI water here. You are dealinJ, you see, with
the Law oI the Minimum.”
   She heard the testinJ Tuality in his voice, said, “Growth is limited by that
necessity which is  Sresent in  the least amount. And,  naturally,  the least
Iavorable condition controls the Jrowth rate.”
   “It’s   rare to  Iind   members oI  a Great  House aware oI  SlanetoloJical
Sroblems,” Kynes said. “Water is  the least Iavorable condition  Ior liIe  on
Arrakis.   And   remember  that  Jrowth   itselI   can   Sroduce unIavorable
conditions unless treated with e[treme care.”
   Jessica sensed a hidden messaJe in Kynes’  words,  but knew  she was
missinJ it. “Growth,”   she said. “Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly
cycle oI water to sustain human liIe under more Iavorable conditions?”
   “ImSossible!”  the water maJnate barked.
   Jessica turned her attention to Bewt. “ImSossible?”
   “ImSossible  on Arrakis,”  he said. “Don’t   listen to this  dreamer. All  the
laboratory evidence is aJainst him.”
   Kynes  looked  at Bewt,  and Jessica noted that the  other conversations
around the  table  had  stoSSed while  SeoSle concentrated on   this  new
interchanJe.
   “Laboratory  evidence tends to  blind  us to  a  very simSle Iact,”   Kynes
said. “That Iact is this: we are dealinJ here with matters that oriJinated and
e[ist   out-oI-doors   where  Slants  and  animals   carry  on   their   normal
e[istence.”
   “Normal!”   Bewt snorted. “NothinJ about Arrakis is normal!”
   “Quite   the contrary,”  Kynes said.  “Certain harmonies could  be set  uS
here alonJ selI-sustaininJ lines. You merely have to understand the limits oI
the Slanet and the Sressures uSon it.”
   “It’ll   never be done,” Bewt said.

162
   The Duke  came to a sudden realization, SlacinJ the Soint where Kynes’
attitude had chanJed—it had been when Jessica had sSoken oI holdinJ the
conservatory Slants in trust Ior Arrakis.
   “What  would it  take to set uS the selI-sustaininJ system, Doctor Kynes?”
Leto asked.
   “II   we  can Jet  three  Ser cent oI  the  Jreen Slant  element on  Arrakis
involved  in  IorminJ  carbon comSounds as IoodstuIIs,  we’ve  started the
cyclic system,” Kynes said.
   “Water’s   the  only   Sroblem?”   the  Duke   asked. He   sensed Kynes’
e[citement, Ielt himselI cauJht uS in it.
   “Water  overshadows the other Sroblems,” Kynes said. “This  Slanet has
much o[yJen  without   its usual  concomitants—widesSread Slant liIe and
larJe sources oI Iree carbon dio[ide   Irom  such Shenomena as volcanoes.
There are unusual chemical interchanJes over larJe surIace areas here.”
   “Do  you have Silot SroMects?” the Duke asked.
   “We’ve  had a lonJ time in  which to build  uS the Tansley EIIect—small-
unit e[Seriments  on an  amateur basis Irom  which my  science may  now
draw its workinJ Iacts,” Kynes said.
   “There isn’t  enouJh water,” Bewt said. “There Must isn’t enouJh water.”
   “Master  Bewt is an e[Sert on water,” Kynes said. He smiled, turned back
to his dinner.
   The  Duke  Jestured sharSly down with  his  riJht  hand, barked:  “No!  I
want an answer! Is there enouJh water, Doctor Kynes?”
   Kynes stared at his Slate.
   Jessica watched the Slay oI emotion on his Iace. He masks himselI well,
she thouJht, but she had him reJistered now and read that he reJretted his
words.
   “Is  there enouJh water!” the Duke demanded.
   “There…  may be,” Kynes said.
   He’s faking uncertainty! Jessica thouJht.
   With  his deeSer truthsense, Paul cauJht the underlyinJ motive, had to use
every ounce oI his traininJ to mask his e[citement. There is enough water!
But Kynes doesn’t wish it to be known.
   “Our  SlanetoloJist has many interestinJ dreams,” Bewt said. “He dreams
with the Fremen—oI SroShecies and messiahs.”
   Chuckles sounded at odd Slaces around the table. Jessica marked them—
the smuJJler,  the  stillsuit   manuIacturer’s  dauJhter, Duncan  Idaho,  the

163
woman with the mysterious escort service.
   Tensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thouJht. There’s too
much  going  on  of   which   I’m   not  aware.  I’ll    have  to   develop  new
information sources.
   The Duke  Sassed his Jaze Irom Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He Ielt oddly
let down,  as thouJh  somethinJ vital  had  Sassed him here. “Maybe,”   he
muttered.
   Kynes sSoke Tuickly: “PerhaSs we should discuss this another time, my
Lord. There are so many—”
   The  SlanetoloJist broke oII  as a uniIormed  Atreides trooSer hurried  in
throuJh the service door, was Sassed by the Juard and rushed to the Duke’s
side. The man bent, whisSerinJ into Leto’s ear.
   Jessica  recoJnized   the   caSsiJn  oI    Hawat’s   corSs,  IouJht    down
uneasiness. She addressed herselI to the stillsuit manuIacturer’s Ieminine
comSanion—a tiny,  dark-haired  woman   with  a  doll   Iace,  a  touch  oI
eSicanthic Iold to the eyes.
   “You’ve  hardly touched your dinner, my dear,” Jessica said. “May I order
you somethinJ?”
   The woman  looked at the stillsuit  manuIacturer beIore answerinJ, then:
“I’m  not very hunJry.”
   AbruStly,  the Duke stood uS beside his trooSer, sSoke in a harsh tone oI
command: “Stay  seated, everyone. You  will   have to  IorJive  me,  but  a
matter has arisen that reTuires my  Sersonal attention.” He steSSed aside.
“Paul, take over as host Ior me, iI you Slease.”
   Paul stood, wantinJ to ask why his Iather had to leave, knowinJ he had to
Slay this with the Jrand manner. He moved around to his Iather’s chair, sat
down in it.
   The Duke  turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: “Gurney, Slease
take Paul’s Slace at table. We mustn’t have an odd number here. When the
dinner’s over, I  may want you to  brinJ Paul to  the Iield  C.P. Wait Ior my
call.”
   Halleck  emerJed Irom  the alcove in  dress uniIorm, his  lumSy uJliness
seeminJ out oI Slace in the  JlitterinJ  Iinery. He  leaned his baliset aJainst
the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occuSied, sat down.
   “There’s  no need Ior alarm,” the Duke said, “but  I must ask that no one
leave until our  house Juard says it’s saIe. You will  be SerIectly secure as

164
lonJ as you remain here, and we’ll  have this little  trouble cleared uS very
shortly.”
   Paul  cauJht  the  code words  in  his  Iather’s  messaJe—Juard—saIe—
secure-shortly. The Sroblem was security,  not violence.  He saw  that his
mother had read the same messaJe. They both rela[ed.
   The Duke Jave a short nod, wheeled and strode throuJh the service door
Iollowed by his trooSer.
   Paul said:  “Please Jo on with  your dinner. I  believe Doctor  Kynes was
discussinJ water.”
   “May  we discuss it another time?” Kynes asked.”
   “By  all means,” Paul said.
   And   Jessica noted with  Sride  her son’s  diJnity,  the  mature sense oI
assurance.
   The banker Sicked uS his water IlaJon, Jestured with  it at Bewt.  “None
oI us here can surSass Master LinJar Bewt in Ilowery  Shrases. One miJht
almost assume he asSired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead
us in a toast. PerhaSs you’ve a dolloS oI wisdom Ior the boy who must be
treated like a man.”
   Jessica clenched her riJht hand into  a Iist  beneath the table. She saw a
handsiJnal Sass Irom Halleck to  Idaho, saw the house trooSers alonJ the
walls move into Sositions oI ma[imum Juard.
   Bewt cast a venomous Jlare at the banker.
   Paul  Jlanced at Halleck,  took in  the deIensive Sositions oI  his Juards,
looked at  the  banker until  the  man lowered  the  water IlaJon.  He  said:
“Once, on Caladan, I saw the body oI a drowned Iisherman recovered. He
—”
   “Drowned?”  It was the stillsuit manuIacturer’s dauJhter.
   Paul hesitated, then: “Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned. ”
   “What  an interestinJ way to die,” she murmured.
   Paul’s smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. “The
interestinJ thinJ about this man was the wounds on his shoulders—made by
another Iisherman’s claw-boots. This Iisherman was one oI several in a boat
—a craIt Ior travelinJ  on water—that Ioundered … sank beneath the water.
Another Iisherman helSinJ recover the body said he’d seen marks like this
man’s wounds several times. They meant another drowninJ Iisherman had
tried to stand on this Soor Iellow’s  shoulders in the attemSt to reach uS to
the surIace—to reach air.”

165
   “Why  is this interestinJ?” the banker asked.
   “Because oI  an observation made by my Iather at the time.  He said the
drowninJ   man  who   climbs    on  your   shoulders   to  save   himselI   is
understandable—e[ceSt when you see it haSSen in the drawinJ room.” Paul
hesitated Must lonJ enouJh Ior the banker to  see the Soint cominJ,  then:
“And, I should add, e[ceSt when you see it at the dinner table.”
   A  sudden stillness enIolded the room.
   That was rash,  Jessica thouJht. This banker might have enough rank to
call  my son out.  She saw that  Idaho was  Soised Ior  instant action.  The
House trooSers were  alert.  Gurney  Halleck   had his  eyes  on  the  men
oSSosite him.
   “Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!”    It    was  the  smuJJler,   Tuek,  head  thrown   back
lauJhinJ with comSlete abandon.
   Nervous smiles aSSeared around the table.
   Bewt was JrinninJ.
   The banker had Sushed his chair back, was JlarinJ at Paul.
   Kynes said: “One baits an Atreides at his own risk.”
   “Is  it Atreides custom to insult their Juests?” the banker demanded.
   BeIore  Paul could answer, Jessica leaned Iorward, said: “Sir!”  And she
thouJht: We must learn this Harkonnen creature’s game. Is he here to try for
Paul? Does he have help?
   “My   son disSlays a Jeneral Jarment and you claim it’s cut to  your Iit?”
Jessica asked. “What a IascinatinJ revelation.” She slid a hand down to her
leJ to the cryskniIe she had Iastened in a calI-sheath.
   The banker turned his Jlare on Jessica. Eyes shiIted away Irom Paul and
she saw him ease himselI back Irom the table, IreeinJ himselI Ior action. He
had Iocused on the code word: garment. “Prepare for violence. ”
   Kynes directed a sSeculative look at Jessica, Jave a subtle hand siJnal to
Tuek.
   The smuJJler lurched to his Ieet, liIted his IlaJon.  “I’ll   Jive you a toast,”
he said. “To younJ Paul Atreides, still a lad by  his looks, but a man by his
actions.”
   Why do they intrude? Jessica asked herselI.
   The  banker stared now  at Kynes,  and Jessica saw terror return to  the
aJent’s Iace.
   PeoSle beJan resSondinJ all around the table.

166
   Where Kynes leads,  people follow, Jessica thouJht. He  has told  us he
sides with Paul.  What’s the secret of his  power? It  can’t be because he’s
Judge of the Change. That’s temporary. And certainly  not  because he’s a
civil servant.
   She removed her hand Irom the cryskniIe hilt, liIted her IlaJon to Kynes,
who resSonded in kind.
   Only  Paul and the banker—(Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica
thouJht.)—remained emSty-handed. The banker’s attention stayed Ii[ed on
Kynes. Paul stared at his Slate.
   I  was  handling  it  correctly, Paul  thought.  Why do  they interfere?  He
Jlanced covertly at the male Juests nearest him. PreSare Ior violence? From
whom? Certainly not Irom that banker Iellow.
   Halleck  stirred,  sSoke as thouJh to  no  one in  Sarticular, directinJ  his
words over the heads oI the Juests across Irom him: “In our society, SeoSle
shouldn’t be Tuick  to take oIIense. It’s  IreTuently suicidal.”  He looked  at
the stillsuit   manuIacturer’s  dauJhter beside  him.  “Don’t   you  think   so,
miss?”
   “Oh,  yes.  Yes. Indeed I  do,”  she said. “There’s  too much  violence. It
makes me sick.  And  lots  oI  times  no oIIense  is meant,  but SeoSle die
anyway. It doesn’t make sense.”
   “Indeed it  doesn’t,” Halleck said.
   Jessica saw the near SerIection oI  the  Jirl’s  act, realized:  That empty-
headed little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the
Sattern oI the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They
had Slanned to lure Paul with  se[.  Jessica rela[ed. Her son had Srobably
been the Iirst to see it—his traininJ hadn’t overlooked that obvious Jambit.
   Kynes sSoke to the banker: “Isn’t another aSoloJy in order?”
   The  banker turned a sickly  Jrin  toward Jessica, said: “My  Lady, I  Iear
I’ve overindulJed  in your  wines. You serve Sotent drink at table, and I’m
not accustomed to it.”
   Jessica  heard the   venom  beneath his   tone,  sSoke sweetly:   “When
stranJers meet, Jreat allowance should be made Ior diIIerences oI custom
and traininJ.”
   “Thank  you, my Lady,” he said.
   The  dark-haired comSanion oI the stillsuit   manuIacturer leaned toward
Jessica, said: “The Duke  sSoke oI our beinJ  secure here. I  do hoSe that
doesn’t mean more IiJhtinJ.”

167
   She was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thouJht.
   “Likely   this will   Srove unimSortant,” Jessica said. “But there’s so much
detail reTuirinJ  the Duke’s  Sersonal attention in  these times. As lonJ  as
enmity  continues between  Atreides  and  Harkonnen  we  cannot  be too
careIul. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen aJent alive
on Arrakis,  oI  course.”  She Jlanced at  the Guild  Bank  aJent. “And  the
Conventions, naturally, suSSort him in  this.”  She shiIted  her attention to
Kynes. “Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?”
   “Indeed it  is,” Kynes said.
   The stillsuit  manuIacturer Sulled his comSanion Jently back. She looked
at him, said: “I do believe I’ll  eat somethinJ now. I’d like  some oI that bird
dish you served earlier.”
   Jessica siJnalled a  servant, turned to  the banker:  “And  you,  sir, were
sSeakinJ oI birds  earlier  and oI  their  habits. I  Iind   so many interestinJ
thinJs about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the sSice Iound? Do the hunters Jo
deeS into the desert?”
   “Oh,  no, my Lady,” he said. “Very little’s  known oI  the deeS desert. And
almost nothinJ oI the southern reJions.”
   “There’s  a tale that a  Jreat Mother Lode  oI sSice is to  be Iound in  the
southern reaches,”  Kynes  said,  “but   I  susSect it   was  an  imaJinative
invention made solely Ior  SurSoses oI a sonJ. Some darinJ sSice hunters
do, on  occasion, Senetrate into  the  edJe oI  the  central  belt,  but  that’s
e[tremely   danJerous—naviJation   is   uncertain,   storms   are  IreTuent.
Casualties increase dramatically the Iarther you oSerate Irom Shield Wall
bases. It hasn’t been Iound SroIitable to venture too Iar south. PerhaSs iI we
had a weather satellite….”
   Bewt  looked uS, sSoke around a mouthIul oI Iood: “It’s said the Fremen
travel there, that they Jo anywhere and have hunted out soaks and siS-wells
even in the southern latitudes.”
   “Soaks and siS-wells?” Jessica asked.
   Kynes sSoke Tuickly: “Wild  rumors, my Lady. These are known on other
Slanets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a Slace where water seeSs to the surIace
or near enouJh to the surIace to be Iound by  diJJinJ  accordinJ to  certain
siJns. A siS-well  is a Iorm  oI soak where a Serson draws water throuJh a
straw… so it is said.”
   There’s deception in his words, Jessica thouJht.
   Why is he lying? Paul wondered.

168
   “How   very  interestinJ,”  Jessica said. And she thouJht.  “It   is said….”
What a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it
reveals about their dependence on superstitions.
   “I’ve   heard you have a sayinJ,”  Paul said, “that Solish comes Irom  the
cities, wisdom Irom the desert.”
   “There are many sayinJs on Arrakis,” Kynes said.
   BeIore Jessica could Irame a new Tuestion, a servant bent over her with a
note. She oSened it, saw the Duke’s handwritinJ and code siJns, scanned it.
   “You’ll   all  be  deliJhted to  know,”  she said, “that  our  Duke  sends his
reassurances. The matter which  called him  away  has been  settled. The
missinJ  carryall   has  been  Iound.   A   Harkonnen   aJent  in   the   crew
overSowered the others and Ilew the machine to a smuJJlers’ base, hoSinJ
to sell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our Iorces.” She
nodded to Tuek.
   The smuJJler nodded back.
   Jessica reIolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.
   “I’m   Jlad  it  didn’t  come to oSen battle,”  the banker said. “The  SeoSle
have such hoSes the Atreides will brinJ Seace and SrosSerity.”
   “EsSecially SrosSerity,” Bewt said.
   “Shall   we have  our  dessert now?”  Jessica asked. “I’ve  had  our  cheI
SreSare a Caladan sweet: SonJi rice in sauce dolsa.”
   “It   sounds  wonderIul,”  the  stillsuit   manuIacturer said.  “Would   it  be
Sossible to Jet the reciSe?”
   “Any   reciSe  you  desire,”  Jessica said, registering  the  man  Ior  later
mention to Hawat. The stillsuit manuIacturer was a IearIul little climber and
could be bouJht.
   Small talk  resumed around her: “Such a lovely Iabric….” “He is havinJ a
settinJ  made to  match  the  Mewel….” “We  miJht   try  Ior   a  Sroduction
increase ne[t Tuarter….”
   Jessica stared down at  her Slate, thinkinJ  oI  the  coded Sart oI  Leto’s
messaJe: The Harkonnens  tried  to   get  in  a  shipment  of  lasguns.  We
captured them. This may mean they’ve succeeded with other shipments. It
certainly means they don’t  place much store in  shields. Take appropriate
precautions.
   Jessica Iocused her mind on lasJuns, wonderinJ. The white-hot beams oI
disruStive liJht   could  cut  throuJh  any  known  substance, Srovided that
substance was not shielded. The Iact  that Ieedback Irom  a  shield would

169
e[Slode both  lasJun and shield did  not  bother the Harkonnens. Why?  A
lasJun-shield e[Slosion was a danJerous variable, could be more SowerIul
than atomics, could kill only the Junner and his shielded tarJet.
   The unknowns here Iilled her with uneasiness.
   Paul said: “I  never doubted we’d Iind the carryall. Once my Iather moves
to solve a Sroblem, he solves it. This is a Iact the Harkonnens are beJinninJ
to discover.”
   He’s boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn’t boast. No person who’ll be
sleeping far below ground level this night  as a precaution against lasguns
has the right to boast.

  JESSICA HEARD   the  disturbance  in   the  Jreat  hall,  turned   on  the  liJht
beside her  bed.  The  clock   there  had not  been  SroSerly  adMusted to local
time,  and she had  to subtract  twenty-one   minutes  to determine   that it  was
about 2 A.M.
    The disturbance was  loud and incoherent.
    Is this the Harkonnen   attack? she wondered.
    She sliSSed  out  oI  bed,  checked  the screen  monitors   to see  where  her
Iamily  was.  The screen showed  Paul  asleeS in the  deeS cellar room  they’d
hastily   converted   to   a  bedroom   Ior   him.   The   noise  obviously    wasn’t
SenetratinJ to  his  Tuarters. There  was no  one in  the  Duke’s  room,  his  bed
was unrumSled. Was he still  at the Iield  C.P.?
    There were no screens yet to  the Iront  oI the house.
    Jessica stood in the middle  oI her  room, listeninJ.
    There  was one  shoutinJ,  incoherent   voice.  She  heard someone  call  Ior
Dr. Yueh. Jessica Iound  a robe, Sulled  it over  her shoulders,  Sushed her Ieet
into sliSSers, straSSed the cryskniIe  to her leJ.
    AJain,  a voice called  out Ior  Yueh.
    Jessica belted  the  robe  around  her, steSSed into   the hallway.   Then  the
thouJht struck  her: What  if Leto’s  hurt?
    The hall  seemed to stretch  out Iorever  under her  runninJ  Ieet. She turned
throuJh  the  arch   at  the  end,  dashed Sast  the  dininJ   hall   and  down  the
SassaJe to the  Great  Hall,   IindinJ   the  Slace briJhtly   liJhted,   all  the  wall
susSensors JlowinJ  at ma[imum.
    To  her  riJht   near  the  Iront   entry,  she  saw  two  house  Juards   holdinJ
Duncan  Idaho  between  them.  His  head  lolled   Iorward,   and there  was  an
abruSt, SantinJ silence to  the scene.
    One oI  the  house Juards sSoke  accusinJly  to  Idaho:  “You  see what  you
did? You woke  the Lady  Jessica.”
    The Jreat draSeries billowed   behind  the men, showinJ  that  the Iront  door
remained oSen. There was no  siJn oI  the Duke  or Yueh. MaSes stood to  one

171
side starinJ coldly  at Idaho. She wore a  lonJ brown  robe with  serSentine
desiJn at the hem. Her Ieet were Sushed into unlaced desert boots.
   “So  I woke the Lady  Jessica,” Idaho muttered. He liIted his Iace toward
the ceilinJ, bellowed: “My  sword was Iirs’ blooded on Grumman!”
   Great Mother!  He’s drunk! Jessica thouJht.
   Idaho’s  dark, round Iace was drawn into  a Irown.  His hair, curlinJ  like
the Iur oI  a black Joat, was Slastered with dirt.  A MaJJed rent in his tunic
e[Sosed an e[Sanse oI  the  dress shirt  he had  worn  at the  dinner Sarty
earlier.
   Jessica crossed to him.
   One oI the Juards nodded to her without releasinJ his hold on Idaho. “We
didn’t know  what to do with  him, my Lady. He  was creatinJ a disturbance
out Iront, reIusinJ to come inside. We were aIraid locals miJht come alonJ
and see him. That wouldn’t do at all. Give us a bad name here.”
   “Where has he been?” Jessica asked.
   “He  escorted one oI the  younJ ladies home Irom  the dinner, my  Lady.
Hawat’s orders.”
   “Which  younJ lady?”
   “One  oI the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?” He Jlanced at
MaSes, lowered his voice.  “They’re  always  callinJ  on  Idaho Ior  sSecial
surveillance oI the ladies.”
   And  Jessica thouJht: So they are. But why is he drunk?
   She Irowned,  turned to  MaSes. “MaSes, brinJ  a stimulant. I’d   suJJest
caIIeine. PerhaSs there’s some oI the sSice coIIee leIt.”
   MaSes shruJJed, headed Ior the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slaS-
slaSSed aJainst the stone Iloor.
   Idaho swunJ his unsteady head around to Seer at an anJle toward Jessica.
“Killed  more’n  three hunner’ men I‘r   the Duke,”  he muttered. “Whadduh
wanna know is why’m  mere? Can’t live  unner th’  Jroun’  here. Can’t live
onna Jroun’ here. Wha’ kinna Slace is ’iss, huh?”
   A  sound Irom  the side hall entry cauJht Jessica’s attention. She turned,
saw Yueh crossinJ to them, his medical  kit  swinJinJ  in his  leIt hand. He
was Iully  dressed, looked Sale, e[hausted. The diamond  tattoo stood out
sharSly on his Iorehead.
   “Th’   Jood docker!”  Idaho shouted. “Whad’re  you,  Doc? SSlint ‘n’  Sill
man?” He turned blearily toward Jessica. “Makin’  uh damn Iool uh m’selI,
huh?”

172
   Jessica Irowned,   remained silent,  wonderinJ:   Why  would  Idaho  get
drunk? Was he drugged?
   “Too  much sSice beer,” Idaho said, attemStinJ to straiJhten.
   MaSes returned with  a steaminJ cuS in  her hands, stoSSed uncertainly
behind Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.
   Yueh Sut  his kit  on  the Iloor,  nodded JreetinJ to  Jessica, said: “SSice
beer, eh?”
   “Bes’   damn stuII  ever tas‘ed,”  Idaho said. He  tried  to Sull  himselI  to
attention. “My  sword was Iirs’  blooded on Grumman! Killed  a Harkon  …
Harkon … killed ’im  I’r  th’ Duke.”
   Yueh  turned,  looked   at  the  cuS  in  MaSes’  hand.  “What   is  that?”
“CaIIeine,” Jessica said.
   Yueh took  the cuS, held it toward Idaho. “Drink   this, lad.”  “Don’t  wan’
any more t’ drink.”
   “Drink  it,  I say!”
   Idaho’s  head wobbled toward  Yueh, and he  stumbled one steS ahead,
draJJinJ  the Juards  with  him.  “I’m   almiJhdy   Ied  uS with  Sleasin’  th’
’MSerial Universe, Doc. Jus’ once, we’re Jonna do th’ thinJ my way.”
   “AIter  you drink  this,” Yueh said. “It’s Must caIIeine.”
   “‘SSrolly  like  all res’ uh this Slace! Damn’ sun ’stoo briJhd.  Nothin’ has
uh riJhd color. Ever’thinJ’s wronJ or….”
   “Well,  it’s  niJhttime  now,” Yueh said. He sSoke reasonably. “Drink this
like a Jood lad. It’ll  make you Ieel better.”
   “Don’  wanna Ieel bedder!”
   “We  can’t arJue with him  all niJht,”  Jessica said. And she thouJht: This
calls for shock treatment.
   “There’s no reason Ior you to stay, my Lady,” Yueh said. “I can take care
oI this.”
   Jessica shook  her head.  She steSSed Iorward, slaSSed Idaho  sharSly
across the cheek.
   He stumbled back with his Juards, JlarinJ at her.
   “This  is no way to  act in your Duke’s home,” she said. She snatched the
cuS Irom  Yueh’s hands, sSillinJ  Sart oI  it,  thrust the  cuS toward  Idaho.
“Now drink  this! That’s an order!”
   Idaho  Merked himselI uSriJht, scowlinJ down  at her. He  sSoke slowly,
with careIul  and Srecise enunciation: “I  do not take orders Irom  a damn’
Harkonnen sSy.”

173
   Yueh stiIIened, whirled to Iace Jessica.
   Her Iace had Jone Sale, but she was noddinJ. It all became clear to her—
the broken stems oI meaninJ she had seen in words and actions around her
these Sast Iew days could now be translated. She Iound herselI in the JriS oI
anJer almost too Jreat to  contain. It  took the  most SroIound oI her  Bene
Gesserit traininJ to Tuiet her Sulse and smooth her breathinJ. Even then she
could Ieel the blaze IlickerinJ.
   They were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!
   She shot a Jlance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes.
   “You  knew this?” she demanded.
   “I  … heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn’t want to add to your burdens.”
   “Hawat!”     she   snaSSed. “I    want   ThuIir    Hawat   brouJht    to   me
immediately!”
   “But,  my Lady….”
   “Immediately!”
   It  has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from
no other source without being discarded immediately.
   Idaho shook his head, mumbled. “Chuck th’  whole damn thinJ.”  Jessica
looked down  at the cuS in  her hand,  abruStly dashed its contents across
Idaho’s Iace. “Lock  him in  one oI  the Juest rooms oI the east winJ,”  she
ordered. “Let him sleep it oII.”
   The  two  Juards  stared at her  unhaSSily. One ventured:  “PerhaSs we
should take him someSlace else, m’Lady. We could….”
   “He’s  suSSosed to be here!” Jessica snaSSed. “He has a Mob to do here.”
Her voice driSSed bitterness. “He’s so Jood at watchinJ the ladies.”
   The Juard swallowed.
   “Do  you know where the Duke is?” she demanded.
   “He’s  at the command Sost, my Lady.”
   “Is  Hawat with him?”
   “Hawat’s  in the city, my Lady.”
   “You  will   brinJ  Hawat to  me at  once,” Jessica said. “I  will   be in  my
sittinJ room when he arrives.”
   “But,  my Lady….”
   “II   necessary, I  will  call  the  Duke,”  she said.  “I  hoSe it  will   not  be
necessary. I would not want to disturb him with this.”
   “Yes, my Lady.”

174
   Jessica thrust the emSty cuS into MaSes’ hands, met the TuestioninJ stare
oI the blue-within-blue eyes. “You may return to bed, MaSes.”
   “You’re  sure you’ll not need me?”
   Jessica smiled Jrimly. “I’m  sure.”
   “PerhaSs this could wait until  tomorrow,” Yueh said. “I  could Jive you a
sedative and….”
   “You  will  return to  your Tuarters and leave me to handle this my way,”
she said. She Satted his arm to take the stinJ out oI her command. “This is
the only way.”
   AbruStly,  head hiJh, she turned and stalked oII throuJh the house to her
rooms. Cold  walls…  SassaJes… a Iamiliar door….  She Merked the door
oSen, strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there JlarinJ at the
shield-blanked windows oI  her sittinJ  room. Hawat!  Could he be the one
the Harkonnens bought? We shall see.
   Jessica crossed to the deeS, old-Iashioned armchair with an embroidered
cover oI schlaJ skin,  moved the chair into  Sosition to command the door.
She was suddenly very conscious oI the cryskniIe in its sheath on her leJ.
She removed the sheath and straSSed it to her arm, tested the droS oI it.
Once more, she Jlanced around the room, SlacinJ everythinJ Srecisely in
her mind  aJainst any emerJency: the chaise near the  corner, the straiJht
chairs alonJ the wall,  the two low  tables, her stand-mounted zither beside
the door to her bedroom.
   Pale rose liJht  Jlowed Irom the susSensor lamSs. She dimmed them, sat
down in the armchair, SattinJ the uSholstery, aSSreciatinJ the chair’s reJal
heaviness Ior this occasion.
   Now, let him come, she thouJht. We shall see what we shall see. And she
SreSared herselI in the Bene Gesserit Iashion Ior  the  wait, accumulatinJ
Satience, savinJ her strenJth.
   Sooner than  she had e[Sected,  a raS sounded at the  door  and Hawat
entered at her command.
   She watched him  without  movinJ  Irom  the chair,  seeinJ the cracklinJ
sense oI druJ-induced enerJy in his movements, seeinJ the IatiJue beneath.
Hawat’s rheumy  old   eyes Jlittered.   His  leathery  skin  aSSeared Iaintly
yellow in the room’s liJht,  and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve oI
his kniIe arm.
   She smelled blood there.

175
   Jessica Jestured to one oI  the straiJht-backed chairs,  said: “BrinJ   that
chair and sit IacinJ me.”
   Hawat  bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool  of an  Idaho! he  thouJht. He
studied Jessica’s Iace, wonderinJ how he could save this situation.
   “It’s  lonJ Sast time to clear the air between us,” Jessica said.
   “What  troubles my Lady?” He sat down, Slaced hands on knees.
   “Don’t   Slay coy with  me!”  she snaSSed. “II Yueh didn’t tell  you why  I
summoned you, then one oI your sSies in my household did. Shall we be at
least that honest with each other?”
   “As  you wish, my Lady.”
   “First,   you will   answer me  one Tuestion,”  she said. “Are   you now  a
Harkonnen aJent?”
   Hawat  surJed halI out oI  his chair, his Iace dark  with Iury,  demandinJ:
“You dare insult me so?”
   “Sit  down,” she said. “You insulted me so.”
   Slowly,  he sank back into the chair.
   And  Jessica, readinJ the siJns oI this Iace that she knew so well, allowed
herselI a deeS breath. It isn’t Hawat.
   “Now   I know  you remain  loyal to  my Duke,”  she said. “I’m   SreSared,
thereIore, to IorJive your aIIront to me.”
   “Is  there somethinJ to IorJive?”
   Jessica scowled, wonderinJ: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the
Duke’s daughter I’ve carried within me these few weeks? No… Leto himself
doesn’t know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when
he must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.
   “A   Truthsayer would solve this,”  she said, “but  we have no Truthsayer
TualiIied by the HiJh Board.”
   “As  you say. We’ve no Truthsayer.”
   “Is  there a traitor  amonJ us?” she asked. “I’ve  studied our SeoSle with
Jreat care. Who  could  it  be? Not   Gurney. Certainly  not  Duncan. Their
lieutenants are not strateJically  enouJh  Slaced to consider. It’s  not  you,
ThuIir. It cannot be Paul. I know it’s not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call him
in and Sut him to the test?”
   “You  know  that’s an emSty Jesture,” Hawat said. “He’s  conditioned by
the HiJh ColleJe. That I know Ior certain.”
   “Not    to  mention  that  his   wiIe   was  a  Bene  Gesserit  slain  by   the
Harkonnens,” Jessica said.

176
   “So  that’s what haSSened to her,” Hawat said.
   “Haven’t  you heard the hate in his voice when he sSeaks the Harkonnen
name?”
   “You  know I don’t have the ear,” Hawat said.
   “What  brouJht this base susSicion on me?” she asked.
   Hawat  Irowned. “My   Lady  Suts her servant in an  imSossible Sosition.
My Iirst loyalty  is to the Duke.”
   “I’m   SreSared to IorJive much because oI that loyalty,” she said.
   “And  aJain I must ask: Is there somethinJ to IorJive?”
   “Stalemate?” she asked.
   He shruJJed.
   “Let   us discuss somethinJ else Ior a  minute, then,”  she said. “Duncan
Idaho,  the  admirable   IiJhtinJ    man  whose  abilities   at   JuardinJ   and
surveillance are so esteemed. ToniJht, he overindulJed in somethinJ called
sSice beer. I hear reSorts that others amonJ our SeoSle have been stuSeIied
by this concoction. Is that true?”
   “You  have your reSorts, my Lady.”
   “So  I do. Don’t you see this drinkinJ as a symStom, ThuIir?”
   “My  Lady sSeaks riddles.”
   “ASSly  your  Mentat abilities  to  it!”  she snaSSed. “What’s the Sroblem
with Duncan  and the others? I can tell  you  in Iour  words—they have no
home.”
   He Mabbed a IinJer at the Iloor. “Arrakis, that’s their home.”
   “Arrakis   is an unknown!  Caladan was their  home, but we’ve  uSrooted
them. They have no home. And they Iear the Duke’s IailinJ them.”
   He stiIIened. “Such talk Irom one oI the men would be cause Ior—”
   “Oh,   stoS that,  ThuIir.  Is  it   deIeatist or  treacherous Ior   a doctor  to
diaJnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.”
   “The  Duke Jives me charJe over such matters.”
   “But  you understand I have a certain natural concern over the SroJress oI
this disease,” she said. “And  SerhaSs you’ll Jrant  I  have certain abilities
alonJ these lines.”
   Will  I have to shock him sererely? she wondered. He needs shaking up—
something to break him from routine.
   “There  could be many interSretations Ior your concern,” Hawat said. He
shruJJed.
   “Then  you’ve already convicted me?”

177
   “OI   course not, my Lady.  But I  cannot aIIord  to take any chances, the
situation beinJ what it is.”
   “A  threat to my son Jot Sast you riJht here in this house,” she said. “Who
took that chance?”
   His Iace darkened. “I oIIered my resiJnation to the Duke.”
   “Did  you oIIer your resiJnation to me… or to Paul?”
   Now  he  was oSenly  anJry, betrayinJ  it  in  Tuickness oI  breathinJ,  in
dilation oI nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a Sulse beatinJ at his temSle.
   “I’m   the Duke’s man,” he said, bitinJ oII the words.
   “There  is no  traitor,”  she said. “The threat’s somethinJ else. PerhaSs it
has to do with the lasJuns. PerhaSs they’ll risk secretinJ a Iew lasJuns with
timinJ mechanisms aimed at house shields. PerhaSs they’ll….”
   “And  who  could tell  aIter the blast iI  the e[Slosion  wasn’t atomic?”  he
asked. “No,  my  Lady.  They’ll   not  risk  anythinJ  that  illeJal.   Radiation
linJers. The  evidence is  hard to  erase. No. They’ll   observe most oI  the
Iorms. It has to be a traitor.”
   “You’re  the  Duke’s man,”  she sneered. “Would you destroy him  in the
eIIort to save him?”
   He  took a deeS breath, then: “II  you’re  innocent, you’ll   have my most
abMect aSoloJies.”
   “Look   at you now, ThuIir,”  she said. “Humans live  best when each has
his own Slace, when each knows where he belonJs in the scheme oI thinJs.
Destroy the Slace and destroy the Serson. You and I,  ThuIir,  oI all  those
who love the Duke,  are most ideally situated to  destroy the other’s Slace.
Could I  not  whisSer susSicions about you  into the  Duke’s  ear at niJht?
When would  he be most  susceStible to such whisSerinJ, ThuIir?  Must  I
draw it Ior you more clearly?”
   “You  threaten me?” he Jrowled.
   “Indeed  not.  I  merely  Soint out  to  you  that  someone is attackinJ  us
throuJh the basic arranJement oI our lives. It’s clever, diabolical. I SroSose
to neJate this attack by so orderinJ our lives  that there’ll  be no chinks Ior
such barbs to enter.”
   “You  accuse me oI whisSerinJ baseless susSicions?”
   “Baseless, yes.”
   “You’d  meet this with your own whisSers?”
   “Your  liIe is comSounded oI whisSers, not mine, ThuIir.”
   “Then  you Tuestion my abilities?”

178
   She  siJhed.  “ThuIir,    I   want  you  to   e[amine   your  own   emotional
involvement in  this.  The natural  human’s an animal  without  loJic.  Your
SroMections oI loJic onto all aIIairs is unnatural, but suIIered to continue Ior
its  useIulness. You’re  the  embodiment  oI   loJic—a   Mentat.  Yet,  your
Sroblem solutions are  conceSts that, in  a very  real  sense, are SroMected
outside yourselI, there to be studied and rolled around, e[amined  Irom all
sides.”
   “You  think  now to teach me my trade?” he asked, and he did not try  to
hide the disdain in his voice.
   “AnythinJ   outside yourselI, this you can see and aSSly your loJic to it,”
she said. “But it’s a human trait that when we encounter Sersonal Sroblems,
those thinJs most deeSly Sersonal are the most diIIicult to brinJ out Ior our
loJic  to  scan. We  tend to  Ilounder  around, blaminJ  everythinJ  but  the
actual, deeS-seated thinJ that’s really chewinJ on us.”
   “You’re  deliberately attemStinJ to undermine my Iaith  in my abilities  as
a Mentat,” he rasSed. “Were I to Iind one oI  our SeoSle attemStinJ thus to
sabotaJe any other weaSon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce
and destroy him.”
   “The  Iinest  Mentats have a healthy resSect Ior the error  Iactor in  their
comSutations,” she said.
   “I’ve  never said otherwise!”
   “Then  aSSly yourselI to these symStoms we’ve both seen: drunkenness
amonJ the men,  Tuarrels—they JossiS and e[chanJe  wild  rumors  about
Arrakis; they iJnore the most simSle—”
   “Idleness, no more,”  he said. “Don’t  try to  divert my attention by  tryinJ
to make a simSle matter aSSear mysterious.”
   She  stared at  him,   thinkinJ  oI   the  Duke’s  men rubbinJ   their  woes
toJether in the barracks until you could almost smell the charJe there, like
burnt insulation. They’re becoming like the men of the pre-Guild legend, she
thouJht: Like the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros-sick at their guns
—foreverseeking, forever prepared and forever unready.
   “Why  have you never made Iull use oI my abilities in your service to the
Duke?” she asked. “Do you Iear a rival Ior your Sosition?”
   He Jlared at her, the old eyes blazinJ. “I  know some oI the traininJ they
Jive you Bene Gesserit….” He broke oII, scowlinJ.
   “Go  ahead, say it,” she said. “Bene Gesserit witches.”

179
   “I  know somethinJ oI the real traininJ they Jive you,”  he said. “I’ve seen
it come out in Paul. I’m not Iooled by what your schools tell the Sublic: you
e[ist only to serve.”
   The shock must be severe and he’s almost ready for it, she thouJht.
   “You  listen  resSectIully to  me in  Council,”  she said, “yet   you seldom
heed my advice. Why?”
   “I  don’t  trust your Bene Gesserit motives,” he said. “You may think you
can look throuJh  a man; you  may think  you can make a man  do e[actly
what you—”
   “You  Soor fool, ThuIir!”  she raJed.
   He scowled, SushinJ himselI back in the chair.
   “Whatever  rumors you’ve heard about our schools,” she said, “the truth
is Iar Jreater. II I wished to destroy the Duke… or you, or any other Serson
within my reach, you could not stoS me.”
   And  she thouJht: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is
not the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.
   Hawat sliSSed a hand beneath his tunic where he keSt a tiny SroMector oI
Soison darts. She wears no shield, he thouJht. Is this just a brag she makes?
I could slay her now… but, ah-h-h-h, the conseTuences if I’m wrong.
   Jessica saw the Jesture toward his  Socket, said: “Let  us Sray  violence
shall never be necessary between us.”
   “A  worthy Srayer,” he aJreed.
   “Meanwhile,  the sickness sSreads amonJ us,” she said. “I must ask you
aJain: Isn’t it more reasonable to suSSose the Harkonnens have Slanted this
susSicion to Sit the two oI us aJainst each other?”
   “We aSSear to’ve returned to stalemate,” he said.
   She siJhed, thinkinJ: He’s almost ready for it.
   “The  Duke  and I  are Iather and mother  surroJates to our SeoSle,” she
said. “The Sosition—”
   “He  hasn’t married you,” Hawat said.
   She Iorced herselI to calmness, thinkinJ: A good riposte, that.
   “But  he’ll  not marry  anyone else,” she said. “Not as lonJ as I live.  And
we are surroJates, as I’ve said. To break uS this natural order in our aIIairs,
to  disturb,   disruSt,  and  conIuse  us—which   tarJet  oIIers   itselI   most
enticinJly to the Harkonnens?”
   He  sensed the direction she was takinJ, and his brows drew  down in  a
lowerinJ scowl.

180
   “The   Duke?”  she asked. “Attractive   tarJet, yes,  but no  one  with  the
Sossible e[ceStion oI Paul is better Juarded. Me? I temSt them, surely, but
they must  know the  Bene Gesserit make diIIicult   tarJets. And  there’s  a
better tarJet, one whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind sSot.
One to whom susSicion is as natural as breathinJ. One who builds his entire
liIe  on  innuendo and  mystery.”  She darted her  riJht  hand  toward him.
“You!”
   Hawat started to leaS Irom his chair.
   “I  have not dismissed you, ThuIir!” she Ilared.
   The old Mentat almost Iell back into the chair, so Tuickly did his muscles
betray him.
   She smiled without mirth.
   “Now  you know somethinJ oI the real traininJ they Jive us,” she said.
   Hawat  tried to  swallow  in a  dry throat.  Her command had been reJal,
SeremStory—uttered in  a  tone  and  manner  he  had  Iound  comSletely
irresistible.  His  body  had  obeyed her  beIore  he  could  think   about it.
NothinJ  could  have  Srevented his  resSonse—not loJic,  not  Sassionate
anJer… nothinJ. To  do what she had done sSoke oI  a sensitive, intimate
knowledJe oI  the Serson thus commanded, a deSth oI control he had not
dreamed Sossible.
   “I   have said to you  beIore that we  should understand each other,” she
said. “I meant you should understand me. I already understand you. And I
tell you now that your loyalty  to the Duke is all that Juarantees your saIety
with me.”
   He stared at her, wet his liSs with his tonJue.
   “II   I desired a SuSSet, the Duke would marry me,” she said. “He  miJht
even think he did it oI his own Iree will.”
   Hawat lowered  his head, looked uSward throuJh his sSarse lashes. Only
the most riJid  control keSt him Irom  callinJ  the Juard. Control…  and the
susSicion now that woman miJht  not Sermit it.  His skin  crawled with  the
memory oI how  she had controlled him. In  the moment oI  hesitation, she
could have drawn a weaSon and killed him!
   Does every human have this blind spot? he wondered. Can any of us be
ordered into  action  before he can  resist? The  idea staggered him.  Who
could stop a person with such power?
   “You’ve   JlimSsed the  Iist  within   the Bene Gesserit  Jlove,”  she said.
“Few JlimSse it  and live. And what  I did was a relatively  simSle thinJ Ior

181
us. You’ve not seen my entire arsenal. Think on that.”
   “Why  aren’t you out destroyinJ the Duke’s enemies?” he asked.
   “What  would  you  have me destroy?” she asked. “Would  you have me
make a weaklinJ oI our Duke, have him Iorever leaninJ on me?”
   “But,  with such Sower….”
   “Power’s  a two-edJed sword, ThuIir,”   she said. “You think:  ‘How  easy
Ior her to shaSe a human tool to thrust into an enemy’s vitals.’ True, ThuIir;
even into your vitals. Yet, what would  I accomSlish? II enouJh oI us Bene
Gesserit did this,  wouldn’t  it  make  all Bene  Gesserit susSect? We don’t
want that, ThuIir. We do not  wish to destroy ourselves.” She nodded. “We
truly e[ist  only to serve.”
   “I  cannot answer you,” he said. “You know I cannot answer.”
   “You’ll   say nothinJ about what has haSSened here to anyone,” she said.
“I know you, ThuIir.”
   “My  Lady….”  AJain  the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat.
   And  he thouJht: She has Jreat Sowers, yes. But would these not make her
an even more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?
   “The   Duke  could  be  destroyed as Tuickly   by  his  Iriends  as by   his
enemies,” she said. “I trust now  you’ll  Jet to  the bottom oI  this susSicion
and remove it.”
   “II  it  Sroves baseless,” he said.
   “If,”    she sneered.
   “II,”   he said.
   “You  are tenacious,” she said.
   “Cautious,”  he said, “and aware oI the error Iactor.”
   “Then  I’ll  Sose another Tuestion Ior you: What does it mean to you that
you stand beIore another human, that you are bound and helSless and the
other human holds a  kniIe  at your  throat—yet this  other human  reIrains
Irom killinJ  you, Irees you Irom  your bonds and Jives you the kniIe to use
as you will?”
   She liIted  herselI out oI the chair, turned her back on him. “You  may Jo
now, ThuIir.”
   The old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeSinJ toward the deadly weaSon
beneath his tunic. He was reminded oI the bull rinJ and oI the Duke’s Iather
(who’d been brave, no matter  what his other IailinJs)  and one day  oI the
corrida  lonJ  aJo:  The Iierce  black  beast had stood  there, head bowed,
immobilized and conIused. The Old Duke had turned his back on the horns,

182
caSe thrown Ilamboyantly over one arm, while cheers rained down Irom the
stands.
   I  am the bull and she the matador, Hawat thouJht. He withdrew his hand
Irom the weaSon, Jlanced at the sweat JlisteninJ in his emSty Salm.
   And  he knew that whatever the Iacts Sroved to be in the end, he would
never IorJet this moment nor lose this sense oI suSreme admiration Ior the
Lady Jessica.
   Quietly, he turned and leIt the room.
   Jessica lowered her Jaze Irom the reIlection in the windows, turned, and
stared at the closed door.
   “Now  we’ll  see some SroSer action,” she whisSered.

183
        Do you wrestle with dreams? Do you contend with shadows? Do you move in a kind of sleep?
        Time has slipped away. Your life is stolen. You tarried with trifles, Victim of your folly.
         —DirJe for Jamis on the Funeral Plain, from “SonJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  LETO STOOD in  the  Ioyer  oI  his house,  studyinJ  a note  by  the liJht   oI a
sinJle  susSensor lamS.  Dawn  was  yet  a  Iew  hours  away,  and  he Ielt   his
tiredness. A  Fremen messenJer had brouJht   the note to  the outer Juard  Must
now as the Duke  arrived Irom  his command  Sost.
    The note read: “A   column oI  smoke by  day, a Sillar oI  Iire  by niJht.”
    There was no siJnature.
    What does it mean?  he wondered.
    The  messenJer had  Jone  without   waitinJ   Ior  an  answer  and beIore  he
could  be   Tuestioned.  He   had  sliSSed  into   the   niJht   like   some  smoky
shadow.
    Leto  Sushed the SaSer into  a tunic  Socket, thinkinJ   to  show  it  to Hawat
later. He  brushed  a lock  oI   hair  Irom  his  Iorehead,  took  a siJhinJ   breath.
The antiIatiJue   Sills  were  beJinninJ   to  wear  thin.  It  had been  a lonJ  two
days since the dinner Sarty  and lonJer than  that since he had sleSt.
    On toS  oI all  the  military   Sroblems, there’d  been  the disTuietinJ   session
with  Hawat, the reSort on  his meetinJ  with  Jessica.
    Should  I  waken  Jessica?  he  wondered.  There’s  no  reason  to   play  the
secrecy game with her  any longer. Or  is there?
    Blast and damn  that Duncan  Idaho!
    He shook his  head. No, not  Duncan.  I was  wrong not  to take  Jessica into
my confidence from  the first.  I must do it  now, before more  damage is done.
    The decision  made him  Ieel better, and  he hurried  Irom  the Ioyer  throuJh
the Great Hall  and down  the SassaJes toward the Iamily  winJ.
    At  the  turn  where  the  SassaJes sSlit  to  the service  area,  he Saused.  A
stranJe mewlinJ   came Irom  somewhere down  the service  SassaJe. Leto Sut
his leIt   hand  to the  switch   on his  shield   belt,  sliSSed his  kindMal into  his
riJht  hand. The  kniIe  conveyed  a sense oI  reassurance. That stranJe  sound
had sent a chill  throuJh him.
    SoItly,  the Duke  moved down  the service SassaJe, cursinJ  the inadeTuate
illumination.    The   smallest   oI  susSensors  had  been  sSaced  about   eiJht

184
meters aSart alonJ here and tuned to their dimmest level.  The dark stone
walls swallowed the liJht.
   A  dull blob stretchinJ across the Iloor aSSeared out oI the Jloom ahead.
   Leto  hesitated, almost  activated his  shield, but  reIrained  because that
would  limit   his   movements, his   hearinJ…  and  because the  caStured
shiSment oI lasJuns had leIt him Iilled with doubts.
   Silently,  he moved toward the Jrey blob, saw that it was a human IiJure,
a man Iace down  on  the stone. Leto  turned him  over with  a  Ioot,  kniIe
Soised, bent close in the  dim  liJht  to  see the Iace. It  was the smuJJler,
Tuek, a  wet   stain down   his  chest. The  dead  eyes stared  with  emSty
darkness. Leto touched the stain—warm.
   How could this man be dead here? Leto asked himself. Who killed him?
   The mewlinJ  sound was louder here. It came Irom  ahead and down the
side SassaJe to the central room where they had installed the main shield
Jenerator Ior the house.
   Hand on  belt switch,  kindMal Soised, the Duke skirted the body, sliSSed
down the SassaJe and Seered around the corner toward the shield Jenerator
room.
   Another  Jrey blob  lay stretched on the Iloor  a Iew  Saces away, and he
saw at once this was the source oI the noise. The shaSe crawled toward him
with SainIul slowness, JasSinJ, mumblinJ.
   Leto  stilled  his  sudden constriction  oI  Iear, darted down  the SassaJe,
crouched  beside   the  crawlinJ    IiJure.    It   was   MaSes,   the  Fremen
housekeeSer, her hair tumbled around her Iace, clothinJ disarrayed. A dull
shininess oI dark stain sSread Irom her back alonJ her side. He touched her
shoulder and she liIted herselI on her elbows, head tiSSed uS to Seer at him,
the eyes black-shadowed emStiness.
   “S‘you,”   she JasSed. “Killed… Juard… sent… Jet…  Tuek … escaSe…
m’Lady  …  you…  you…  here …  no….”  She IloSSed Iorward,  her head
thumSinJ aJainst the stone.
   Leto Ielt  Ior Sulse at the temSles. There was none. He looked at the stain:
she’d been stabbed in  the  back.  Who? His  mind  raced.  Did  she mean
someone had killed a Juard? And Tuek—had Jessica sent Ior him? Why?
   He  started to stand uS. A  si[th   sense warned him. He  Ilashed a hand
toward the  shield switch—too  late.  A  numbinJ  shock slammed his  arm
aside. He Ielt  Sain there,  saw a dart  SrotrudinJ  Irom  the sleeve, sensed

185
Saralysis sSreadinJ Irom it uS his arm. It took an aJonizinJ eIIort to liIt his
head and look down the SassaJe.
   Yueh stood in  the oSen door oI  the Jenerator room.  His Iace  reIlected
yellow Irom  the liJht  oI a sinJle, briJhter  susSensor above the door. There
was stillness Irom the room behind him—no sound oI Jenerators.
   Yueh! Leto  thouJht. He’s  sabotaged the house generators! We’re wide
open!
   Yueh beJan walkinJ toward him, SocketinJ a dartJun.
   Leto   Iound  he  could  still   sSeak,  JasSed: “Yueh!  How?”   Then  the
Saralysis reached his leJs and he slid to  the Iloor  with  his  back SroSSed
aJainst the stone wall.
   Yueh’s Iace  carried a look  oI  sadness as he bent over, touched Leto’s
Iorehead. The Duke Iound  he could Ieel  the touch, but  it  was remote …
dull.
   “The  druJ  on the dart is selective,”  Yueh said. “You can sSeak, but I’d
advise aJainst it.”  He  Jlanced down  the hall,  and aJain  bent over Leto,
Sulled out the dart, tossed it aside. The sound oI the dart clatterinJ on  the
stones was Iaint and distant to the Duke’s ears.
   It  can’t be Yueh, Leto thouJht. He’s conditioned.
   “How?”  Leto whisSered.
   “I’m   sorry, my dear Duke, but there are thinJs  which will  make Jreater
demands than this.” He touched the diamond tattoo on his Iorehead. “I Iind
it very stranJe, myselI—an override on my Syretic conscience—but I wish
to kill a man. Yes, I actually wish it. I will  stoS at nothinJ to do it.”
   He  looked down at the  Duke. “Oh,  not you, my  dear Duke. The Baron
Harkonnen. I wish to kill the Baron.”
   “Bar  … on Har….”
   “Be  Tuiet, Slease, my Soor Duke. You haven’t much time. That SeJ tooth
I Sut in your mouth aIter the tumble at Narcal—that tooth must be reSlaced.
In  a moment,  I’ll   render  you  unconscious and  reSlace that tooth.”   He
oSened his hand, stared at somethinJ in  it.  “An  e[act  duSlicate, its  core
shaSed most e[Tuisitely like a nerve. It’ll escaSe the usual detectors, even a
Iast scanninJ. But  iI  you bite  down  hard on it,  the  cover crushes. Then,
when you  e[Sel  your breath sharSly, you  Iill   the air  around you  with  a
Soison Jas—most deadly.”
   Leto   stared  uS  at   Yueh,  seeinJ  madness in   the   man’s  eyes,  the
SersSiration alonJ brow and chin.

186
   “You  were dead anyway, my Soor Duke,”  Yueh said. “But  you will  Jet
close to the Baron beIore you die. He’ll  believe you’re  stuSeIied by druJs
beyond any dyinJ eIIort to attack him. And you  will  be druJJed—and tied.
But attack can take stranJe Iorms. And  you will  remember the tooth. The
tooth, Duke Leto Atreides. You will remember the tooth.”
   The  old  doctor  leaned closer  and closer  until  his  Iace  and drooSinJ
mustache dominated Leto’s narrowinJ vision.
   “The  tooth,” Yueh muttered.
   “Why?”  Leto whisSered.
   Yueh lowered himselI  to one knee beside the Duke. “I  made a shaitan’s
barJain with the Baron. And I must be certain he has IulIilled his halI oI  it.
When I see him, I’ll  know. When I look at the Baron, then I will  know. But
I’ll  never enter his  Sresence without the Srice. You’re the Srice, my  Soor
Duke. And  I’ll   know  when I  see him. My   Soor Wanna tauJht me many
thinJs, and one is to see certainty oI truth when the stress is Jreat. I cannot
do it always, but when I see the Baron—then, I will know.”
   Leto  tried  to look  down  at the  tooth in  Yueh’s hand. He  Ielt  this was
haSSeninJ in a niJhtmare—it could not be.
   Yueh’s SurSle liSs turned uS in a Jrimace. “I’ll    not Jet close enouJh to
the Baron, or I’d do this myselI.  No. I’ll  be detained at a saIe distance. But
you… ah, now!  You, my lovely  weaSon! He’ll  want you close to him—to
Jloat over you, to boast a little.”
   Leto  Iound  himselI almost  hySnotized by a muscle  on the leIt  side oI
Yueh’s Maw. The muscle twisted when the man sSoke.
   Yueh leaned closer. “And  you, my  Jood Duke, my  Srecious Duke, you
must remember this tooth.” He held it uS between thumb and IoreIinJer. “It
will be all that remains to you.”
   Leto’s mouth moved without sound, then: “ReIuse.”
   “Ah-h,  no!  You mustn’t reIuse. Because, in return Ior this small service,
I’m doinJ  a thinJ Ior  you. I  will  save your son and your woman. No other
can do it. They can be removed to a Slace where no Harkonnen can reach
them.”
   “How…  save… them?” Leto whisSered.
   “By  makinJ it  aSSear they’re dead, by secretinJ them amonJ SeoSle who
draw kniIe  at hearinJ the  Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so
much they’ll  burn  a chair in  which  a Harkonnen has sat, salt the Jround

187
over which a Harkonnen has walked.” He touched Leto’s Maw. “Can you Ieel
anythinJ in your Maw?”
   The Duke Iound that he could not answer. He sensed distant tuJJinJ, saw
Yueh’s hand come uS with the ducal siJnet rinJ.
   “For  Paul,”  Yueh said. “You’ll   be unconscious Sresently. Good-by, my
Soor Duke. When ne[t we meet we’ll have no time Ior conversation.”
   Cool  remoteness sSread uSward Irom Leto’s Maw, across his cheeks. The
shadowy hall narrowed to a SinSoint with Yueh’s SurSle liSs centered in it.
   “Remember the tooth!” Yueh hissed. “The tooth!”

188
        There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop
        psychic muscles.

  JESSICA AWOKE  in  the dark,  IeelinJ   Sremonition  in  the stillness  around
her. She could not  understand why  her mind  and body  Ielt so sluJJish.   Skin
rasSinJs oI  Iear ran alonJ  her  nerves. She thouJht  oI  sittinJ  uS and  turninJ
on a liJht,  but somethinJ  stayed the decision.  Her mouth  Ielt…  stranJe.
    Lump-lump-lump-lump!
    It was a dull  sound, directionless  in  the dark. Somewhere.
    The  waitinJ   moment   was  Sacked with   time,   with   rustlinJ   needlestick
movements.
    She beJan to Ieel  her body,  Jrew aware  oI bindinJs  on  wrists  and ankles,
a JaJ in  her mouth.  She  was on her  side, hands tied  behind  her. She tested
the bindinJs,  realized  they  were krimskell   Iiber,  would  only  claw  tiJhter  as
she Sulled.
    And now,  she remembered.
    There  had been  movement  in  the  darkness  oI  her  bedroom,  somethinJ
wet and SunJent slaSSed aJainst her  Iace, IillinJ   her mouth,  hands JrasSinJ
Ior  her. She had  JasSed—one indrawn   breath—sensinJ  the  narcotic  in  the
wetness. Consciousness had receded, sinkinJ  her into  a black bin  oI terror.
    It has come, she thouJht.  How  simple  it was to  subdue the Bene Gesserit.
All it  took was treachery.  Hawat  was right.
    She Iorced herselI  not to Sull  on her bindinJs.
    This is not  my bedroom, she thought.  They’ve taken me someplace else.
    Slowly,  she marshaled the inner  calmness.
    She Jrew  aware  oI  the  smell  oI  her  own  stale  sweat  with  its  chemical
inIusion  oI Iear.
    Where is Paul?  she asked herselI. My  son—what have they done to  him?
    Calmness.
    She Iorced herselI  to it,  usinJ the ancient  routines.
    But terror  remained so near.
    Leto? Where are you,  Leto?

189
   She sensed a diminishinJ in the dark. It beJan with shadows. Dimensions
seSarated, became new thorns oI awareness. White. A line under a door.
   I’m  on the floor.
   PeoSle walkinJ. She sensed it throuJh the Iloor.
   Jessica sTueezed back the memory oI terror. I must remain calm,  alert,
and prepared. I   may get  only  one chance. AJain,  she  Iorced the  inner
calmness.
   The unJainly  thumSinJ oI  her heartbeats evened, shaSinJ out time. She
counted back. I   was unconscious about  an  hour.  She closed  her eyes,
Iocused her awareness onto the aSSroachinJ IootsteSs.
   Four  people.
   She counted the diIIerences in their steSs.
   I  must pretend I’m still  unconscious. She rela[ed aJainst the cold Iloor,
testinJ her  body’s  readiness, heard a door  oSen, sensed increased liJht
throuJh her eyelids.
   Feet aSSroached: someone standinJ over her.
   “You  are awake,” rumbled a basso voice. “Do not Sretend.”
   She oSened her eyes.
   The  Baron   Vladimir   Harkonnen  stood  over  her. Around   them,  she
recoJnized the cellar room where Paul had sleSt, saw his cot at one side—
emSty. SusSensor lamSs were brouJht in by  Juards, distributed near  the
oSen door. There was a Jlare oI liJht  in  the hallway beyond that hurt  her
eyes.
   She looked uS at the Baron. He wore a yellow caSe that bulJed over his
Sortable susSensors. The Iat cheeks were two  cherubic mounds  beneath
sSider-black eyes.
   “The  druJ was timed,” he rumbled. “We knew to the minute when you’d
be cominJ out oI it.”
   How could that be? she wondered. They’d have to know my exact weight,
my metabolism, my…. Yueh!
   “Such  a Sity you must remain JaJJed,” the Baron said. “We  could have
such an interestinJ conversation.”
   Yueh’s the only one it could be, she thouJht. How?
   The Baron Jlanced behind him at the door. “Come in, Piter.”
   She  had never beIore  seen the man  who  entered to  stand beside the
Baron, but the Iace was known—and the man: Piter  de Vries, the Mentat-
Assassin. She studied him—hawk Ieatures, blue-ink eyes that suJJested he

190
was a native oI Arrakis, but subtleties oI  movement and stance told her he
was not. And his Ilesh was too well Iirmed  with water. He was tall, thouJh
slender, and somethinJ about him suJJested eIIeminacy.
   “Such  a Sity we  cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady  Jessica,”
the Baron said. “However, I’m  aware oI your  abilities.”  He Jlanced at the
Mentat. “Isn’t that true, Piter?”
   “As  you say, Baron,” the man said.
   The voice  was tenor. It touched her sSine with a wash oI  coldness. She
had never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit traininJ,
the voice screamed: Killer!
   “I  have a surSrise Ior Piter,” the Baron said. “He thinks he has come here
to collect his reward—you, Lady Jessica. But I wish to demonstrate a thinJ:
that he does not really want you.”
   “You  Slay with me, Baron?” Piter asked, and he smiled.
   SeeinJ that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leaS to deIend
himselI Irom  this  Piter. Then she corrected herselI. The Baron  could not
read that smile. He did not have the TraininJ.
   “In  many ways, Piter is  Tuite naive,” the Baron said. “He  doesn’t admit
to himselI what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I’d show him, but
it’d be a Ioolish risk.”  The Baron smiled at Piter, whose Iace had become a
waitinJ mask. “I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants Sower.”
   “You  Sromised I  could have  her,” Piter  said. The tenor  voice had lost
some oI its cold reserve.
   Jessica heard the clue-tones in the man’s voice, allowed herselI an inward
shudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?
   “I  Jive you a choice, Piter,” the Baron said.
   “What  choice?”
   The   Baron  snaSSed Iat  IinJers.   “This   woman  and  e[ile   Irom   the
ImSerium, or the Duchy oI Atreides on Arrakis  to rule as you see Iit in my
name.”
   Jessica watched the Baron’s sSider eyes study Piter.
   “You  could be Duke here in all but name,” the Baron said.
   Is my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herselI. She Ielt a silent wail beJin
somewhere in her mind.
   The Baron keSt his attention on the Mentat. “Understand yourselI, Piter.
You want her because she was a Duke’s woman, a symbol oI his Sower—
beautiIul, useIul, e[Tuisitely trained Ior her role. But  an entire duchy, Piter!

191
That’s more than a symbol; that’s the reality. With it  you could have many
women… and more.”
   “You  do not Moke with Piter?”
   The  Baron turned with  that dancinJ liJhtness the susSensors Jave him.
“Joke? I? Remember—I am JivinJ  uS the boy. You heard what the traitor
said about the lad’s traininJ. They are alike, this mother and son—deadly.”
The Baron smiled. “I must Jo now. I will send in the Juard I’ve reserved Ior
this moment. He’s stone deaI. His orders will be to convey you on the Iirst
leJ oI  your Mourney into e[ile.  He will   subdue this woman iI  he sees her
Jain control oI  you. He’ll  not  Sermit you to untie  her JaJ until  you’re oII
Arrakis. II you choose not to leave … he has other orders.”
   “You  don’t have to leave,” Piter said. “I’ve chosen.”
   “Ah,  hah!”  the Baron chortled. “Such Tuick decision can mean only one
thinJ.”
   “I  will  take the duchy,” Piter said.
   And  Jessica thouJht: Doesn’t Piter know the Baron’s lying to him? But—
how could he know? He’s a twisted Mentat.
   The Baron Jlanced down at Jessica. “Is it not wonderIul that I know Piter
so well?  I  waJered with  my  Master  at Arms  that  this  would  be Piter’s
choice. Hah! Well, I leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You
understand, Lady Jessica? I had  no rancor  toward  you. It’s  a  necessity.
Much better this  way. Yes. And  I’ve  not actually  ordered you  destroyed.
When it’s asked oI me what haSSened to you, I can shruJ it oII in all truth.”
   “You  leave it to me then?” Piter asked.
   “The   Juard   I   send  you   will   take   your   orders,”  the   Baron  said.
“Whatever’s done I leave to you.” He stared at Piter. “Yes. There will be no
blood on my hands here. It’s your decision. Yes. I know nothinJ  oI it.  You
will  wait until  I’ve  Jone beIore doinJ  whatever you must do. Yes. Well…
ah, yes. Yes. Good.”
   He fears the Tuestioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h,
the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her
Tuestions, then the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah-h-h-h, my poor Leto.
   With  one last Jlance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She
Iollowed him  with  her eyes, thinkinJ: It’s as the Reverend Mother warned
—toopotent an adversary.
   Two   Harkonnen trooSers  entered. Another,  his  Iace  a  scared mask,
Iollowed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasJun.

192
   The  deaf one,  Jessica thouJht, studyinJ   the scarred Iace.  The Baron
knows I could use the Voice on any other man.
   ScarIace looked at  Piter. “We’ve  the boy  on a  litter  outside. What are
your orders?”
   Piter sSoke to Jessica. “I’d thouJht  oI bindinJ  you by a threat held over
your son, but I beJin to see that would not have worked. I let emotion cloud
reason. Bad Solicy Ior  a Mentat.”  He looked  at the Iirst  Sair oI  trooSers,
turninJ so the deaI one could read his liSs: “Take them into the desert as the
traitor  suJJested Ior  the boy.  His  Slan is  a  Jood one.  The worms  will
destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be Iound.”
   “You  don’t wish to disSatch them yourselI?” ScarIace asked.
   He reads lips, Jessica thouJht.
   “I  Iollow  my  Baron’s e[amSle,” Piter said. “Take them where the traitor
said.”
   Jessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter’s voice, thouJht: He, too,
fears the Truthsayer.
   Piter shruJJed, turned, and went throuJh the doorway. He hesitated there,
and Jessica thouJht he miJht turn back Ior a last look at her, but he went out
without turninJ.
   “Me,   I  wouldn’t   like  the thouJht  oI  IacinJ   that Truthsayer aIter  this
niJht’s work,”  ScarIace said.
   “You   ain’t  likely   ever to  run  into   that old  witch,”   one  oI  the  other
trooSers said. He went  around to  Jessica’s head, bent over her.”  It  ain’t
JettinJ our  work done standinJ around here chatterinJ. Take her Ieet  and
—”
   “Why‘n’t   we kill  ’em here?” ScarIace asked.
   “Too  messy,” the Iirst one said. “Unless you wants to stranJle ‘em. Me, I
likes a nice straiJhtIorward Mob. DroS ’em on the desert like that traitor said,
cut ’em once or twice, leave the evidence Ior the worms. NothinJ  to clean
uS aIterwards.”
   “Yeah… well,  I Juess you’re riJht,” ScarIace said.
   Jessica listened to them, watchinJ, reJisterinJ.  But the JaJ  blocked her
Voice, and there was the deaI one to consider.
   ScarIace holstered his lasJun, took her Ieet. They liIted her like a sack oI
Jrain, maneuvered her throuJh the door and dumSed her onto a susSensor-
buoyed litter with  another bound IiJure.  As they  turned her, IittinJ  her to
the litter,  she saw  her comSanion’s Iace—Paul!  He was  bound, but  not

193
JaJJed. His Iace was no more than ten centimeters Irom hers, eyes closed,
his breathinJ even.
   Is he drugged? she wondered.
   The trooSers liIted the litter, and Paul’s eyes oSened the smallest Iraction
—dark slits starinJ at her.
   He mustn’t try the Voice! she Srayed. The deaf guard!
   Paul’s eyes closed.
   He  had  been  SracticinJ  the  awareness-breathinJ, calminJ  his  mind,
listeninJ to their caStors. The deaI one Sosed a Sroblem, but Paul contained
his desSair. The mind-calminJ Bene Gesserit reJimen his mother had tauJht
him keSt him Soised, ready to e[Sand any oSSortunity.
   Paul  allowed himselI  another slit-eyed insSection oI  his mother’s Iace.
She aSSeared unharmed. GaJJed, thouJh.
   He  wondered who could’ve  caStured her. His  own caStivity  was Slain
enouJh—to bed with a caSsule Srescribed by Yueh, awakinJ to Iind himselI
bound to this litter. PerhaSs a similar thinJ had beIallen her. LoJic said the
traitor was  Yueh, but  he held  Iinal  decision in  abeyance. There was no
understandinJ it—a Suk doctor a traitor.
   The  litter   tiSSed  sliJhtly   as the  Harkonnen  trooSers maneuvered  it
throuJh a doorway into  starlit  niJht. A  susSensor-buoy rasSed aJainst the
doorway. Then they were on sand, Ieet JratinJ in it. A ’thoSter winJ loomed
overhead, blottinJ the stars. The litter settled to the Jround.
   Paul’s eyes adMusted to the Iaint liJht. He recoJnized the deaI trooSer as
the man who oSened the ’thoSter door, Seered inside at the Jreen  Jloom
illuminated by the instrument Sanel.
   “This  the ’thoSter we’re suSSosed to use?” he asked, and turned to watch
his comSanion’s liSs.
   “It’s  the one the traitor said was Ii[ed Ior desert work,” the other said.
   ScarIace nodded. “But—it’s one oI them little  liaison Mobs. Ain’t room in
there Ior more’n them an’ two oI us.”
   “Two’s  enouJh,”  said the litter-bearer, movinJ  uS close and SresentinJ
his liSs Ior readinJ. “We can take care oI it Irom here on, Kinet.”
   “The   Baron he  told  me  to  make sure what  haSSened to them  two,”
ScarIace said.
   “What  you  so worried  about?”  asked another trooSer Irom behind  the
litter-bearer.
   “She is a Bene Gesserit witch,” the deaI one said. “They have Sowers.”

194
   “Ah-h-h….”   The litter-bearer made the siJn oI the Iist at his ear. “One oI
them, eh? Know whatcha mean.”
   The  trooSer behind him  Jrunted. “She’ll   be worm  meat soon  enouJh.
Don’t suSSose even a Bene Gesserit witch has Sowers over one oI them biJ
worms. Eh, CziJo?” He nudJed the litter-bearer.
   “Yee-uS,”  the litter-bearer said. He  returned to the  litter, took  Jessica’s
shoulders. “C’mon, Kinet. You can Jo alonJ iI you wants to make sure what
haSSens.”
   “It  is nice oI you to invite me, CziJo,”  ScarIace said.
   Jessica Ielt  herselI  liIted,  the  winJ  shadow  sSinninJ—stars. She was
Sushed into the rear oI the ’thoSter, her krimskell Iiber bindinJs e[amined,
and she was  straSSed down. Paul  was Mammed in beside her, straSSed
securely, and she noted his bonds were simSle roSe.
   ScarIace, the deaI  one they  called Kinet,  took  his Slace in  Iront.  The
litter-bearer, the one they  called CziJo,  came around and  took the  other
Iront seat.
   Kinet  closed his  door, bent  to the  controls. The ’thoSter  took oII  in  a
winJ-tucked surJe, headed south over  the Shield  Wall. CziJo  taSSed his
comSanion’s shoulder, said: “Whyn’t you  turn around and keeS an eye on
them two?”
   “Sure you know the way to Jo?” Kinet  watched CziJo’s liSs.
   “I  listened to the traitor same’s you.”
   Kinet  swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the Jlint oI starliJht  on a lasJun in
his hand. The ’thoSter’s liJht-walled interior seemed to collect illumination
as her eyes adMusted, but the Juard’s scarred Iace remained dim. Jessica
tested her seat belt, Iound it loose. She Ielt  rouJhness in the straS aJainst
her leIt arm,  realized the straS had been almost severed, would snaS at a
sudden Merk.
   Has  someone been at this ’thopter, preparing  it  for us?  she wondered.
Who? Slowly, she twisted her bound Ieet clear oI Paul’s.
   “Sure  do  seem a  shame to  waste a  Jood-lookinJ   woman like   this,”
ScarIace said. “You ever have any hiJhborn tySes?” He turned to look at the
Silot.
   “Bene Gesserit ain’t all hiJhborn,”  the Silot said.
   “But  they all looks heiJhty.”
   He can see me plain enough, Jessica thouJht. She brouJht her bound leJs
uS onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, starinJ at ScarIace.

195
   “Real Sretty, she is,” Kinet said. He wet his liSs with his tonJue. “Sure do
seem a shame.” He looked at CziJo.
   “You  thinkinJ what I think  you’re thinkinJ?”  the Silot asked.
   “Who’d   be to know?” the Juard asked. “AIterwards….”  He shruJJed. “I
Must never had me no hiJhborns. MiJht  never Jet  a chance like  this one
aJain.”
   “You  lay a hand on my mother….” Paul Jrated. He Jlared at ScarIace.
   “Hey!”   the Silot lauJhed. “Cub’s Jot a bark. Ain’t Jot no bite, thouJh.”
   And  Jessica thouJht: Paul’s  pitching  his voice  too high.  It  may work,
though.
   They Ilew  on in silence.
   These poor fools, Jessica thouJht, studyinJ her Juards and reviewinJ the
Baron’s words. They’ll  be  killed  as soon as they report  success on their
mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.
   The ’thoSter banked over the southern rim oI the Shield Wall, and Jessica
saw a moonshadowed e[Sanse oI sand beneath them.
   “This  ouJhta be Iar enouJh,”  the Silot said. “The traitor  said to Sut ’em
on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall.” He diSSed the craIt toward the
dunes in a lonJ, IallinJ stooS, brouJht it uS stiIIly over the desert surIace.
   Jessica saw  Paul  beJin  takinJ   the rhythmic   breaths oI   the  calminJ
e[ercise. He closed his  eyes, oSened them. Jessica stared, helSless to aid
him. He hasn’t mastered the Voice yet, she thouJht, if he fails….
   The  ’thoSter touched sand with a soIt  lurch, and Jessica, lookinJ  north
back across the Shield Wall, saw a shadow oI winJs settle out oI  siJht uS
there.
   Someone’s following us! she thouJht. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set
to watch this pair. And there’ll be watchers for the watchers, too.
   CziJo  shut oII his winJ rotors. Silence Ilooded in uSon them.
   Jessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond ScarIace a
dim Jlow  oI liJht  Irom a risinJ moon, a Irosted rim  oI rock risinJ  Irom the
desert. Sandblast ridJes streaked its sides.
   Paul cleared his throat.
   The Silot said: “Now, Kinet?”
   “I  dunno, CziJo.”
   CziJo  turned, said: “Ah-h-h, look.” He reached out Ior Jessica’s skirt.
   “Remove her JaJ,” Paul commanded.

196
   Jessica Ielt the words rollinJ  in the air. The tone, the timbre  e[cellent—
imSerative, very sharS. A sliJhtly lower Sitch would have been better, but it
could still Iall within  this man’s sSectrum.
   CziJo  shiIted his hand uS to the band around Jessica’s mouth, sliSSed the
knot on the JaJ.
   “StoS that!”  Kinet ordered.
   “Ah,  shut your  traS,” CziJo said. “Her  hands’re tied.” He Ireed the knot
and the bindinJ droSSed. His eyes Jlittered as he studied Jessica.
   Kinet  Sut a hand on the Silot’s arm. “Look, CziJo, no need to….”
   Jessica twisted her neck, sSat out the JaJ. She Sitched her voice in low,
intimate tones. “Gentlemen! No need to fight  over me.” At  the same time,
she writhed sinuously Ior Kinet’s beneIit.
   She  saw  them  Jrow   tense, knowinJ   that  in  this   instant  they  were
convinced oI  the need to  IiJht  over her.  Their disaJreement reTuired no
other reason. In their minds, they were IiJhtinJ over her.
   She held  her Iace hiJh  in  the instrument Jlow  to  be sure Kinet  would
read her  liSs,  said:  “You   mustn’t  disaJree.”  They  drew  Iarther   aSart,
Jlanced warily  at  each other. “Is  any  woman worth  IiJhtinJ   over?”  she
asked.
   By  utterinJ the words, by  beinJ there, she made herselI inIinitely worth
their IiJhtinJ.
   Paul  clamSed his liSs tiJhtly  closed, Iorced himselI  to  be silent. There
had been  the one  chance Ior   him  to  succeed with   the Voice.  Now—
everythinJ deSended on his mother whose e[Serience went so Iar beyond
his own.
   “Yeah,”  ScarIace said. “No need to IiJht over….”
   His  hand Ilashed toward the Silot’s neck. The blow was met by a sSlash
oI metal that cauJht the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet’s
chest.
   ScarIace Jroaned, saJJed backward aJainst his door.
   “ThouJht   I was  some dummy didn’t  know  that  trick,”  CziJo  said. He
brouJht  back  his   hand,  revealinJ  the   kniIe.   It  Jlittered   in   reIlected
moonliJht.
   “Now  Ior the cub,” he said and leaned toward Paul.
   “No  need Ior that,” Jessica murmured.
   CziJo  hesitated.

197
   “Wouldn’t   you  rather have me cooSerative?” Jessica asked. “Give  the
boy a chance.” Her liS curled  in a sneer. “Little  enouJh chance he’d have
out there in that sand. Give him  that and….” She smiled. “You  could Iind
yourselI well rewarded.”
   CziJo  Jlanced leIt, riJht, returned his attention to Jessica. “I’ve heard me
what can haSSen to a man in this desert,” he said. “Boy miJht Iind the kniIe
a kindness.”
   “Is  it so much I ask?” Jessica Sleaded.
   “You’re  tryinJ  to trick me,” CziJo muttered.
   “I  don’t want to see my son die,” Jessica said. “Is that a trick?”
   CziJo  moved back,  elbowed the door latch.  He Jrabbed Paul, draJJed
him across the seat, Sushed him halI out the door and held the kniIe Sosed.
“What’ll  y’  do, cub, iI I cut y’r bonds?”
   “He’ll   leave here immediately and head Ior those rocks,” Jessica said.
   “Is  that what y’ll  do, cub?” CziJo asked.
   Paul’s voice was SroSerly surly. “Yes.”
   The  kniIe  moved down, slashed the bindinJs  oI  his leJs. Paul  Ielt  the
hand on his back to hurl  him down  onto the sand, IeiJned a lurch aJainst
the doorIrame Ior Surchase, turned as thouJh to catch himselI, lashed out
with his riJht Ioot.
   The  toe was aimed with  a Srecision that did credit  to his lonJ  years oI
traininJ, as thouJh all oI that traininJ  Iocused on this instant. Almost every
muscle oI his body cooSerated in the Slacement oI it. The tiS struck the soIt
Sart oI  CziJo’s abdomen Must below the sternum, slammed uSward with
terrible Iorce  over the liver  and throuJh  the diaShraJm to crush the riJht
ventricle oI the man’s heart.
   With  one JurJlinJ   scream, the Juard Merked backward across the seats.
Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landinJ
with a roll  that took  uS the Iorce and brouJht him  back to his  Ieet in one
motion. He dove back into the cabin, Iound the kniIe and held it in his teeth
while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the blade and Ireed his hands.
   “I  could’ve  handled him,”  she said. “He’d have had to cut my bindinJs.
That was a Ioolish risk.”
   “I  saw the oSeninJ and used it,” he said.
   She  heard the harsh control  in  his  voice, said:  “Yueh’s  house siJn is
scrawled on the ceilinJ oI this cabin.”
   He looked uS, saw the curlinJ symbol.

198
   “Get  out and let us study this craIt,” she said. “There’s a bundle under the
Silot’s seat. I Ielt it when we Jot in.”
   “Bomb?”
   “Doubt  it. There’s somethinJ Seculiar here.”
   Paul  leaSed out to the sand and Jessica Iollowed.  She turned, reached
under the seat Ior the stranJe bundle, seeinJ CziJo’s Ieet close to her Iace,
IeelinJ damSness on the bundle as she removed it, realizinJ the damSness
was the Silot’s blood.
   Waste of moisture, she thouJht, knowinJ that this was Arrakeen thinkinJ.
   Paul stared around them, saw the rock scarS liItinJ out oI the desert like a
beach risinJ Irom the sea, wind-carved Salisades beyond. He turned back as
his mother  liIted  the bundle  Irom  the ‘thoSter,  saw her  stare across the
dunes toward the Shield Wall.  He looked to  see what drew her attention,
saw another ’thoSter swooSinJ toward them, realized they’d not have time
to clear the bodies out oI this ’thoSter and escaSe.
   “Run,  Paul!” Jessica shouted. “It’s Harkonnens!”

199
        Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife—chopping off what’s incomplete and saying: “Now,
        it’s complete because it’s ended here.”
                                            —from “Collected SayinJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
A  MAN   in  Harkonnen   uniIorm   skidded  to  a  stoS at  the  end oI   the hall,
stared in  at Yueh,  takinJ   in  at a  sinJle  Jlance  MaSes’  body,  the sSrawled
Iorm  oI  the Duke,  Yueh standinJ  there.  The man  held  a lasJun  in his  riJht
hand. There  was a  casual air  oI  brutality   about  him,  a  sense oI touJhness
and Soise that sent a shiver throuJh  Yueh.
    Sardaukar, Yueh  thouJht.  A  Bashar  by the  look  of him.  Probably   one of
the Emperor’s  own  sent here to  keep an  eye on things.  No  matter  what  the
uniform,  there’s no disguising  them.
    “You’re   Yueh,”  the man said.  He looked  sSeculatively  at  the Suk School
rinJ  on  the Doctor’s   hair,  stared once  at the  diamond  tattoo  and  then met
Yueh’s eyes.
    “I  am Yueh,”  the Doctor  said.
    “You   can rela[,    Yueh,”  the  man   said.  “When   you  droSSed  the  house
shields  we   came  riJht   in.   EverythinJ’s    under  control    here.  Is  this   the
Duke?”
    “This  is the Duke.”
    “Dead?”
    “Merely   unconscious. I  suJJest you tie  him.”
    “Did   you  do  Ior  these  others?”  He  Jlanced  back  down  the  hall   where
MaSes’ body  lay.
    “More’s  the Sity,”  Yueh muttered.
    “Pity!”    the Sardaukar  sneered. He  advanced, looked   down  at Leto.  “So
that’s the Jreat Red Duke.”
    If  I   had  doubts  about   what  this   man  is,  that   would  end  them,   Yueh
thought. Only  the Emperor  calls  the Atreides the Red Dukes.
    The  Sardaukar  reached  down,   cut  the  red  hawk   insiJnia   Irom   Leto’s
uniIorm.  “Little   souvenir,”  he said. “Where’s   the ducal siJnet  rinJ?”
    “He  doesn’t have it  on him,”  Yueh  said.
    “I  can see that!”  the Sardaukar snaSSed.

200
   Yueh stiIIened, swallowed. If they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they’ll
find out about the ring, about the ’thopter I prepared—all will fail.
   “Sometimes  the Duke sent the rinJ  with  a messenJer as surety that an
order came directly Irom him,” Yueh said.
   “Must  be damned trusted messenJers,” the Sardaukar muttered.
   “Aren’t  you JoinJ  to tie him?” Yueh ventured.
   “How  lonJ’ll  he be unconscious?”
   “Two  hours or  so. I  wasn’t as Srecise with his  dosaJe as I was Ior the
woman and boy.”
   The Sardaukar sSurned the Duke with his toe. “This was nothinJ to Iear
even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?”
   “About  ten minutes.”
   “So  soon?”
   “I  was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men.”
   “So  he will.  You’ll  wait  outside, Yueh.” He shot a hard Jlance at Yueh.
“Now!”
   Yueh Jlanced at Leto. “What about….”
   “He’ll   be delivered to the Baron  all SroSerly trussed like a roast Ior the
oven.”  AJain,  the  Sardaukar  looked  at  the  diamond  tattoo  on  Yueh’s
Iorehead. “You’re  known;  you’ll   be saIe enouJh in  the  halls. We’ve  no
more time Ior chit-chat, traitor. I hear the others cominJ.”
   Traitor,  Yueh thouJht. He lowered his Jaze, Sressed Sast the Sardaukar,
knowinJ this  as a Ioretaste oI how history would remember him:  Yueh the
traitor.
   He  Sassed more bodies on his way to the Iront entrance and Jlanced at
them, IearIul that one miJht be Paul or Jessica. All were house trooSers or
wore Harkonnen uniIorm.
   Harkonnen  Juards came alert, starinJ  at him  as  he emerJed Irom  the
Iront entrance into Ilame-liJhted niJht.  The Salms alonJ the road had been
Iired to  illuminate  the house. Black  smoke Irom  the Ilammables used to
iJnite the trees Soured uSward throuJh oranJe Ilames.
   “It’s  the traitor,” someone said.
   “The  Baron will want to see you soon,” another said.
   I  must get to the ’thopter, Yueh thouJht. I must put the ducal signet where
Paul will   find  it.  And   Iear struck  him:  If   Idaho suspects me or   grows
impatient-if he doesn’t wait  and go exactly where I  told him—Jessica and

201
Paul will  not  be saved from the carnage. I’ll   be denied even the smallest
relief from my act.
   The Harkonnen Juard released his arm, said “Wait over there out oI  the
way.”
   AbruStly,  Yueh saw  himselI as cast away  in  this Slace oI  destruction,
sSared nothinJ, Jiven not the smallest Sity. Idaho must not fail!
   Another Juard bumSed into him, barked: “Stay out oI the way, you!”
   Even  when they’ve profited  by me they  despise me. Yueh thouJht. He
straiJhtened himselI as he was Sushed aside, reJained some oI his diJnity.
   “Wait  Ior the Baron!” a Juard oIIicer snarled.
   Yueh nodded, walked  with  controlled casualness alonJ the Iront oI  the
house, turned the corner into shadows out  oI siJht  oI  the burninJ  Salms.
Quickly,  every steS betrayinJ  his  an[iety,  Yueh made  Ior  the rear  yard
beneath the conservatory where the  ’thoSter  waited—the craIt  they  had
Slaced there to carry away Paul and his mother.
   A  Juard stood at the oSen rear door oI the house, his attention Iocused on
the liJhted  hall  and men banJinJ  throuJh there, searchinJ Irom  room  to
room.
   How  conIident they were!
   Yueh huJJed  the shadows, worked his  way  around the ’thoSter, eased
oSen the door on the side away Irom the Juard. He Ielt under the Iront seats
Ior the Fremkit  he had hidden there, liIted  a IlaS and sliSSed in the ducal
siJnet. He Ielt the crinklinJ oI the sSice SaSer there, the note he had written,
Sressed the rinJ into the SaSer. He removed his hand, resealed the Sack.
   SoItly,  Yueh closed the ’thoSter door, worked his way back to the corner
oI the house and around toward the IlaminJ trees.
   Now, it is done, he thouJht.
   Once more, he emerJed into the liJht oI the blazinJ Salms. He Sulled his
cloak around him, stared at the Ilames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the
Baron and I will know. And the Baron—he will encounter a small tooth.

202
        There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the
        skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.
                                  —the Princess Irulan: “Introduction to a Child’s History of Muad’Dib”


 
  THE BARON   Vladimir   Harkonnen   stood  at  a viewSort   oI  the  Jrounded
liJhter  he  was  usinJ  as a  command  Sost. Out  the  Sort  he saw  the Ilame-
liJhted  niJht  oI  Arrakeen.  His  attention  Iocused  on the  distant  Shield  Wall
where his secret weaSon was doinJ  its work.
    E[Slosive  artillery.
    The  Juns   nibbled   at  the  caves   where  the   Duke’s   IiJhtinJ    men  had
retreated  Ior  a  last-ditch   stand.  Slowly    measured  bites  oI   oranJe  Jlare,
showers oI   rock  and  dust in  the  brieI   illumination—and    the  Duke’s   men
were  beinJ  sealed  oII   to  die  by  starvation,   cauJht  like   animals   in  their
burrows.
    The Baron  could  Ieel  the  distant  chomSinJ—a   drumbeat  carried  to him
throuJh the  shiS’s metal: broomp…  broomp.  Then: BROOMP-BROOMP!
    Who would  think  of  reviving  artillery   in  this day  of shields?  The thouJht
was a chuckle in  his mind.  But  it was predictable   the Duke’s men would  run
for   those   caves.  And   the   Emperor   will    appreciate    my   cleverness   in
preserving the lives  of our  mutual force.
    He adMusted one oI the little  susSensors that Juarded  his Iat  body aJainst
the Sull  oI   Jravity.  A   smile  creased his  mouth,   Sulled  at the  lines  oI  his
Mowls.
    A pity  to  waste  such fighting   men as the  Duke’s,  he thouJht.   He smiled
more broadly,  lauJhinJ  at himselI.  Pity  should  be cruel!  He nodded.  Failure
was, by  deIinition,   e[Sendable.   The whole   universe  sat there,  oSen to  the
man who  could  make  the  riJht  decisions.  The  uncertain  rabbits  had  to  be
e[Sosed, made  to  run Ior  their  burrows.   Else how  could  you  control   them
and breed them?  He  Sictured  his IiJhtinJ    men as bees routinJ   the  rabbits.
And he thouJht:  The day  hums sweetly when you have  enough bees working
for you.
    A door  oSened behind him.  The Baron  studied the  reIlection  in  the niJht-
blackened viewSort  beIore turninJ.

203
   Piter de Vries advanced into the chamber Iollowed by Umman Kudu, the
caStain oI the  Baron’s Sersonal Juard. There  was a motion  oI  men  Must
outside the door, the mutton Iaces oI his Juard, their e[Sressions careIully
sheeSlike in his Sresence.
   The Baron turned.
   Piter  touched IinJer   to  Iorelock  in  his  mockinJ  salute. “Good  news,
m’Lord. The Sardaukar have brouJht in the Duke.”
   “OI  course they have,” the Baron rumbled.
   He  studied the somber mask oI villainy  on Piter’s eIIeminate Iace. And
the eyes: those shaded slits oI bluest blue-in-blue.
   Soon I must remove him, the Baron thouJht. He has almost outlasted his
usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First,
though, he  must make the  people of  Arrakis  hate  him.  Then—they will
welcome my darling Feyd-Rautha as a savior.
   The  Baron  shiIted his  attention  to the  Juard caStain—Umman  Kudu:
scissors-line oI  Maw muscles, chin like a  boot toe—a  man to  be trusted
because the caStain’s vices were known.
   “First,  where is the traitor  who Jave me the Duke?” the Baron asked. “I
must Jive the traitor his reward.”
   Piter turned on one toe, motioned to the Juard outside.
   A  bit  oI  black movement there and Yueh walked throuJh.  His motions
were stiII  and strinJy. The mustache drooSed beside his SurSle liSs. Only
the old eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stoS three Saces into the room,
obeyinJ a motion Irom Piter, and stood there starinJ across the oSen sSace
at the Baron.
   “Ah-h-h,  Dr. Yueh.”
   “M’Lord   Harkonnen.”
   “You’ve  Jiven us the Duke, I hear.”
   “My  halI  oI the barJain, m’Lord.”
   The Baron looked at Piter.
   Piter nodded.
   The Baron looked back at Yueh. “The letter oI the barJain, eh? And I….”
He sSat the words out: “What was I to do in return?”
   “You  remember Tuite well, m’Lord Harkonnen.”
   And  Yueh  allowed  himselI  to think   now, hearinJ  the loud  silence oI
clocks in his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron’s manner.
Wanna was indeed dead—Jone Iar beyond their reach. Otherwise, there’d

still be a hold on the weak doctor. The Baron’s manner showed there was no
hold; it was ended.
   “Do  I?” the Baron asked.
   “You  Sromised to deliver my Wanna Irom her aJony.”
   The Baron  nodded. “Oh, yes. Now, I  remember. So I did. That  was my
Sromise. That was how we  bent the ImSerial ConditioninJ.   You couldn’t
endure seeinJ your Bene Gesserit witch Jrovel  in  Piter’s Sain amSliIiers.
Well, the Baron Vladimir  Harkonnen always keeSs his Sromises. I told you
I’d Iree her Irom the aJony and Sermit you to Moin her. So be it.” He waved
a hand at Piter.
   Piter’s  blue eyes took  a Jlazed  look. His  movement was catlike  in  its
sudden Iluidity. The kniIe in his hand Jlistened like a claw as it Ilashed into
Yueh’s back.
   The old man stiIIened, never takinJ his attention Irom the Baron.
   “So  Moin her!” the Baron sSat.
   Yueh  stood, swayinJ.  His  liSs  moved with  careIul  Srecision, and  his
voice came in  oddly measured cadence: “You …  think  …  you …  de …
Ieated … me. You …  think  … I  …  did …  not …  know …  what …  I  …
bouJht … Ior … my … Wanna.”
   He toSSled. No bendinJ or soIteninJ. It was like a tree IallinJ.
   “So  Moin her,” the Baron reSeated. But his words were like a weak echo.
   Yueh had Iilled him with  a sense oI IorebodinJ. He whiSSed his attention
to Piter, watched the man wiSe the blade on a scraS oI cloth, watched the
creamy look oI satisIaction in the blue eyes.
   So that’s how  he kills  by his  own hand, the Baron  thouJht. It’s  well to
know.
   “He  did Jive us the Duke?” the Baron asked.
   “OI  a certainty, my Lord,” Piter said.
   “Then  Jet him in here!”
   Piter Jlanced at the Juard caStain, who whirled to obey.
   The Baron looked down  at Yueh. From the way the man had Iallen, you
could susSect oak in him instead oI bones.
   “I  never could brinJ myselI to trust a traitor,” the Baron said. “Not even a
traitor I created.”
   He  Jlanced at the niJht-shrouded viewSort.  That black  baJ oI  stillness
out there was his, the Baron knew. There was no  more crumS oI artillery
aJainst the  Shield Wall  caves; the  burrow  traSs were  sealed oII.  Quite

205
suddenly, the Baron’s mind could conceive oI nothinJ  more beautiIul than
that utter  emStiness oI black. Unless  it  were white  on  the black.  Plated
white on the black. Porcelain white.
   But there was still the IeelinJ oI doubt.
   What  had  the old  Iool   oI  a doctor  meant? OI  course, he’d  Srobably
known what would  haSSen to him in  the end. But that bit  about thinkinJ
he’d been deIeated: “You think you defeated me.”
   What had he meant?
   The Duke Leto  Atreides came throuJh the door. His arms were bound in
chains, the  eaJle Iace  streaked with  dirt.   His  uniIorm  was  torn  where
someone had riSSed oII his insiJnia. There were tatters at his waist where
the shield belt had been removed without Iirst IreeinJ the uniIorm ties. The
Duke’s eyes held a Jlazed, insane look.
   “Wel-l-l-l,”    the Baron said. He  hesitated, drawinJ in a  deeS breath. He
knew he had  sSoken too loudly. This  moment, lonJ-envisioned,  had lost
some oI its savor.
   Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity!
   “I   believe  the Jood  Duke  is  druJJed,”  Piter  said. “That’s  how  Yueh
cauJht him Ior us.” Piter turned to the Duke. “Aren’t  you druJJed, my dear
Duke?”
   The voice was Iar away. Leto could Ieel the chains, the ache oI muscles,
his cracked liSs, his burninJ cheeks, the dry taste oI thirst whisSerinJ its Jrit
in his mouth.  But sounds were dull,  hidden by a cottony  blanket. And he
saw only dim shaSes throuJh the blanket.
   “What  oI  the woman and the boy, Piter?”  the Baron asked. “Any  word
yet?”
   Piter’s tonJue darted over his liSs.
   “You’ve  heard somethinJ!” the Baron snaSSed. “What?”
   Piter  Jlanced at  the Juard caStain, back to  the Baron.  “The  men who
were sent to do the Mob, my’Lord—they’ve … ah … been… ah …Iound.”
   “Well,  they reSort everythinJ satisIactory?”
   “They’re  dead, m’Lord.”
   “OI  course they are! What I want to know is—”
   “They  were dead when Iound, m’Lord.”
   The Baron’s Iace went livid. “And  the woman and boy?”
   “No  siJn,  m’Lord,  but there was a worm.  It  came while the scene was
beinJ investiJated. PerhaSs it’s as we wished—an accident. Possibly—”

206
   “We  do  not  deal in  Sossibilities, Piter.  What oI  the  missinJ ’thoSter?
Does that suJJest anythinJ to my Mentat?”
   “One  oI the Duke’s men obviously escaSed in it, m’Lord. Killed our Silot
and escaSed.”
   “Which  oI the Duke’s men?”
   “It   was a clean, silent killinJ,   m’Lord.  Hawat, SerhaSs, or that Halleck
one. Possibly Idaho. Or any toS lieutenant.”
   “Possibilities,”  the Baron  muttered. He Jlanced at the swayinJ, druJJed
IiJure oI the Duke.
   “The  situation is in hand, m’Lord,” Piter said.
   “No,   it  isn’t!   Where is  that  stuSid SlanetoloJist?  Where is  this  man
Kynes?”
   “We’ve  word where to Iind him and he’s been sent Ior, m’Lord.”
   “I   don’t  like  the way  the EmSeror’s servant is  helSinJ us,”  the Baron
muttered.
   They were words throuJh a cottony blanket, but some oI them burned in
Leto’s mind. Woman and boy—nosign. Paul and Jessica had escaSed. And
the Iate oI Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still
hoSe.
   “Where  is  the ducal siJnet  rinJ?”  the Baron  demanded. “His IinJer  is
bare.”
   “The  Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord,” the
Juard caStain said.
   “You  killed  the doctor too  soon,” the Baron said. “That  was a mistake.
You should’ve warned me, Piter. You moved too SreciSitately Ior the Jood
oI our enterSrise.” He scowled. “Possibilities!”
   The thouJht hunJ like  a sine wave in Leto’s mind: Paul and Jessica have
escaped! And there was somethinJ else in his memory: a barJain. He could
amost remember it.
   The tooth!
   He  remembered Sart oI it now: a  pill  of poison gas shaped into a false
tooth.
   Someone had  told  him  to remember  the tooth.  The  tooth was  in  his
mouth. He could Ieel its  shaSe with his tonJue. All  he had to do was bite
sharSly on it.
   Not yet!

207
   The someone had told him to wait until  he was near the Baron. Who had
told him? He couldn’t remember.
   “How  lonJ will  he remain druJJed like this?” the Baron asked.
   “PerhaSs another hour, m’Lord.”
   “PerhaSs,” the Baron muttered. AJain,  he turned to the niJht-blackened
window. “I am hunJry.”
   That’s the  Baron, that fuzzy gray  shape there, Leto thouJht. The  shaSe
danced back and Iorth, swayinJ with  the movement oI the room.  And the
room e[Sanded and contracted. It Jrew briJhter  and darker. It  Iolded into
blackness and Iaded.
   Time  became a seTuence oI layers Ior the Duke. He driIted uS throuJh
them. I must wait.
   There was a table. Leto saw the table Tuite clearly. And a Jross, Iat man
on the other side oI the table, the remains oI a meal in Iront oI him. Leto Ielt
himselI sittinJ in  a chair across Irom the Iat man, Ielt the chains, the straSs
that held his  tinJlinJ   body in  the chair.  He was aware there  had been a
SassaJe oI time, but its lenJth escaSed him.
   “I  believe he’s cominJ around, Baron.”
   A silky voice, that one. That was Piter.
   “So  I see, Piter.”
   A rumbling  basso: the Baron.
   Leto  sensed increasinJ deIinition in his surroundinJs. The chair beneath
him took on Iirmness, the bindinJs were sharSer.
   And  he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements oI the
man’s hands: comSulsive touchinJs—the edJe oI a Slate, the handle oI  a
sSoon, a IinJer tracinJ the Iold oI a Mowl.
   Leto watched the movinJ hand, Iascinated by it.
   “You  can hear me, Duke Leto,” the Baron said. “I know you can hear me.
We want to know Irom you where to Iind your concubine and the child you
sired on her.”
   No  siJn escaSed Leto, but the words were a wash oI  calmness throuJh
him. It’s true, then: they don’t have Paul and Jessica.
   “This   is not  a child’s  Jame  we Slay,”  the Baron  rumbled. “You  must
know that.” He  leaned toward Leto, studyinJ the Iace. It Sained the Baron
that this could not  be handled Srivately, Must between the two oI them. To
have others see royalty in such straits—it set a bad Srecedent.

208
   Leto  could  Ieel strenJth  returninJ. And  now,  the memory oI  the  Ialse
tooth stood out in  his  mind like  a steeSle in a Ilat  landscaSe. The nerve-
shaSed caSsule within that tooth—the Soison Jas—he remembered who had
Sut the deadly weaSon in his mouth.
   Yueh.
   DruJ-IoJJed  memory  oI seeinJ a limS  corSse draJJed Sast him in this
room hunJ like a vaSor in Leto’s mind. He knew it had been Yueh.
   “Do  you hear that noise, Duke Leto?” the Baron asked.
   Leto  Jrew conscious oI a IroJ  sound, the burred mewlinJ oI  someone’s
aJony.
   “We  cauJht one  oI your  men disJuised as a  Fremen,” the Baron  said.
“We Senetrated the disJuise Tuite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he
was sent amonJ the Fremen to sSy on them. I’ve  lived  Ior a time  on this
Slanet, cher cousin. One does not sSy on those raJJed scum oI the desert.
Tell me,  did you  buy  their helS? Did  you  send your woman  and son to
them?”
   Leto  Ielt Iear tiJhten his chest. If Yueh sent them to the desert fold … the
search won’t stop until they’re found.
   “Come,  come,” the  Baron said. “We don’t  have much time  and Sain is
Tuick. Please don’t brinJ it to this, my dear Duke.” The Baron looked uS at
Piter who stood at Leto’s shoulder. “Piter doesn’t have all his tools here, but
I’m sure he could imSrovise.”
   “ImSrovisation  is sometimes the best, Baron.”
   That silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.
   “You  had an emerJency Slan,” the Baron said. “Where have your woman
and the boy been sent?” He looked at Leto’s  hand. “Your rinJ  is missinJ.
Does the boy have it?”
   The Baron looked uS, stared into Leto’s eyes.
   “You  don’t  answer,” he said. “Will  you  Iorce me to do a thinJ  I  do not
want to do? Piter will use simSle, direct methods. I aJree they’re sometimes
the best, but it’s not Jood that you should be subMected to such thinJs.”
   “Hot  tallow  on the back, SerhaSs, or on the eyelids,” Piter said. “PerhaSs
on other  Sortions oI  the body. It’s   esSecially eIIective when  the subMect
doesn’t know where the tallow will Iall  ne[t.  It’s a Jood method and there’s
a sort  oI  beauty in  the  Sattern oI Sus-white  blisters on  naked skin,  eh,
Baron?”
   “E[Tuisite,”   the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.

209
   Those touching fingers! Leto watched the Iat hands, the JlitterinJ Mewels
on baby-Iat hands—their comSulsive wanderinJ.
   The sounds oI aJony cominJ throuJh the door behind him Jnawed at the
Duke’s nerves. Who is  it they  caught? he wondered. Could  it  have been
Idaho?
   “Believe  me, cher cousin,” the Baron  said. “I  do not want it  to come to
this.”
   “You  think  oI nerve couriers racinJ to summon helS that cannot come,”
Piter said. “There’s an artistry in this, you know.”
   “You’re  a suSerb artist,” the Baron Jrowled.  “Now, have the decency to
be silent.”
   Leto  suddenly recalled a thinJ  Gurney Halleck  had said once, seeinJ a
Sicture oI the Baron:  “‘And   I stood upon  the sand of  the sea and saw a
beast rise up out of the sea… and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. ’
”
   “We waste time, Baron,” Piter said.
   “PerhaSs.”
   The  Baron nodded. “You know,  my dear Leto, you’ll   tell  us in the end
where they are. There’s a level oI Sain that’ll buy you.”
   He’s most likely  correct, Leto thouJht. Were if not for the tooth… and the
fact that I truly don’t know where they are.
   The Baron Sicked uS a sliver oI meat, Sressed the morsel into his mouth,
chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thouJht.
   “Observe  this Srize  Serson who denies he’s Ior  hire,”  the  Baron said.
“Observe him, Piter.”
   And  the Baron  thouJht:  Yes! See him there, this man who  believes he
cannot be bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold
in dribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him,
he’d rattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What difference how he dies now?
   The IroJ sounds in the backJround stoSSed.
   The Baron saw Umman Kudu,  the Juard caStain, aSSear in the doorway
across the room, shake his head. The caStive hadn’t Sroduced the needed
inIormation. Another Iailure.  Time to Tuit stallinJ  with this Iool  Duke, this
stuSid soIt Iool who didn’t  realize how much hell there was so near him—
only a nerve’s thickness away.
   This  thouJht  calmed the  Baron, overcominJ  his  reluctance to  have a
royal  Serson subMect to Sain.  He  saw  himselI  suddenly  as a  surJeon

210
e[ercisinJ endless suSSle scissor dissections—cuttinJ away the masks Irom
Iools, e[SosinJ the hell beneath.
   Rabbits, all of them!
   And  how they cowered when they saw the carnivore!
   Leto  stared across the table, wonderinJ why he waited. The tooth would
end it  all  Tuickly.  Still—it   had been Jood,  much oI  this  liIe.  He  Iound
himselI rememberinJ an antenna kite  uSdanJlinJ in  the shell-blue sky  oI
Caladan, and Paul lauJhinJ with Moy at the siJht oI it. And he remembered
sunrise here on Arrakis—colored  strata oI  the  Shield Wall  mellowed  by
dust haze.
   “Too  bad,” the Baron muttered. He Sushed himselI back Irom the table,
stood uS liJhtly in his susSensors and hesitated, seeinJ a chanJe come over
the Duke. He saw the man  draw in  a deeS breath, the Mawline stiIIen, the
riSSle oI a muscle there as the Duke clamSed his mouth shut.
   How he fears me! the Baron thouJht.
   Shocked by Iear that the Baron miJht escaSe him, Leto bit sharSly on the
caSsule tooth, Ielt it break. He oSened his mouth, e[Selled the bitinJ vaSor
he could taste as it Iormed on his tonJue. The Baron Jrew smaller, a IiJure
seen in a tiJhteninJ  tunnel.  Leto heard a  JasS beside his ear—the silky-
voiced one: Piter.
   It  got him, too!
   “Piter!  What’s wronJ?”
   The rumblinJ  voice was Iar away.
   Leto  sensed memories rollinJ in his mind—the  old toothless mutterinJs
oI haJs. The room, the table, the Baron, a Sair oI terriIied eyes—blue within
blue, the eyes—all comSressed around him in ruined symmetry.
   There was a man with  a boot-toe chin,  a toy man IallinJ.   The toy man
had a broken nose slanted to the leIt: an oIIbeat metronome cauJht Iorever
at the  start oI  an  uSward stroke. Leto  heard the  crash oI  crockery—so
distant—a roarinJ in  his  ears. His mind  was a bin  without  end, catchinJ
everythinJ. EverythinJ   that had  ever  been: every shout,  every  whisSer,
every … silence.
   One thouJht  remained to him.  Leto saw it  in  Iormless liJht  on  rays oI
black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thouJht
struck him with a sense oI Iullness he knew he could never e[Slain.
   Silence.

211
   The Baron stood with his back aJainst his Srivate door, his own bolt hole
behind the table. He had slammed it on a room Iull oI dead men. His senses
took in  Juards swarminJ around him. Did  I  breathe it? he asked himselI.
Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?
   Sounds  returned to  him  …  and  reason. He  heard someone shoutinJ
orders—Jas masks … keeS a door closed … Jet blowers JoinJ.
   The others fell Tuickly, he thouJht. I’m  still  standing. I’m still  breathing.
Merciless hell! That was close!
   He  could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still
enouJh to slow molecular interchanJe across the Iield barrier. And he had
been SushinJ himselI away Irom the table … that and Piter’s shocked JasS
which had brouJht the Juard caStain dartinJ Iorward into his own doom.
   Chance and the warninJ in a dyinJ man’s JasS—these had saved him.
   The Baron Ielt  no Jratitude to Piter. The Iool had Jot himselI killed. And
that stuSid Juard caStain! He’d  said he  scoSed everyone beIore brinJinJ
them into the Baron’s Sresence! How had it been Sossible Ior the Duke … ?
No warninJ. Not even Irom the Soison snooSer over the table—until it was
too late. How?
   Well, no matter now, the Baron thouJht, his mind IirminJ. The next guard
captain will begin by finding answers to these Tuestions.
   He Jrew  aware oI more activity down the hall—around the corner at the
other door to that room oI death. The Baron Sushed himselI away Irom his
own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there starinJ, silent,
waitinJ Ior the Baron’s reaction.
   Would the Baron be angry?
   And  the Baron  realized only a Iew  seconds had Sassed since his IliJht
Irom that terrible room.
   Some  oI   the Juards  had  weaSons leveled  at  the  door.  Some  were
directinJ their Ierocity toward the emSty hall that stretched away toward the
noises around the corner to their riJht.
   A  man came stridinJ around that corner, Jas mask danJlinJ by its straSs
at his neck, his eyes intent on the overhead Soison snooSers that lined this
corridor. He  was yellow-haired,  Ilat  oI Iace  with  Jreen eyes. CrisS lines
radiated Irom his thick-liSSed mouth. He  looked like  some water creature
misSlaced amonJ those who walked the land.
   The  Baron stared at  the aSSroachinJ man, recallinJ  the name: NeIud.
Iakin NeIud. Guard corSoral. NeIud was addicted to semuta, the druJ-music

212
combination that Slayed itselI in  the deeSest consciousness. A useIul item
oI inIormation, that.
   The  man  stoSSed in  Iront   oI  the  Baron,  saluted.  “Corridor’s   clear,
m’Lord.  I   was outside  watchinJ  and  saw  that  it  must  be  Soison Jas.
Ventilators in  your  room  were  SullinJ  air  in  Irom  these corridors.”  He
Jlanced uS  at  the snooSer over  the  Baron’s  head. “None   oI  the  stuII
escaSed. We have the room cleaned out now. What are your orders?”
   The  Baron recoJnized the  man’s voice—the one  who’d  been shoutinJ
orders. Efficient, this corporal, he thouJht.
   “They’re  all dead in there?” the Baron asked.
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   Well, we must adjust, the Baron thouJht.
   “First,”   he said, “let me conJratulate you, NeIud. You’re the new caStain
oI my Juard. And  I hoSe you’ll  take to heart the lesson to be learned Irom
the Iate oI your Sredecessor.”
   The   Baron   watched  the  awareness  Jrow   in   his  newly   Sromoted
Juardsman. NeIud knew he’d never aJain be without his semuta.
   NeIud nodded. “My  Lord knows I’ll  devote myselI entirely to his saIety.”
   “Yes. Well,  to business. I susSect the Duke had somethinJ in his mouth.
You will  Iind  out what  that somethinJ was, how it  was used, who helSed
him Sut it there. You’ll take every Srecaution—”
   He  broke  oII,  his  chain oI  thouJht  shattered by  a  disturbance in  the
corridor behind him—Juards at the door to the liIt Irom  the lower levels oI
the IriJate tryinJ  to hold  back a tall  colonel bashar who had Must emerJed
Irom the liIt.
   The Baron couldn’t  Slace the colonel bashar’s Iace: thin with mouth like
a slash in leather, twin ink sSots Ior eyes.
   “Get  your hands oII me, you Sack oI carrion-eaters!” the man roared, and
he dashed the Juards aside.
   Ah-h-h, one of the Sardaukar, the Baron thouJht.
   The colonel  bashar came stridinJ toward the Baron, whose eyes went to
slits oI aSSrehension. The Sardaukar oIIicers Iilled him with  unease. They
all seemed to look like  relatives oI  the Duke  … the late  Duke. And  their
manners with the Baron!
   The  colonel bashar Slanted himselI  halI  a Sace in Iront  oI  the Baron,
hands on hiSs. The Juard hovered behind him in twitchinJ uncertainty.

213
   The  Baron noted the  absence oI salute, the disdain in  the Sardaukar’s
manner, and his unease Jrew. There was only the one leJion oI them locally
—ten briJades—reinIorcinJ the Harkonnen leJions,  but the Baron did  not
Iool  himselI.  That  one  leJion  was SerIectly  caSable oI  turninJ  on  the
Harkonnens and overcominJ them.
   “Tell  your  men they are not to Srevent me Irom seeinJ you, Baron,” the
Sardaukar Jrowled. “My men brouJht you the Atreides Duke beIore I could
discuss his Iate with you. We will discuss it now.”
   I  must not lose face before my men, the Baron thouJht.
   “So?”  It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron Ielt Sroud oI it.
   “My   EmSeror has  charJed me to  make  certain his  royal  cousin  dies
cleanly without aJony,” the colonel bashar said.
   “Such were the ImSerial orders to me,” the Baron lied. “Did you think I’d
disobey?”
   “I’m    to  reSort to  my  EmSeror  what  I  see with   my  own  eyes,”  the
Sardaukar said.
   “The  Duke’s already dead,” the Baron snaSSed, and he waved a hand to
dismiss the Iellow.
   The colonel bashar remained Slanted IacinJ the Baron. Not by Ilicker oI
eye or  muscle did  he  acknowledJe he had  been dismissed. “How?”   he
Jrowled.
   Really! the Baron thouJht. This is too much.
   “By  his own hand, iI you must know,” the Baron said. “He took Soison.”
   “I  will  see the body now,” the colonel Bashar said.
   The Baron raised his Jaze to the ceilinJ in IeiJned e[asSeration while his
thouJhts raced. Damnation! This sharp-eyed Sardaukar will  see the room
before a thing’s been changed!
   “Now,”  the Sardaukar Jrowled. “I’ll  see it with my own eyes.”
   There was no SreventinJ it, the Baron realized. The Sardaukar would see
all. He’d know the Duke had killed  Harkonnen men … that the Baron most
likely  had escaSed by a  narrow marJin.  There  was the evidence  oI  the
dinner remnants  on  the table,  and  the dead  Duke  across Irom  it   with
destruction around him.
   No SreventinJ it at all.
   “I’ll   not be Sut oII,” the colonel bashar snarled.
   “You’re   not  beinJ  Sut  oII,”   the  Baron  said,  and he  stared into   the
Sardaukar’s obsidian eyes. “I hide nothinJ Irom  my EmSeror.” He nodded

214
to NeIud. “The colonel bashar is to see everythinJ, at once. Take him in by
the door where you stood, NeIud.”
   “This  way, sir,” NeIud said.
   Slowly,  insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a
way throuJh the Juardsmen.
   Insufferable,  the  Baron thouJht.  Now,  the  Emperor will   know  how  I
slipped up. He’ll recognize it as a sign of weakness.
   And  it was aJonizinJ to realize that the EmSeror and his Sardaukar were
alike in  their  disdain Ior  weakness. The Baron  chewed at his  lower  liS,
consolinJ himselI that the EmSeror, at least, had not learned oI the Atreides
raid on Giedi Prime, the destruction oI the Harkonnen sSice stores there.
   Damn that slippery Duke!
   The Baron watched the retreatinJ backs—the arroJant Sardaukar and the
stocky, eIIicient NeIud.
   We must adjust,  the Baron  thought. I’ll   have to  put  Rabban over this
damnable planet  once  more.  Without  restraint.  I  must  spend  my own
Harkonnen blood to put Arrakis into a proper condition for accepting Feyd-
Rautha. Damn that Piter! He would get himself killed before I was through
with him.
   The Baron siJhed.
   And I  must send at once to Tleielax for a new Mentat. They undoubtedly
have the new one ready for me by now.
   One oI the Juardsmen beside him couJhed.
   The Baron turned toward the man. “I am hunJry.”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “And   I  wish  to  be diverted  while  you’re  clearinJ  out  that  room and
studyinJ its secrets Ior me,” the Baron rumbled.
   The Juardsman lowered his eyes. “What diversion does m’Lord wish?”
   “I’ll   be in my  sleeSinJ chambers,” the Baron said. “BrinJ me that younJ
Iellow we bouJht on Gamont, the one with the lovely eyes. DruJ him well.
I don’t Ieel like wrestlinJ.”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   The  Baron turned  away, beJan movinJ  with  his  bouncinJ,  susSensor-
buoyed Sace toward his chambers. Yes, he thouJht. The one with the lovely
eyes, the one who looks so much like the young Paul Atreides.

        O Seas of Caladan,
        O people of Duke Leto —
        Citadel of Leto fallen, 
        Fallen forever… 
                                                           —from“SonJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
P AUL  FELT   that  all   his  Sast,  every   e[Serience   beIore  this   niJht,   had
become sand  curlinJ  in  an  hourJlass.  He  sat near  his mother   huJJinJ   his
knees within    a small   Iabric   and Slastic   hutment—a  a  stilltent—that    had
come, like   the Fremen  clothinJ   they  now  wore,  Irom   the  Sack leIt  in  the
’thoSter.
    There was  no doubt  in  Paul’s  mind  who  had Sut the  Fremkit  there,  who
had directed the course oI  the ’thoSter  carryinJ  them caStive.
    Yueh.
    The traitor  doctor  had sent them directly  into  the hands oI Duncan  Idaho.
    Paul stared  out the  transSarent end oI  the  stilltent  at  the moonshadowed
rocks that rinJed  this Slace where  Idaho had hidden  them.
    Hiding   like  a  child  when  I’m   now  the Duke,  Paul  thouJht.   He  Ielt  the
thouJht Jall  him,  but could  not deny  the wisdom  in what  they did.
    SomethinJ   had  haSSened  to  his   awareness  this   niJht—he   saw   with
sharSened clarity  every  circumstance   and occurrence  around  him.   He Ielt
unable to stoS the inIlow   oI  data or the  cold Srecision  with  which  each new
item was  added to  his knowledJe   and the  comSutation  was centered  in his
awareness. It was Mentat  Sower and more.
    Paul thouJht  back to  the moment  oI imSotent  raJe as the stranJe  ‘thoSter
dived  out  oI  the  niJht   onto  them,  stooSinJ   like  a  Jiant   hawk  above  the
desert with  wind  screaminJ throuJh  its  winJs.  The thinJ  in  Paul’s mind  had
haSSened then. The  ’thoSter  had  skidded  and  slewed  across a  sand ridJe
toward the  runninJ  IiJures—his   mother and himselI.   Paul remembered how
the smell  oI burned  sulIur  Irom  abrasion  oI  ’thoSter  skids aJainst  sand had
driIted  across them.
    His mother,  he knew,  had turned,  e[Sected  to meet a lasJun  in  the hands
oI Harkonnen   mercenaries,  and had  recoJnized  Duncan  Idaho  leaninJ  out
the ’thoSter’s  oSen door shoutinJ:  “Hurry!   There’s  wormsiJn  south oI  you!”

216
   But   Paul  had   known  as  he   turned  who   Siloted  the  ’thoSter.  An
accumulation oI minutiae in the way it was Ilown, the dash oI the landinJ—
clues so  small  even  his  mother  hadn’t  detected  them—had  told  Paul
precisely who sat at those controls.
   Across  the stilltent  Irom Paul, Jessica stirred, said: “There  can be only
one  e[Slanation.   The  Harkonnens   held  Yueh’s   wiIe.   He   hated  the
Harkonnens! I cannot be wronJ about that. You read his note. But why has
he saved us Irom the carnaJe?”
   She is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thouJht. The thouJht was
a shock. He had known  this Iact as a by-the-way  thinJ  while readinJ  the
note that had accomSanied the ducal siJnet in the Sack.
   “Do   not  try  to  IorJive  me,”  Yueh  had written.   “I  do  not  want  your
IorJiveness. I already have enouJh burdens. What I  have done was done
without malice or hoSe oI another’s understandinJ. It is my own tahaddi al-
burhan, my ultimate test. I Jive you the Atreides ducal siJnet as token that I
write  truly.  By  the  time  you  read  this, Duke  Leto  will   be  dead. Take
consolation Irom my assurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate
above all others died with him.”
   It  had not  been addressed or siJned, but there’d been no mistakinJ the
Iamiliar scrawl—Yueh’s.
   RememberinJ the letter, Paul re-e[Serienced the distress oI that moment
—a thinJ sharS and stranJe that seemed to haSSen outside his new mental
alertness. He had read that  his Iather  was dead, known  the truth  oI  the
words, but had Ielt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his
mind and used.
   I  loved my father, Paul thouJht, and knew this Ior  truth. I should mourn
him. I should feel something.
   But he Ielt nothinJ  e[ceSt: Here’s an important fact.
   It  was one with all the other Iacts.
   All   the  while  his  mind  was  addinJ  sense imSressions, e[traSolatinJ,
comSutinJ.
   Halleck’s  words  came back to Paul:  “Mood’s  a thing  for  cattle  or  for
making love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood. ”
   Perhaps that’s it, Paul thought. I’ll  mourn my father later … when there’s
time.
   But  he Ielt no letuS in the cold Srecision oI his beinJ. He sensed that his
new awareness was only a beJinninJ,  that it  was  JrowinJ.  The sense oI

217
terrible  SurSose he’d Iirst  e[Serienced in   his ordeal  with  the  Reverend
Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam  Servaded him. His riJht  hand—the hand oI
remembered Sain—tinJled and throbbed.
   Is this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach? he wondered.
   “For   a while,   I  thouJht  Hawat had  Iailed  us aJain,”   Jessica said. “I
thouJht SerhaSs Yueh wasn’t a Suk doctor.”
   “He  was everythinJ  we  thouJht him  …  and more,” Paul  said. And  he
thouJht: Why is she so slow seeing these things? He said, “II Idaho doesn’t
Jet throuJh to Kynes, we’ll be—”
   “He’s  not our only hoSe,” she said.
   “Such was not my suJJestion,” he said.
   She heard the steel in his voice, the sense oI command, and stared across
the Jrey darkness oI the stilltent at him. Paul was a silhouette aJainst moon-
Irosted rocks seen throuJh the tent’s transSarent end.
   “Others amonJ your Iather’s men will  have escaSed,” she said. “We must
reJather them, Iind—”
   “We  will   deSend uSon ourselves,” he said. “Our immediate concern is
our Iamily  atomics. We must Jet  them beIore the Harkonnens can search
them out.”
   “Not  likely  they’ll  be Iound,” she said, “the way they were hidden.”
   “It  must not be leIt to chance.”
   And  she thouJht: Blackmail  with  the family  atomics as a  threat to  the
planet and its spice—that’s what he has in  mind. But  all  he can hope for
then is escape into renegade anonymity.
   His  mother’s  words had Srovoked another train  oI  thouJht in  Paul—a
duke’s concern Ior all the SeoSle they’d lost this niJht. PeoSle are the true
strenJth oI  a  Great House,  Paul thouJht.  And  he  remembered Hawat’s
words: “Parting  with people is a sadness; a place is only a place. ”
   “They’re    usinJ  Sardaukar,”  Jessica said.  “We   must  wait   until   the
Sardaukar have been withdrawn.”
   “They  think  us cauJht between the desert and the Sardaukar,” Paul said.
“They intend that  there be no Atreides survivors—total e[termination.  Do
not count on any oI our SeoSle escaSinJ.”
   “They  cannot Jo on indeIinitely riskinJ e[Sosure oI the EmSeror’s Sart in
this.”
   “Can’t  they?”
   “Some oI our SeoSle are bound to escaSe.”

218
   “Are  they?”
   Jessica turned away, IriJhtened oI the bitter  strenJth in her son’s voice,
hearinJ the Srecise assessment oI chances. She sensed that his mind had
leaSed ahead oI her, that it now saw more in  some resSects than she did.
She had helSed train the intelliJence  which  did  this,  but now  she Iound
herselI IearIul oI it.  Her thouJhts turned, seekinJ toward the lost sanctuary
oI her Duke, and tears burned her eyes.
   This is the way it had to be, Leto, she thouJht. “A time of love and a time
of grief. ”  She rested her hand on her abdomen, awareness Iocused on the
embryo there. I have the Atreides daughter I  was ordered to produce, but
the Reverend Mother was wrong: a daughter wouldn’t have saved my Leto.
This child   is only  life   reaching for   the future  in  the  midst  of  death. I
conceived out of instinct and not out of obedience.
   “Try  the communinet receiver aJain,” Paul said.
   The  mind goes on working  no  matter how  we try  to hold  it  back, she
thouJht.
   Jessica Iound the tiny receiver Idaho had leIt Ior them, IliSSed its switch.
A Jreen liJht Jlowed  on the instrument’s Iace. Tinny screechinJ came Irom
its sSeaker. She reduced the volume,  hunted across the  bands. A  voice
sSeakinJ Atreides battle lanJuaJe came into the tent.
   “…  back and reJrouS at the ridJe. Fedor reSorts no survivors in CarthaJ
and the Guild Bank has been sacked.”
   Carthag!  Jessica thouJht. That was a Harkonnen hotbed.
   “They’re    Sardaukar,” the  voice   said.  “Watch  out   Ior  Sardaukar  in
Atreides uniIorms. They’re….”
   A  roarinJ Iilled the sSeaker, then silence.
   “Try  the other bands,” Paul said.
   “Do  you realize what that means?” Jessica asked.
   “I  e[Sected it.  They want the Guild  to  blame us Ior destruction oI their
bank. With  the Guild  aJainst us, we’re traSSed on Arrakis.  Try the  other
bands.”
   She  weiJhed  his  words: I   expected it.  What  had  haSSened to him?
Slowly, Jessica returned to  the instrument. As  she moved  the bandslide,
they cauJht JlimSses oI violence in  the Iew voices callinJ  out in  Atreides
battle lanJuaJe: “… Iall back….”  “…  try to reJrouS at….” “…  traSSed in a
cave at….”

219
   And  there was no mistakinJ  the victorious  e[ultation  in the Harkonnen
Jibberish that Soured Irom the other bands. SharS commands, battle reSorts.
There wasn’t enouJh oI it Ior Jessica to reJister and break the lanJuaJe, but
the tone was obvious.
   Harkonnen victory.
   Paul shook the Sack beside him, hearinJ the two literMons oI water JurJle
there. He took a deeS breath, looked uS throuJh the transSarent end oI the
tent at the rock escarSment outlined aJainst the stars. His leIt hand Ielt the
sShincter-seal oI the tent’s entrance. “It’ll be dawn soon,” he said. “We can
wait throuJh the day Ior Idaho, but not throuJh another niJht. In the desert,
you must travel by niJht and rest in shade throuJh the day.”
   Remembered lore insinuated itselI into Jessica’s mind: Without a stillsuit,
a man sitting  in  shade on the  desert needs five liters  of  water a  day to
maintain body weight. She Ielt the slick-soIt skin oI the stillsuit  aJainst her
body, thinkinJ how their lives deSended on these Jarments.
   “II  we leave here, Idaho can’t Iind us,” she said.
   “There   are ways  to  make  any  man talk,”   he  said.  “II   Idaho  hasn’t
returned by dawn, we must consider the Sossibility  he has been caStured.
How lonJ do you think he could hold out?”
   The Tuestion reTuired no answer, and she sat in silence.
   Paul  liIted  the  seal on  the Sack, Sulled  out a  tiny  micromanual  with
Jlowtab and maJniIier. Green and oranJe letters leaSed uS at him Irom the
SaJes: “literMons, stilltent,  enerJy  caSs, recaths,  sandsnork, binoculars,
stillsuit  reSkit,  baradye Sistol,  sinkchart, Iilt-SluJs,   SaracomSass, maker
hooks, thumSers, Fremkit, Iire Sillar….”
   So many thinJs Ior survival on the desert.
   Presently, he Sut the manual aside on the tent Iloor.
   “Where can we Sossibly Jo?” Jessica asked.
   “My   Iather sSoke oI desert power,” Paul said. “The Harkonnens cannot
rule this Slanet without  it. They’ve  never ruled this  Slanet, nor shall they.
Not even with ten thousand leJions oI Sardaukar.”
   “Paul, you can’t think  that—”
   “We’ve  all the evidence in our hands,” he said. “RiJht here in this tent—
the tent itselI, this Sack and its contents, these stillsuits. We know the Guild
wants a Srohibitive Srice Ior weather satellites. We know that—”
   “What’ve   weather satellites to  do with  it?”   she asked. “They couldn’t
Sossibly….” She broke oII.

220
   Paul   sensed the  hySeralertness oI   his  mind   readinJ  her  reactions,
comSutinJ on minutiae.  “You  see it  now,”  he said. “Satellites  watch the
terrain below. There are thinJs in the deeS desert that will not bear IreTuent
insSection.”
   “You’re  suJJestinJ the Guild itselI controls this Slanet?”
   She was so slow.
   “No!”    he said.  “The  Fremen!  They’re  SayinJ  the Guild   Ior  Srivacy,
SayinJ in a coin that’s  Ireely available to anyone with  desert Sower-sSice.
This is  more  than  a second-aSSro[imation answer;  it’s  the straiJht-line
comSutation. DeSend on it.”
   “Paul,”  Jessica said, “you’re  not a Mentat yet;  you can’t know  Ior  sure
how—”
   “I’ll   never be a Mentat,” he said. “I’m somethinJ else … a Ireak.”
   “Paul!  How can you say such—”
   “Leave me alone!”
   He turned away Irom her, lookinJ  out into the niJht. Why can’t I mourn?
he wondered. He Ielt that every Iiber oI his beinJ craved this release, but it
would be denied him Iorever.
   Jessica had never heard such distress in her son’s voice. She wanted to
reach out to him,  hold him,  comIort him,  helS him—but she sensed there
was nothinJ she could do. He had to solve this Sroblem by himselI.
   The  JlowinJ  tab oI the  Fremkit manual between them on the tent Iloor
cauJht her eye. She liIted  it,  Jlanced at  the IlyleaI,  readinJ:  “Manual  oI
‘The Friendly Desert,’ the Slace Iull oI liIe.  Here are the ayat and burhan oI
LiIe. Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you.”
   It  reads like  the Azhar  Book, she thouJht,  recallinJ  her studies oI  the
Great Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?
   Paul liIted  the SaracomSass Irom the Sack, returned it, said: “Think oI all
these  sSecial-aSSlication   Fremen   machines.   They   show    unrivaled
soShistication. Admit it.  The culture that made these thinJs betrays deSths
no one susSected.”
   HesitatinJ, still  worried  by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to
the  book,  studied  an  illustrated  constellation  Irom   the  Arrakeen  sky:
“Muad’Dib:  The Mouse,” and noted that the tail Sointed north.
   Paul stared into the tent’s darkness at the dimly discerned movements oI
his mother revealed by the manual’s Jlowtab. Now is the time to carry  out
my father’s wish, he thouJht. I must give her his message now while she has

221
time for  grief. Grief  would  inconvenience us later. And he  Iound himselI
shocked by Srecise loJic.
   “Mother,”  he said.
   “Yes?”
   She heard the  chanJe in  his voice,  Ielt  coldness in her  entrails at  the
sound. Never had she heard such harsh control.
   “My  Iather is dead,” he said.
   She searched within herselI Ior  the couSlinJ oI  Iact and Iact and Iact—
the Bene Gesserit way oI assessinJ data—and it came to her: the sensation
oI terriIyinJ  loss.
   Jessica nodded, unable to sSeak.
   “My   Iather  charJed me  once,”  Paul said,  “to  Jive  you  a  messaJe iI
anythinJ haSSened to him. He Ieared you miJht believe he distrusted you.”
   That useless suspicion, she thouJht.
   “He   wanted  you  to  know  he  never  susSected you,”  Paul  said, and
e[Slained the deceStion, addinJ: “He wanted you to know he always trusted
you comSletely, always loved  you  and cherished you. He  said he would
sooner have mistrusted himselI and he had but one  reJret—that he never
made you his Duchess.”
   She brushed the tears coursinJ down her cheeks, thouJht: What a stupid
waste of the body’s water! But she knew this thouJht Ior  what it was—the
attemSt to retreat Irom JrieI  into  anJer. Leto, my Leto, she thouJht. What
terrible  things   we  do  to  those  we  love!  With   a  violent   motion,  she
e[tinJuished the little manual’s Jlowtab.
   Sobs shook her.
   Paul  heard his mother’s  JrieI  and Ielt  the  emStiness within himselI.  I
have no grief, he thought. Why? Why? He  Ielt the inability   to Jrieve  as a
terrible Ilaw.
   “A  time to get and time to lose, ” Jessica thouJht, TuotinJ to herselI Irom
the O.C. Bible. “A time to keep and a time to cast away; a time for love and
a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace. ”
   Paul’s  mind had Jone on  in  its chillinJ   Srecision. He saw the avenues
ahead oI them  on  this  hostile Slanet. Without  even  the saIety  valve  oI
dreaminJ, he Iocused his Srescient awareness, seeinJ it as a comSutation oI
most Srobable Iutures, but with  somethinJ more, an edJe oI  mystery—as
thouJh his mind diSSed into some timeless stratum and samSled the winds
oI the Iuture.

222
   AbruStly,  as thouJh he had Iound a necessary key, Paul’s mind climbed
another notch in  awareness. He Ielt   himselI  clinJinJ  to  this  new  level,
clutchinJ  at  a Srecarious hold  and SeerinJ  about. It   was as thouJh  he
e[isted within  a Jlobe with  avenues radiatinJ away in all directions …  yet
this only aSSro[imated the sensation.
   He  remembered once seeinJ a Jauze kerchieI blowinJ in  the wind  and
now  he sensed the  Iuture  as thouJh  it  twisted  across some surIace  as
undulant and imSermanent as that oI the windblown kerchieI.
   He saw SeoSle.
   He Ielt  the heat and cold oI uncounted Srobabilities.
   He  knew   names and  Slaces, e[Serienced emotions  without   number,
reviewed data oI innumerable une[Slored crannies. There was time to Srobe
and test and taste, but no time to shaSe.
   The  thinJ was a sSectrum oI Sossibilities Irom  the most remote Sast to
the most remote Iuture—Irom  the most Srobable to the most  imSrobable.
He saw his own death in countless ways. He saw new Slanets, new cultures.
   PeoSle.
   PeoSle.
   He  saw them  in  such swarms they  could  not  be listed,  yet  his mind
cataloJued them.
   Even the Guildsmen.
   And  he  thouJht:  The Guild-there’d   be a  way  for  us, my  strangeness
accepted as a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of
the now-necessary spice.
   But  the  idea oI  livinJ  out  his liIe   in  the mind-JroSinJ-ahead-throuJh-
Sossible-Iutures that Juided hurtlinJ sSaceshiSs aSSalled him. It was a way,
thouJh. And  in  meetinJ the possible future  that contained Guildsmen  he
recoJnized his own stranJeness.
   I  have another kind of sight. I  see another kind of terrain:  the available
paths.
   The awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm—so many Slaces on
that other kind oI terrain diSSed or turned out oI his siJht.
   As  swiItly  as it had come, the sensation sliSSed away Irom him, and he
realized the entire e[Serience had taken the sSace oI a heartbeat.
   Yet, his  own Sersonal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a
terriIyinJ way. He stared around him.

223
   NiJht   still  covered the stilltent  within   its rock-enclosed hideaway. His
mother’s JrieI could still be heard.
   His  own lack oI  JrieI could still  be Ielt  … that hollow  Slace somewhere
seSarated Irom his mind, which went  on in  its steady Sace—dealinJ with
data, evaluatinJ,  comSutinJ,  submittinJ  answers  in  somethinJ  like  the
Mentat way.
   And  now he saw that he had a wealth oI data Iew such minds ever beIore
had encomSassed. But this made the emSty Slace within him no easier to
bear. He Ielt  that somethinJ  must shatter. It  was as thouJh  a clockwork
control Ior a bomb had been set to tickinJ within  him.  It went on about its
business no matter  what he  wanted. It   recorded minuscule  shadinJs oI
diIIerence around him—a  sliJht   chanJe in  moisture, a  Iractional  Iall  in
temSerature, the SroJress oI an insect across their stilltent rooI, the solemn
aSSroach oI dawn in the starliJhted Satch oI sky he could see out the tent’s
transSarent end.
   The  emStiness was unbearable. KnowinJ how the clockwork  had been
set in motion made no diIIerence. He could look to his own Sast and see the
start oI it—the  traininJ, the  sharSeninJ oI talents, the reIined Sressures oI
soShisticated disciSlines, even e[Sosure  to  the  O.C. Bible   at  a critical
moment … and, lastly, the heavy intake oI sSice. And he could look ahead
—the most terriIyinJ direction—to see where it all Sointed.
   I’m  a monster! he thouJht. A freak!
   “No,”  he said. Then: “No. No! NO!”
   He  Iound   that  he was  SoundinJ  the  tent  Iloor  with   his  Iists.  (The
imSlacable Sart oI him recorded this as an interestinJ emotional datum and
Ied it into comSutation.)
   “Paul!”
   His  mother  was beside him,  holdinJ   his hands, her  Iace a  Jray  blob
SeerinJ at him. “Paul, what’s wronJ?”
   “You!”  he said.
   “I’m   here, Paul,” she said. “It’s all riJht.”
   “What  have you done to me?” he demanded.
   In  a burst oI clarity, she sensed some oI the roots in the Tuestion, said: “I
Jave birth to you.”
   It  was, Irom instinct as much as her own subtle knowledJe, the Srecisely
correct answer to calm him. He Ielt her hands holdinJ him, Iocused on the
dim outline  oI  her Iace. (Certain  Jene traces in her  Iacial structure were

224
noted in the new way by his onIlowinJ mind, the clues added to other data,
and a Iinal-summation answer Sut Iorward.)
   “Let  Jo oI me,” he said.
   She heard the iron in his voice,  obeyed. “Do you want to  tell me what’s
wronJ, Paul?”
   “Did  you know what you were doinJ when you trained me?” he asked.
   There’s no more  childhood in  his voice,  she thouJht. And  she said: “I
hoSed the thinJ any Sarent hoSes—that you’d be … suSerior, diIIerent.”
   “DiIIerent?”
   She heard the bitterness in his tone, said: “Paul, I—”
   “You  didn’t want a son!” he said. “You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach! You
wanted a male Bene Gesserit!”
   She recoiled Irom his bitterness. “But Paul….”
   “Did  you ever consult my Iather in this?”
   She sSoke Jently out  oI the  Ireshness oI her JrieI:  “Whatever you  are,
Paul, the heredity is as much your Iather as me.”
   “But  not  the traininJ,”  he said. “Not  the thinJs that…  awakened … the
sleeSer.”
   “SleeSer?”
   “It’s   here.” He Sut a hand to his head and then to his  breast. “In me. It
Joes on and on and on and or. and—”
   “Paul!”
   She had heard the hysteria edJinJ his voice.
   “Listen  to me,” he said. “You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about
my dreams: You listen in her Slace now. I’ve Must had a wakinJ dream. Do
you know why?”
   “You  must calm yourselI,” she said. “II there’s—”
   “The  sSice,” he said. “It’s in  everythinJ here—the air, the soil, the Iood,
the geriatric sSice. It’s like the Truthsayer druJ. It’s a Soison!”
   She stiIIened.
   His voice lowered and he reSeated: “A Soison—so subtle, so insidious …
so irreversible. It  won’t  even kill  you  unless you stoS takinJ it.  We can’t
leave Arrakis unless we take Sart oI Arrakis with us.”
   The terriIyinJ  presence oI his voice brooked no disSute.
   “You  and the sSice,” Paul said. “The sSice chanJes anyone who Jets this
much oI it,  but thanks to you, I could brinJ  the chanJe to consciousness. I

225
don’t Jet to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked
out. I can see it.”
   “Paul, you—”
   “I  see it!” he reSeated.
   She heard madness in his voice, didn’t know what to do.
   But  he sSoke aJain, and she heard the iron control return to him: “We’re
traSSed here.”
   We’re trapped here, she aJreed.
   And   she acceSted the truth   oI  his  words.  No  Sressure oI  the  Bene
Gesserit, no  trickery   or  artiIice  could  Sry  them  comSletely  Iree  Irom
Arrakis: the sSice was addictive. Her body had known the Iact lonJ beIore
her mind awakened to it.
   So here we live out our  lives, she thouJht, on this hell-planet. The place
is prepared for us, if we can evade the Harkonnens. And there’s no doubt of
my course: a  broodmare preserving an important  bloodline  for  the Bene
Gesserit Plan.
   “I  must tell you about my wakinJ dream,” Paul said. (Now there was Iury
in his voice.)  “To be sure you  acceSt what I say, I’ll  tell  you Iirst  I  know
you’ll bear a dauJhter, my sister, here on Arrakis.”
   Jessica Slaced her hands aJainst the tent Iloor, Sressed back aJainst the
curvinJ Iabric wall to still  a SanJ oI Iear. She knew her SreJnancy could not
show yet. Only her own Bene Gesserit traininJ had allowed her to read the
Iirst Iaint siJnals oI her body, to know oI the embryo only a Iew weeks old.
   “Only  to  serve,” Jessica whisSered, clinJinJ to the Bene Gesserit motto.
“We e[ist only to serve.”
   “We’ll    Iind   a  home  amonJ   the  Fremen,”  Paul  said,  “where   your
Missionaria Protectiva has bouJht us a bolt hole.”
   They’veprepared a way jor us in the desert, Jessica told herselI. But how
can he  know  of  the Missionaria   Protectiva?  She Iound  it   increasinJly
diIIicult  to subdue her terror at the overSowerinJ stranJeness in Paul.
   He  studied the dark  shadow oI her, seeinJ her  Iear and every reaction
with his  new awareness as thouJh she were outlined in  blindinJ  liJht.  A
beJinninJ oI comSassion Ior her creSt over him.
   “The  thinJs that can haSSen here, I cannot beJin to tell you,” he said. “I
cannot even beJin to tell myselI, althouJh I’ve seen them. This sense oI the
Iuture—I  seem to have  no control  over  it.  The thinJ   Must haSSens. The
immediate Iuture—say, a year—I can see some oI that… a road as broad as

226
our Central  Avenue on  Caladan. Some Slaces I  don’t  see …  shadowed
Slaces… as thouJh it  went  behind a  hill”   (and aJain  he thouJht  oI  the
surIace oI a blowinJ kerchieI) and there are branchinJs….”
   He Iell  silent as memory oI that seeing Iilled him. No Srescient dream, no
e[Serience oI his liIe had Tuite SreSared him Ior the totality with which the
veils had been riSSed away to reveal naked time.
   RecallinJ  the e[Serience, he recoJnized his own  terrible  SurSose —the
Sressure oI his liIe  sSreadinJ outward like  an e[SandinJ  bubble …  time
retreatinJ beIore it….
   Jessica Iound the tent’s Jlowtab control, activated it.
   Dim  Jreen liJht  drove back the shadows, easinJ her Iear. She looked at
Paul’s Iace, his eyes—the inward stare. And she knew where she had seen
such a  look   beIore: Sictured  in  records  oI  disasters—on  the Iaces  oI
children who e[Serienced starvation or  terrible inMury. The eyes were like
Sits, mouth a straiJht line, cheeks indrawn.
   It’s  the look of terrible  awareness, she thouJht, of someone forced to the
knowledge of his own mortality.
   He was, indeed, no lonJer a child.
   The  underlyinJ  imSort  oI  his words  beJan to  take over  in  her mind,
SushinJ all else aside. Paul could see ahead, a way oI escaSe Ior them.
   “There’s a way to evade the Harkonnens,” she said.
   “The  Harkonnens!”  he sneered. “Put those twisted humans out oI  your
mind.” He stared at his mother, studyinJ the lines oI her Iace in the liJht oI
the Jlowtab. The lines betrayed her.
   She said: “You shouldn’t reIer to SeoSle as humans without—”
   “Don’t   be so sure you know where to draw the line,” he said. “We carry
our Sast with us.  And, mother  mine, there’s a thinJ  you  don’t know  and
should—we are Harkonnens.”
   Her mind  did a terriIyinJ thinJ:  it blanked out as thouJh it needed to shut
oII all sensation. But Paul’s voice went on at that imSlacable Sace, draJJinJ
her with it.
   “When  ne[t  you  Iind  a mirror,  study your  Iace—study mine now.  The
traces are there iI you don’t blind yourselI. Look at my hands, the set oI my
bones. And iI  none oI this  convinces you, then take my  word  Ior it.  I’ve
walked the Iuture, I’ve  looked at a record, I’ve  seen a Slace, I have all the
data. We’re Harkonnens.”

227
   “A  …  reneJade branch oI the Iamily,” she said. “That’s it, isn’t it? Some
Harkonnen cousin who—”
   “You’re   the Baron’s own  dauJhter,” he said, and watched the  way she
Sressed her hands to her mouth. “The Baron samSled many Sleasures in his
youth, and once Sermitted himselI to be seduced. But it was Ior the Jenetic
SurSoses oI the Bene Gesserit, by one oI you.”
   The way he said you struck her like a slaS. But it set her mind to workinJ
and she could not deny his words. So many blank ends oI meaninJ in  her
Sast reached out now and linked. The dauJhter the Bene Gesserit wanted—
it wasn’t  to end the old Atreides-Harkonnen Ieud, but  to Ii[   some Jenetic
Iactor in their lines. What? She JroSed Ior an answer.
   As  thouJh he saw inside her mind,  Paul said: “They  thouJht they were
reachinJ Ior me. But  I’m  not what  they e[Sected, and I’ve  arrived beIore
my time. And they don’t know it.”
   Jessica Sressed her hands to her mouth.
   Great Mother!  He’s the Kwisatz Haderach!
   She Ielt  e[Sosed and naked beIore him,  realizinJ  then that he saw her
with eyes Irom  which little  could  be hidden. And that,  she knew, was the
basis oI her Iear.
   “You’re   thinkinJ  I’m  the Kwisatz  Haderach,” he said. “Put  that  out oI
your mind. I’m somethinJ une[Sected.”
   I  must get word out to one of the schools, she thouJht. The mating index
may show what has happened.
   “They  won’t learn about me until it’s too late,” he said.
   She souJht to divert him, lowered her hands and said: “We’ll Iind a Slace
amonJ the Fremen?”
   “The   Fremen  have  a  sayinJ  they  credit  to   Shai-hulud,  Old  Father
Eternity,” he said. “They say: ‘Be SreSared to aSSreciate what you meet.’ ”
   And  he thouJht: Yes, mother mine-among the Fremen. You’ll acTuire the
blue eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter  tube to your
stillsuit… and you’ll bear my sister: St. Alia of the Knife.
   “II  you’re  not the Kwisatz Haderach,” Jessica said, “what—”
   “You  couldn’t  Sossibly know,”  he said. “You won’t  believe it  until  you
see it.”
   And  he thouJht: I’m a seed.
   He  suddenly saw how Iertile  was the Jround  into which  he had Iallen,
and with this  realization, the terrible  SurSose Iilled him, creeSinJ throuJh

228
the emSty Slace within, threateninJ to choke him with JrieI.
   He  had  seen two  main  branchinJs alonJ  the  way  ahead—in one  he
conIronted an evil old Baron and said: “Hello, GrandIather.” The thouJht oI
that Sath and what lay alonJ it sickened him.
   The  other Sath held lonJ Satches oI Jrey obscurity  e[ceSt Ior  Seaks oI
violence. He had seen a warrior reliJion  there, a Iire  sSreadinJ across the
universe with the  Atreides Jreen and black banner wavinJ  at the head oI
Ianatic leJions drunk on  sSice liTuor. Gurney Halleck and a Iew others oI
his Iather’s men—a SitiIul Iew—were amonJ them, all marked by the hawk
symbol Irom the shrine oI his Iather’s skull.
   “I  can’t  Jo that way,” he muttered. “That’s what  the old witches oI your
schools really want.”
   “I  don’t understand you, Paul,” his mother said.
   He remained silent, thinkinJ  like the seed he was, thinkinJ with  the race
consciousness he had Iirst e[Serienced as terrible SurSose. He Iound that he
no  lonJer  could  hate  the  Bene  Gesserit or  the  EmSeror  or  even  the
Harkonnens. They were all cauJht uS in the need oI their race to renew its
scattered inheritance, to cross and minJle and inIuse their bloodlines  in a
Jreat new SoolinJ oI Jenes. And the race knew only one sure way Ior this—
the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everythinJ in its
Sath: Mihad.
   Surely, I cannot choose that way, he thouJht.
   But  he saw aJain in his mind’s eye the shrine oI his Iather’s skull and the
violence with the Jreen and black banner wavinJ in its midst.
   Jessica cleared her throat, worried by his  silence. “Then …  the Fremen
will Jive  us sanctuary?”
   He looked uS, starinJ across the Jreen-liJhted tent at the inbred, Satrician
lines oI her Iace. “Yes,” he said. “That’s one oI the ways.” He nodded. “Yes.
They’ll call  me … Muad‘Dib, ‘The  One Who Points the Way.’ Yes … that’s
what they’ll call me.”
   And  he closed his eyes, thinkinJ: Now, my jather, I can mourn you. And
he Ielt the tears coursinJ down his cheeks.

Book Two


MUAD‘DIB

230
         When my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto’s death and the manner of it, he
         went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my mother and the compact
         forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed the Guild and the evil old
         Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all
         the others. And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to anolder law of
         self- preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and
         asked if I thought him aweakling. I saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by
         concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it,
         I think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and
         Muad’Dib’s shared common ancestry.
                                                                         —“In  My Father’s House,” by the Princess Irulan



 
  “Now  HARKONNEN         shall   kill    Harkonnen,”       Paul  whisSered.
    He    had   awakened     shortly     beIore    niJhtIall,       sittinJ     uS  in    the   sealed   and
darkened    stilltent.      As  he   sSoke,   he  heard    the  vaJue    stirrinJs     oI   his   mother
where   she  sleSt  aJainst    the  tent’s    oSSosite   wall.
    Paul    Jlanced     at  the    Sro[imity       detector     on   the   Iloor,    studyinJ      the   dials
illuminated      in  the  blackness     by  ShosShor    tubes.
    “It    should    be   niJht    soon,”    his   mother    said.    “Why     don’t    you   liIt    the   tent
shades?”
    Paul    realized     then   that   her   breathinJ      had   been   diIIerent      Ior   some    time,
that  she  had  lain   silent    in  the  darkness    until    certain   he  was   awake.
    “LiItinJ       the   shades   wouldn’t      helS,”    he   said.   “There’s     been   a  storm.    The
tent’s   covered    by  sand.   I’ll   diJ   us  out   soon.”
    “No    siJn   oI  Duncan    yet?”
    “None.”
    Paul   rubbed    absently    at  the   ducal   siJnet    on  his   thumb,    and  a  sudden   raJe
aJainst   the   very   substance    oI  this   Slanet   which    had   helSed   kill    his  Iather    set
him   tremblinJ.
    “I   heard   the  storm    beJin,”    Jessica   said.
    The    undemandinJ       emStiness     oI    her   words    helSed    restore     some    oI   his
calm.   His    mind    Iocused    on   the   storm    as  he  had   seen   it   beJin    throuJh     the
transSarent    end   oI   their    stilltent—cold        dribbles     oI   sand   crossinJ    the   basin,
then  runnels     and  tails    IurrowinJ      the   sky.   He  had   looked    uS  to   a rock    sSire,
seen   it   chanJe    shaSe    under    the   blast,    becominJ       a  low,    Cheddar-colored

231
wedJe. Sand Iunneled  into  their  basin had shadowed the  sky  with  dull
curry, then blotted out all liJht as the tent was covered.
   Tent bows had creaked once as they acceSted the Sressure, then—silence
broken only by the dim bellows wheezinJ oI their sand snorkel SumSinJ air
Irom the surIace.
   “Try  the receiver aJain,” Jessica said.
   “No  use,” he said.
   He  Iound his  stillsuit’s  watertube in  its cliS  at his  neck, drew a  warm
swallow  into  his  mouth,  and  he  thouJht  that  here  he  truly  beJan  an
Arrakeen e[istence—livinJ  on reclaimed moisture Irom his own breath and
body. It was Ilat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.
   Jessica heard Paul drinkinJ, Ielt the slickness oI her own stillsuit clinJinJ
to her body, but she reIused to acceSt her thirst. To acceSt it would reTuire
awakeninJ Iully  into  the  terrible  necessities oI Arrakis  where they  must
Juard even Iractional  traces oI  moisture,  hoardinJ the  Iew  droSs in  the
tent’s catchSockets, beJrudJinJ a breath wasted on the oSen air.
   So much easier to driIt back down into sleeS.
   But  there  had been a  dream in  this  day’s  sleeS, and she shivered at
memory oI  it.  She had  held dreaminJ  hands beneath sandIlow where  a
name had been written: Duke Leto Atreides. The name had blurred with the
sand and she had moved to restore it, but the Iirst letter Iilled beIore the last
was beJun.
   The sand would not stoS.
   Her dream became wailinJ: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailinJ—
Sart oI her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child,
little  more than a baby. A woman  not Tuite visible  to memory was JoinJ
away.
   My  unknown mother, Jessica thouJht. The Bene Gesserit who bore  me
and gave me to the Sisters because that’s what she was commanded to do.
Was she glad to rid herself of a Harkonnen child?
   “The  Slace to hit them is in the sSice,” Paul said.
   How can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herselI.
   “An  entire Slanet Iull oI sSice,” she said. “How can you hit them there?”
   She heard him stirrinJ,  the sound oI their Sack beinJ draJJed across the
tent Iloor.
   “It  was sea Sower and air Sower on Caladan,” he said. “Here, it’s desert
power. The Fremen are the key.”

232
   His   voice  came Irom   the vicinity   oI   the  tent’s sShincter. Her  Bene
Gesserit traininJ sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.
   All  his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens, she thouJht. Now, he
finds he is Harkonnen … because of me. How little he knows me! I was my
Duke’s only woman. I accepted his life  and his values even to defying my
Bene Gesserit orders.
   The tent’s Jlowtab  came aliJht under Paul’s hand, Iilled the domed area
with  Jreen  radiance. Paul  crouched at  the  sShincter, his  stillsuit   hood
adMusted Ior the oSen desert—Iorehead caSSed, mouth Iilter in Slace, nose
SluJs adMusted. Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band oI Iace that
turned once toward her and away.
   “Secure yourselI Ior the oSen,” he said, and his voice was blurred behind
the Iilter.
   Jessica Sulled the Iilter across her mouth, beJan adMustinJ her hood as she
watched Paul break the tent seal.
   Sand rasSed as he oSened the sShincter and a burred Iizzle oI Jrains ran
into the tent beIore he could immobilize it  with a static comSaction tool. A
hole Jrew in  the sandwall as the tool realiJned  the Jrains. He sliSSed out
and her ears Iollowed his SroJress to the surIace.
   What  will  we find  out there? she wondered. Harkonnen troops and the
Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we
don’t know?
   She thouJht oI  the comSaction tool and the other stranJe instruments in
the Sack. Each oI  these tools  suddenly  stood in  her mind  as  a siJn  oI
mysterious danJers.
   She Ielt then a hot breeze Irom surIace sand touch her cheeks where they
were e[Sosed above the Iilter.
   “Pass uS the Sack.” It was Paul’s voice, low and Juarded.
   She moved to  obey, heard the water literMons JurJle as she shoved the
Sack across the Iloor. She Seered uSward, saw Paul Iramed aJainst stars.
   “Here,”  he said and reached down, Sulled the Sack to the surIace.
   Now  she saw only the circle oI stars. They were like the luminous tiSs oI
weaSons aimed down at her. A   shower oI  meteors crossed her Satch oI
niJht. The  meteors seemed to her like  a  warninJ,  like  tiJer  striSes, like
luminous Jrave slats clabberinJ her blood. And she Ielt the chill oI the Srice
on their heads.
   “Hurry  uS,” Paul said. “I want to collaSse the tent.”

233
   A  shower oI sand Irom the surIace brushed her leIt hand. How much sand
will the hand hold? she asked herselI.
   “Shall  I helS you?” Paul asked.
   “No.”
   She swallowed  in a  dry throat,  sliSSed into the hole, Ielt  static-Sacked
sand rasS under her hands. Paul reached down, took her  arm. She stood
beside him on a smooth Satch oI starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost
brimmed their   basin, leavinJ  only  a  dim  liS  oI   surroundinJ  rock.  She
Srobed the Iarther darkness with her trained senses.
   Noise oI small animals.
   Birds.
   A  Iall oI dislodJed sand and Iaint creature sounds within it.
   Paul collaSsinJ their tent, recoverinJ it uS the hole.
   StarliJht  disSlaced Must enouJh oI the niJht to charJe each shadow with
menace. She looked at Satches oI blackness.
   Black  is a  blind remembering, she thouJht. You listen for  pack sounds,
for the cries of  those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only
your most primitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.
   Presently, Paul stood beside her, said: “Duncan  told  me that iI  he  was
caStured, he could hold  out…  this  lonJ.  We must  leave here now.”  He
shouldered the Sack, crossed to the shallow liS oI the basin, climbed  to a
ledJe that looked down on oSen desert.
   Jessica Iollowed  automatically, notinJ  how she now  lived  in  her son’s
orbit.
   For  now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thouJht. This
world has emptied me of all  but the oldest purpose: tomorrow’s life. I  live
now for my young Duke and the daughter yet to be.
   She Ielt the sand draJ her Ieet as she climbed to Paul’s side.
   He looked north across a line oI rocks, studyinJ a distant escarSment.
   The  Iaraway  rock  SroIile  was  like  an  ancient  battleshiS oI  the  seas
outlined by  stars. The lonJ  swish  oI  it  liIted  on  an invisible  wave  with
syllables  oI   boomeranJ  antennae,  Iunnels  arcinJ   back,   a  Si-shaSed
uSthrustinJ at the stern.
   An  oranJe Jlare burst above the silhouette and a line oI  brilliant  SurSle
cut downward toward the Jlare.
   Another line oI  SurSle!
   And  another uSthrustinJ oranJe Jlare!

234
   It  was like  an ancient naval  battle, remembered shellIire, and the siJht
held them starinJ.
   “Pillars  oI Iire,”  Paul whisSered.
   A  rinJ  oI red eyes liIted over the distant rock.  Lines oI SurSle laced the
sky.
   “JetIlares and lasJuns,” Jessica said.
   The dust-reddened Iirst moon oI Arrakis liIted  above the horizon to their
leIt and they saw a storm trail there—a ribbon oI movement over the desert.
   “It  must be Harkonnen ’thoSters huntinJ us,” Paul said. “The way they’re
cuttinJ  uS  the desert…  it’s   as thouJh  they  were  makinJ  certain  they
stamSed out whatever’s there… the way you’d stamS out a nest oI insects.”
   “Or  a nest oI Atreides,” Jessica said.
   “We  must  seek cover,”  Paul said. “We’ll   head south  and keeS to  the
rocks. II they cauJht us in the oSen….” He turned, adMustinJ the Sack to his
shoulders. “They’re killinJ anythinJ  that moves.”
   He took  one steS alonJ the ledJe and, in that instant, heard the low hiss
oI JlidinJ  aircraIt, saw the dark shaSes oI ornithoSters above them.

235
        My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all
        morality. “Something cannot emerge from nothing,” he said. This is profound thinking if you
        understand how unstable “the truth”can be.

  “I’VE  ALWAYS   Srided  myselI  on  seeinJ  thinJs  the  way  they  truly   are,”
ThuIir   Hawat  said.  “That’s   the  curse  oI  beinJ   a  Mentat.  You  can’t   stoS
analyzinJ  your data.”
    The leathered  old Iace  aSSeared comSosed in the Sredawn dimness as he
sSoke. His  saSho-stained  liSs  were  drawn  into  a  straiJht   line  with   radial
creases sSreadinJ uSward.
    A  robed  man  sTuatted silently   on  sand  across Irom   Hawat,  aSSarently
unmoved by  the words.
    The two  crouched  beneath a rock  overhanJ  that looked  down  on  a wide,
shallow  sink. Dawn  was sSreadinJ over  the shattered outline  oI  cliIIs  across
the basin, touchinJ   everythinJ  with  Sink.  It  was cold  under the  overhanJ,  a
dry and  SenetratinJ  chill  leIt   over Irom   the niJht.   There had  been a warm
wind   Must beIore  dawn,  but   now   it   was  cold.   Hawat   could  hear   teeth
chatterinJ  behind him  amonJ the Iew  trooSers remaininJ  in  his Iorce.
    The  man  sTuattinJ   across Irom   Hawat   was  a Fremen   who  had  come
across the  sink  in   the Iirst   liJht   oI   Ialse  dawn,  skitterinJ   over  the  sand,
blendinJ  into the dunes, his  movements barely  discernible.
    The Fremen  e[tended   a IinJer  to  the  sand between  them, drew  a  IiJure
there. It looked  like  a bowl  with  an arrow sSillinJ   out oI  it. “There  are many
Harkonnen  Satrols,” he  said. He liIted   his IinJer,  Sointed  uSward across the
cliIIs  that Hawat  and his men had descended.
    Hawat nodded.
    Many patrols.  Yes.
    But  still   he  did  not  know   what  this   Fremen  wanted  and  this  rankled.
Mentat traininJ   was suSSosed to Jive a man the Sower to see motives.
    This  had been the worst  niJht  oI  Hawat’s  liIe.  He  had been at  TsimSo, a
Jarrison  villaJe,   buIIer  outSost  Ior  the  Iormer  caSital  city,  CarthaJ,   when
the reSorts oI  attack  beJan arrivinJ.   At   Iirst,  he’d  thouJht:  It’s  a  raid.  The
Harkonnens are  testing.
    But reSort Iollowed   reSort—Iaster  and Iaster.

236
   Two leJions landed at CarthaJ.
   Five   leJions—IiIty    briJades!—attackinJ   the   Duke’s   main  base  at
Arrakeen.
   A  leJion at Arsunt.
   Two battle JrouSs at SSlintered Rock.
   Then the reSorts became more detailed—there were ImSerial Sardaukar
amonJ the attackers—Sossibly two leJions oI  them. And  it  became clear
that the  invaders knew  Srecisely which  weiJht  oI   arms to  send where.
Precisely! SuSerb IntelliJence.
   Hawat’s   shocked Iury   had  mounted  until   it   threatened the  smooth
IunctioninJ oI his Mentat caSabilities. The size oI the attack struck his mind
like a Shysical blow.
   Now, hidinJ  beneath a bit oI desert rock, he nodded to himselI, Sulled his
torn and slashed tunic around him as thouJh wardinJ oII the cold shadows.
   The size of the attack.
   He  had always e[Sected their enemy to hire  an occasional liJhter Irom
the Guild  Ior  SrobinJ raids. That  was an ordinary  enouJh Jambit in  this
kind oI  House-to-House warIare. LiJhters landed and took  oII on  Arrakis
reJularly  to  transSort  the sSice  Ior  House  Atreides.  Hawat  had  taken
Srecautions aJainst random raids by Ialse sSice liJhters. For a  Iull  attack
they’d e[Sected no more than ten briJades.
   But  there were more than two thousand shiSs down on Arrakis at the last
count—not Must liJhters, but  IriJates,  scouts,  monitors, crushers, trooS-
carriers, dumS-bo[es….
   More than a hundred briJades—ten leJions!
   The  entire sSice income oI Arrakis  Ior  IiIty   years miJht Must cover the
cost oI such a venture.
   It  might.
   I  underestimated what the Baron  was willing  to  spend in attacking  us,
Hawat thouJht. Ifailedmy Duke.
   Then there was the matter oI the traitor.
   I  will live  long enough to see her strangled! he thouJht. I should’ve killed
that Bene Gesserit witch when I had the chance. There was no doubt in his
mind who  had betrayed them—the  Lady Jessica. She Iitted  all  the Iacts
available.
   “Your   man Gurney  Halleck  and  Sart  oI  his  Iorce  are saIe  with  our
smuJJler Iriends,” the Fremen said.

237
   “Good.”
   So Gurney will get off this hell planet. We’re not all gone.
   Hawat  Jlanced back at the huddle oI  his men. He had started the niJht
Must Sast with three hundred oI his Iinest. OI those, an even twenty remained
and halI  oI  them were wounded.  Some oI  them sleSt now, standinJ  uS,
leaninJ aJainst the rock, sSrawled on the sand beneath the rock. Their last
’thoSter, the one they’d been usinJ as a Jround-eIIect machine to carry their
wounded, had Jiven out Must beIore dawn. They had cut it uS with lasJuns
and hidden the Sieces, then worked their way down into this hidinJ Slace at
the edJe oI the basin.
   Hawat  had  only  a  rouJh  idea  oI  their  location—some  two  hundred
kilometers southeast oI  Arrakeen.  The main  traveled  ways between the
Shield Wall sietch communities were somewhere south oI them.
   The Fremen across Irom Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit  caS to
reveal sandy hair and  beard. The hair  was combed straiJht  back Irom  a
hiJh, thin Iorehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes oI the sSice diet.
Beard and mustache were stained at one side oI the mouth, his hair matted
there by Sressure oI the looSinJ catchtube Irom his nose SluJs.
   The man removed his SluJs, readMusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside
his nose.
   “II   you cross the sink  here this niJht,”  the Fremen said, “you  must not
use shields. There is a break in the wall….” He turned on his heels, Sointed
south. “…  there, and it is  oSen sand down to the erJ. Shields will   attract
a….” He hesitated. “…  worm. They don’t  oIten come in here, but a shield
will brinJ  one every time.”
   He  said  worm, Hawat  thouJht.  He  was going  to  say something else.
What? And what does he want of us?
   Hawat siJhed.
   He   could  not  recall  ever  beIore  beinJ  this   tired.  It   was  a  muscle
weariness that enerJy Sills were unable to ease.
   Those damnable Sardaukar!
   With   a selI-accusinJ  bitterness, he  Iaced the  thouJht  oI  the  soldier-
Ianatics and  the  ImSerial  treachery they   reSresented. His own  Mentat
assessment oI the data told him how  little  chance he had ever to  Sresent
evidence oI this treachery beIore the HiJh Council oI the Landsraad where
Mustice miJht be done.
   “Do  you wish to Jo to the smuJJlers?” the Fremen asked.

238
   “Is  it Sossible?”
   “The  way is lonJ.”
   “Fremen  don’t like to say no, ” Idaho had told him once.
   Hawat said: “You  haven’t yet told  me whether your SeoSle can helS my
wounded.”
   “They  are wounded.”
   The same damned answer every time!
   “We know  they’re wounded!” Hawat snaSSed. “That’s not the—”
   “Peace, Iriend,” the Fremen cautioned. “What do your wounded say? Are
there those amonJ them who can see the water need oI your tribe?”
   “We haven’t talked about water,” Hawat said. “We—”
   “I   can understand your  reluctance,” the  Fremen said. “They   are your
Iriends, your tribesmen. Do you have water?”
   “Not  enouJh.”
   The Fremen Jestured to Hawat’s tunic, the skin e[Sosed beneath it. “You
were cauJht in-sietch, without your suits. You must make a water decision,
Iriend.”
   “Can we hire your helS?”
   The  Fremen shruJJed. “You  have no water.”  He  Jlanced at the JrouS
behind Hawat. “How many oI your wounded would you sSend?”
   Hawat Iell  silent, starinJ at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their
communication was out oI  Shase. Word-sounds were not beinJ linked uS
here in the normal manner.
   “I   am ThuIir  Hawat,”  he said. “I  can  sSeak Ior my Duke.  I  will  make
Sromissory commitment now Ior your  helS. I wish a limited  Iorm  oI helS,
SreservinJ my Iorce lonJ  enouJh only  to kill   a traitor who  thinks herselI
beyond venJeance.”
   You wish our sidinJ in a vendetta?”
   “The  vendetta I’ll  handle myselI. I wish  to be Ireed oI resSonsibility Ior
my wounded that I may Jet about it.”
   The Fremen scowled. “How  can you  be resSonsible Ior your wounded?
They are  their  own  resSonsibility.  The water’s  at  issue, ThuIir   Hawat.
Would you have me take that decision away Irom you?”
   The man Sut a hand to a weaSon concealed beneath his robe.
   Hawat tensed, wonderinJ: Is there betrayal here?
   “What  do you Iear?” the Fremen demanded.

239
   These people and their disconcerting directness! Hawat sSoke cautiously.
“There’s a Srice on my head.”
   “Ah-h-h-h.”   The Fremen removed his hand Irom his weaSon. “You think
we have the  Byzantine corruStion. You  don’t  know  us. The Harkonnens
have not water enouJh to buy the smallest child amonJ us.”
   But  they had  the price  of  Guild  passage for  more than two  thousand
fighting ships, Hawat thouJht. And the size oI that Srice still staJJered him.
   “We  both  IiJht   Harkonnens,”  Hawat said.  “Should  we  not  share the
Sroblems and ways oI meetinJ the battle issue?”
   “We  are sharinJ,” the Fremen said. “I  have seen you IiJht  Harkonnens.
You are Jood. There’ve been times I’d   have aSSreciated your arm beside
me.”
   “Say where my arm may helS you,” Hawat said.
   “Who    knows?”   the  Fremen   asked.  “There   are  Harkonnen  Iorces
everywhere. But you still have not made the water decision or Sut it to your
wounded.”
   I  must be cautious, Hawat  told himselI.  There’s a thing  here that’s not
understood.
   He said: “Will  you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?”
   “StranJer-thinkinJ,”   the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone.
He Sointed to  the northwest across the cliIItoS.   “We watched  you come
across the sand last niJht.” He lowered his  arm. “You keeS your Iorce  on
the sliS-Iace oI the dunes. Bad. You have no stillsuits,  no water. You will
not last lonJ.”
   “The  ways oI Arrakis don’t come easily,” Hawat said.
   “Truth.  But we’ve killed  Harkonnens.”
   “What  do you do with your own wounded?” Hawat demanded.
   “Does  a man  not know  when he is  worth  savinJ?” the  Fremen asked.
“Your  wounded know  you  have  no water.”  He  tilted  his  head, lookinJ
sideways uS at Hawat.  “This  is  clearly  a time  Ior  water  decision. Both
wounded and unwounded must look to the tribe’s Iuture.”
   The tribe’s future, Hawat thouJht.  The tribe of Atreides. There’s sense in
that. He Iorced himselI to the Tuestion he had been avoidinJ.
   “Have  you word oI my Duke or his son?”
   Unreadable blue eyes stared uSward into Hawat’s. “Word?”
   “Their  Iate!” Hawat snaSSed.

240
   “Fate is  the same Ior everyone,” the Fremen said. “Your Duke, it is said,
has met his Iate. As to  the Lisan al-Gaib,  his son, that is  in Liet’s  hands.
Liet has not said.”
   I  knew the answer without asking, Hawat thouJht.
   He Jlanced back at his men. They were all awake now. They had heard.
They were starinJ out across the sand, the realization in their e[Sressions:
there was no returninJ to Caladan Ior them, and now Arrakis was lost.
   Hawat turned back to the Fremen. “Have you heard oI Duncan Idaho?”
   “He  was in the Jreat house when the shield went down,” the Fremen said.
“This I’ve  heard… no more.”
   She dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens, he thouJht. I was the
one who sat with my back to a door. How could she do this when it  meant
turning also against her own son? But … who knows how a Bene Gesserit
witch thinks… if you can call it thinking?
   Hawat  tried to  swallow in  a dry throat.  “When will   you hear about the
boy?”
   “We  know  little   oI  what haSSens in Arrakeen,”  the  Fremen said. He
shruJJed. “Who knows?”
   “You  have ways oI IindinJ out?”
   “PerhaSs.”  The Fremen rubbed at  the scar  beside his nose. “Tell   me,
ThuIir Hawat, do you  have knowledJe oI the biJ weaSons the Harkonnens
used?”
   The artillery,  Hawat thouJht bitterly. Who could have guessed they’d use
artillery in  this day of shields?
   “You  reIer to the artillery  they used to traS our SeoSle in the caves,” he
said. “I’ve … theoretical knowledJe oI such e[Slosive weaSons.”
   “Any  man who retreats into a cave which has only one oSeninJ deserves
to die,” the Fremen said.
   “Why  do you ask about these weaSons?”
   “Liet  wishes it.”
   Is that what he wants from us? Hawat wondered. He said: “Did you come
here seekinJ inIormation about the biJ Juns?”
   “Liet  wished to see one oI the weaSons Ior himselI.”
   “Then  you should Must Jo take one,” Hawat sneered.
   “Yes,”  the Fremen said. “We took one. We have it hidden where StilJar
can study it Ior Liet and where Liet can see it Ior himselI iI he wishes. But I

241
doubt he’ll  want to:  the weaSon is not  a very  Jood one. Poor desiJn Ior
Arrakis.”
   “You  … took one?” Hawat asked.
   “It   was a  Jood  IiJht,”   the Fremen said.  “We  lost only   two  men and
sSilled the water Irom more than a hundred oI theirs.”
   There were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thouJht. This desert madman
speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!
   “We  would not have lost the two  e[ceSt Ior those others IiJhtinJ  beside
the Harkonnens,” the Fremen said. “Some oI those are Jood IiJhters.”
   One  oI  Hawat’s  men  limSed Iorward,   looked  down  at the  sTuattinJ
Fremen. “Are you talkinJ about Sardaukar?”
   “He’s  talkinJ about Sardaukar,” Hawat said.
   “Sardaukar!”  the Fremen said, and there aSSeared to be Jlee in his voice.
“Ah-h-h, so that’s what they are! This was a Jood niJht  indeed. Sardaukar.
Which leJion? Do you know?”
   “We …  don’t know,” Hawat said.
   “Sardaukar,”  the Fremen mused. “Yet they wear Harkonnen clothinJ. Is
that not stranJe?”
   “The  EmSeror does not wish it known he IiJhts  aJainst a Great House,”
Hawat said.
   “But  you know they are Sardaukar.”
   “Who  am I?” Hawat asked bitterly.
   “You  are ThuIir Hawat,”  the man said matter-oI-Iactly. “Well,  we would
have learned it in time. We’ve  sent three oI them caStive to be Tuestioned
by Liet’s men.”
   Hawat’s  aide sSoke slowly, disbelieI  in  every word:  “You …  captured
Sardaukar?”
   “Only  three oI them,” the Fremen said. “They IouJht well.”
   If  only we’d had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thouJht. It
was a sour lament in his mind. If only we could’ve trained them and armed
them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we’d have had!
   “PerhaSs you   delay  because oI  worry  over  the  Lisan   al-Gaib,”  the
Fremen said. “II he is  truly the Lisan  al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do
not sSend thouJhts on a matter which has not been Sroved.”
   “I  serve the … Lisan  al-Gaib,” Hawat said. “His  welIare is  my concern.
I’ve SledJed myselI to this.”
   “You  are SledJed to his water?”

242
   Hawat Jlanced at his aide, who  was still starinJ at the Fremen, returned
his attention to the sTuattinJ IiJure. “To his water, yes.”
   “You  wish to return to Arrakeen, to the Slace oI his water?”
   “To  … yes, to the Slace oI his water.”
   “Why  did  you not say at Iirst it  was a water matter?” The Fremen stood
uS, seated his nose SluJs Iirmly.
   Hawat motioned with  his head Ior his aide to return to the others. With a
tired shruJ, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise
amonJ the men.
   The Fremen said: “There is always a way to water.”
   Behind  Hawat, a  man cursed. Hawat’s aide called:  “ThuIir!   Arkie  Must
died.”
   The  Fremen Sut a Iist  to his ear. “The  bond oI  water! It’s  a siJn!”   He
stared at Hawat. “We have a Slace nearby Ior acceStinJ the water. Shall I
call my men?”
   The aide returned to Hawat’s side, said: “ThuIir, a couSle oI the men leIt
wives in Arrakeen. They’re… well, you know how it is at a time like this.”
   The Fremen still  held his Iist  to his  ear. “Is it  the bond oI water, ThuIir
Hawat?” he demanded.
   Hawat’s  mind was racinJ. He sensed now the direction oI  the Fremen’s
words, but Ieared the  reaction oI  the tired  men under the  rock overhanJ
when they understood it.
   “The  bond oI water,” Hawat said.
   “Let  our tribes be Moined,” the Fremen said, and he lowered his Iist.
   As thouJh that were the siJnal, Iour men slid and droSSed down Irom the
rocks above them. They darted back  under the overhanJ, rolled  the dead
man in a loose robe, liIted him and beJan runninJ with  him alonJ the cliII
wall to the riJht. SSurts oI dust liIted around their runninJ Ieet.
   It  was over beIore Hawat’s tired men could Jather their wits.  The JrouS
with the body hanJinJ  like a sack in its  enIoldinJ robe was Jone around a
turn in the cliII.
   One oI Hawat’s men shouted: “Where they JoinJ with Arkie? He was—”
   “They’re  takinJ him to …  bury him,” Hawat said.
   “Fremen  don’t  bury  their dead!”  the  man barked. “Don’t   you  try  any
tricks on us, ThuIir. We know what they do. Arkie was one oI—”
   “Paradise were sure Ior a man who died in the service oI Lisan al-Gaib,”
the Fremen said. “II it  is the Lisan  al-Gaib you serve, as you have said it,

243
why raise mourninJ cries? The memory oI one who died in this Iashion will
live as lonJ as the memory oI man endures.”
   But  Hawat’s men advanced, anJry looks on their Iaces. One had caStured
a lasJun. He started to draw it.
   “StoS  riJht  where you  are!”  Hawat  barked. He  IouJht  down the  sick
IatiJue that JriSSed his muscles. “These SeoSle resSect our dead. Customs
diIIer, but the meaninJ’s the same.”
   “They’re   JoinJ to  render Arkie  down Ior  his  water,” the man  with the
lasJun snarled.
   “Is  it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?” the Fremen asked.
   He  doesn’t even see the  problem, Hawat  thouJht.  The naïveté oI   the
Fremen was IriJhteninJ.
   “They’re  concerned Ior a resSected comrade,” Hawat said.
   “We  will  treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own,”
the Fremen said. “This is  the bond oI  water. We know the  rites. A  man’s
Ilesh is his own; the water belonJs to the tribe.”
   Hawat sSoke Tuickly as the man with  the lasJun advanced another steS.
“Will  you now helS our wounded?”
   “One  does not Tuestion the bond,” the Fremen said. “We will do Ior you
what a tribe does Ior its own. First, we must Jet all oI you suited and see to
the necessities.”
   The man with the lasJun hesitated.
   Hawat’s aide said: “Are we buyinJ helS with Arkie’s  … water?”
   “Not  buyinJ,”  Hawat said. “We’ve Moined these SeoSle.”
   “Customs diIIer,”  one oI his men muttered.
   Hawat beJan to rela[.
   “And  they’ll  helS us Jet to Arrakeen?”
   “We   will    kill    Harkonnens,”  the   Fremen  said.  He   Jrinned.   “And
Sardaukar.” He steSSed backward, cuSSed his hands beside his ears and
tiSSed his head back, listeninJ. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: “An
aircraIt   comes.   Conceal  yourselves   beneath  the   rock    and   remain
motionless.”
   At  a Jesture Irom Hawat, his men obeyed.
   The  Fremen took Hawat’s arm, Sressed him back with  the others. “We
will  IiJht  in  the time  oI  IiJhtinJ,”   the man said. He  reached beneath his
robes, brouJht out a small caJe, liIted a creature Irom it.

244
   Hawat  recoJnized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its
blue-within-blue eyes.
   The Fremen stroked the bat, soothinJ it, crooninJ to it.  He bent over the
animal’s head, allowed a droS oI saliva to Iall Irom his tonJue into the bat’s
uSturned mouth. The bat stretched its winJs, but remained on the Fremen’s
oSened hand. The man took a tiny tube, held it  beside the bat’s head and
chattered into the tube; then, liItinJ the creature hiJh, he threw it uSward.
   The bat swooSed away beside the cliII and was lost to siJht.
   The Fremen Iolded the caJe, thrust it beneath his robe. AJain, he bent his
head, listeninJ. “They  Tuarter the  hiJh  country,”  he said. “One  wonders
who they seek uS there.”
   “It’s  known that we retreated in this direction,” Hawat said.
   “One  should never Sresume one is the sole obMect oI a hunt,” the Fremen
said. “Watch the other side oI the basin. You will see a thinJ.”
   Time Sassed.
   Some oI Hawat’s men stirred, whisSerinJ.
   “Remain silent as IriJhtened animals,” the Fremen hissed.
   Hawat  discerned movement near the oSSosite cliII—IlittinJ blurs  oI tan
on tan.
   “My   little  Iriend  carried his messaJe,” the Fremen said. “He  is a Jood
messenJer—day or niJht. I’ll be unhaSSy to lose that one.”
   The  movement across the sink  Iaded away. On the  entire Iour  to  Iive
kilometer e[Sanse oI sand nothinJ remained but the JrowinJ Sressure oI the
day’s heat—blurred columns oI risinJ air.
   “Be  most silent now,” the Fremen whisSered.
   A  Iile  oI  SloddinJ  IiJures emerJed Irom  a break  in the  oSSosite cliII,
headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they aSSeared to be Fremen, but
a curiously ineSt band. He counted si[ men makinJ heavy JoinJ  oI it  over
the dunes.
   A  “thwok-thwok”   oI ornithoSter winJs sounded hiJh to the riJht  behind
Hawat’s JrouS. The craIt came over the cliII wall above them—an Atreides
‘thoSter with Harkonnen battle colors sSlashed on it. The ’thoSter swooSed
toward the men crossinJ the sink.
   The JrouS there stoSSed on a dune crest, waved.
   The  ‘thoSter circled  once over them in  a tiJht  curve,  came back Ior  a
dust-shrouded landinJ in Iront oI the Fremen. Five men swarmed Irom the

245
’thoSter and Hawat saw  the dust-reSellent shimmerinJ oI  shields and, in
their motions, the hard comSetence oI Sardaukar.
   “Aiihh!   They use their stuSid shields,” the Fremen beside Hawat hissed.
He Jlanced toward the oSen south wall oI the sink.
   “They  are Sardaukar,” Hawat whisSered.
   “Good.”
   The Sardaukar aSSroached the waitinJ JrouS oI Fremen in an enclosinJ
halI-circle.  Sun  Jlinted  on  blades  held  ready. The  Fremen  stood in   a
comSact JrouS, aSSarently indiIIerent.
   AbruStly, the sand around the two JrouSs sSrouted Fremen. They were at
the ornithoSter, then in it. Where the two JrouSs had met at the dune crest, a
dust cloud Sartly obscured violent motion.
   Presently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standinJ.
   “They  leIt  only  three men in  their ’thoSter,”  the Fremen beside Hawat
said. “That  was Iortunate. I  don’t  believe we had  to damaJe the craIt  in
takinJ it.”
   Behind Hawat, one oI his men whisSered: “Those were Sardaukar!”
   “Did  you notice how well they IouJht?”  the Fremen asked.
   Hawat  took a deeS breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, Ielt
the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: “Yes, they
IouJht well, indeed.”
   The  caStured ’thoSter took  oII  with   a lurchinJ  IlaS  oI  winJs,  anJled
uSward to the south in a steeS, winJ-tucked climb.
   So these Fremen can handle ’thopters, too, Hawat thouJht.
   On  the distant dune, a Fremen waved a sTuare oI Jreen cloth:  once …
twice.
   “More  come!”  the Fremen beside Hawat barked. “Be ready. I’d hoSed to
have us away without more inconvenience.”
   Inconvenience! Hawat thouJht.
   He saw two more ’thoSters swooSinJ Irom hiJh in  the west onto an area
oI sand suddenly devoid oI visible Fremen. Only eiJht  sSlotches oI blue—
the bodies oI the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniIorms—remained at the scene
oI violence.
   Another  ’thoSter Jlided in over the cliII  wall  above Hawat. He drew in a
sharS breath as he saw it—a biJ trooS-carrier. It Ilew with the slow, sSread-
winJ heaviness oI a Iull load—like a Jiant bird cominJ to its nest.

246
   In  the distance, the SurSle IinJer oI a lasJun beam Ilicked Irom one oI the
divinJ ’thoSters. It laced across the sand, raisinJ a sharS trail oI dust.
   “The  cowards!” the Fremen beside Hawat rasSed.
   The trooS carrier settled toward the Satch oI blue-clad bodies. Its winJs
creSt out to Iull reach, beJan the cuSSinJ action oI a Tuick stoS.
   Hawat’s  attention was cauJht by a Ilash oI  sun on metal to the south, a
‘thoSter SlummetinJ there  in  a Sower dive,  winJs  Iolded Ilat  aJainst its
sides, its Mets a Jolden Ilare aJainst the dark  silvered Jray  oI  the sky. It
SlunJed like   an arrow  toward  the  trooS  carrier  which  was  unshielded
because oI the lasJun activity around it. StraiJht into the carrier the divinJ
’thoSter SlunJed.
   A  IlaminJ  roar shook the  basin. Rocks tumbled Irom the  cliII  walls  all
around. A  Jeyser oI  red-oranJe  shot skyward  Irom  the sand where  the
carrier and its comSanion ’thoSters had been—everythinJ there cauJht in
the Ilame.
   It  was the Fremen who took off in that captured ’thopter, Hawat thouJht.
He deliberately sacrificed  himself to get that carrier.  Great Mother!  What
are these Fremen?
   “A    reasonable exchange,”   said  the  Fremen  beside  Hawat.   “There
must’ve been three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their
water and make Slans to Jet another aircraIt.” He started to steS out oI their
rock-shadowed concealment.
   A  rain oI blue uniIorms came over the cliII wall in Iront  oI him, IallinJ  in
low-susSensor slowness. In the IlashinJ instant, Hawat had time to see that
they  were  Sardaukar, hard  Iaces  set  in  battle  Irenzy,  that  they   were
unshielded and each carried a kniIe in one hand, a stunner in the other.
   A  thrown kniIe  cauJht Hawat’s Fremen comSanion in the throat, hurlinJ
him backward, twistinJ  Iace down. Hawat had only  time to  draw his own
kniIe beIore blackness oI a stunner SroMectile Ielled him.

        Muad‘Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think
        of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you
        cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad’Dib could not always choose to look across the
        mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice
        of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us “The vision
        of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door.” And always, he
        fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning “That path leads ever down into
        stagnation. ”
                                                                —from “Arrakis AwakeninJ” by the Princess Irulan



 
  As THE  ornithoSters    Jlided   out  oI  the  niJht    above  them,   Paul  Jrabbed   his
mother’s   arm,  snaSSed: “Don’t    move!”
    Then  he  saw  the  lead craIt   in  the  moonliJht,    the  way  its  winJs   cuSSed  to
brake  Ior  landinJ,   the  reckless  dash  oI  the hands  at the  controls.
    “It’s   Idaho,”   he  breathed.
    The  craIt   and  its  comSanions   settled   into   the  basin  like   a covey   oI  birds
cominJ    to  nest.   Idaho   was  out   oI   his   ’thoSter   and   runninJ    toward    them
beIore   the  dust   settled.   Two   IiJures   in   Fremen   robes   Iollowed    him.    Paul
recoJnized   one:  the tall,   sandy-bearded   Kynes.
    “This   way!”    Kynes  called   and he  veered  leIt.
    Behind    Kynes,    other   Fremen    were   throwinJ     Iabric    covers    over   their
ornithoSters.   The  craIt  became  a row   oI  shallow   dunes.
    Idaho   skidded   to  a  stoS  in  Iront    oI  Paul,   saluted.  “M’Lord,      the  Fremen
have a temSorary   hidinJ    Slace nearby   where  we—”
    “What   about  that  back  there?”
    Paul   Sointed   to   the  violence    above   the   distant   cliII—the      MetIlares, the
SurSle beams  oI  lasJuns  lacinJ   the  desert.
    A  rare   smile   touched   Idaho’s   round,   Slacid   Iace.  “M’Lord      …  Sire,   I’ve
leIt  them  a little   sur—”
    GlarinJ     white    liJht    Iilled     the   desert—briJht      as   a  sun,   etchinJ    their
shadows  onto   the  rock   Iloor    oI  the  ledJe.   In  one   sweeSinJ   motion,    Idaho
had  Paul’s   arm  in   one  hand,  Jessica’s   shoulder   in   the  other,   hurlinJ    them
down  oII  the  ledJe   into  the  basin.  They  sSrawled   toJether   in  the  sand as the
roar  oI  an e[Slosion    thundered   over  them.  Its  shock   wave  tumbled   chiSs  oII
the rock  ledJe   they  had vacated.
    Idaho  sat  uS, brushed  sand  Irom   himselI.

248
   “Not  the Iamily atomics!”  Jessica said. “I thouJht—”
   “You  Slanted a shield back there,” Paul said.
   “A   biJ one turned to Iull  Iorce,”  Idaho said. “A  lasJun beam touched it
and….” He shruJJed.
   “Subatomic Iusion,”  Jessica said. “That’s a danJerous weaSon.”
   “Not  weaSon, m’Lady, deIense. That scum will think  twice beIore usinJ
lasJuns another time.”
   The  Fremen Irom the ornithoSters stoSSed above them. One called in a
low voice: “We should Jet under cover, Iriends.”
   Paul Jot to his Ieet as Idaho helSed Jessica uS.
   “That  blast will attract considerable attention, Sire,” Idaho said.
   Sire, Paul thouJht.
   The  word  had  such a  stranJe sound when  directed at  him.  Sire  had
always been his Iather.
   He  Ielt   himselI  touched brieIly   by  his  Sowers oI  Srescience, seeinJ
himselI inIected by the wild race consciousness that was movinJ the human
universe toward chaos. The vision leIt him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to
Juide him  alonJ the edJe oI  the basin to a  rock SroMection. Fremen there
were oSeninJ a way down into the sand with their comSaction tools.
   “May  I take your Sack, Sire?” Idaho asked.
   “It’s  not heavy, Duncan,” Paul said.
   “You  have no body shield,” Idaho said. “Do you wish mine?” He Jlanced
at the distant cliII. “Not likely  there’ll be any more lasJun activity about.”
   “KeeS your shield, Duncan. Your riJht arm is shield enouJh Ior me.”
   Jessica saw the way the Sraise took eIIect,  how Idaho moved closer to
Paul, and she thouJht: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.
   The  Fremen removed a rock SluJ that oSened a SassaJe down into the
native basement comSle[ oI the desert. A camouIlaJe cover was riJJed Ior
the oSeninJ.
   “This  way,”  one oI  the Fremen said, and he led them  down rock  steSs
into darkness.
   Behind  them, the  cover blotted  out the  moonliJht.  A  dim  Jreen Jlow
came alive ahead, revealinJ  the steSs and rock walls,  a  turn to  the leIt.
Robed Fremen  were  all  around  them  now,  SressinJ  downward.  They
rounded the corner, Iound another down-slantinJ SassaJe. It oSened into a
rouJh cave chamber.

249
   Kynes stood beIore them, Mubba hood thrown back. The neck oI his still-
suit JlisteninJ in the Jreen liJht.  His lonJ hair and beard were mussed. The
blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.
   In  the  moment  oI  encounter, Kynes wondered  at himselI:  Why  am I
helping these people? It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done. It could
doom me with them.
   Then  he looked sTuarely at Paul, seeinJ the boy who  had taken on the
mantle oI manhood, maskinJ JrieI, suSSressinJ all e[ceSt the Sosition that
now must be assumed—the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment
the dukedom still  e[isted  and solely because oI this youth—and  this was
not a thinJ to be taken liJhtly.
   Jessica Jlanced once around the chamber, reJisterinJ it on her senses in
the Bene Gesserit way—a laboratory, a civil Slace Iull oI anJles and sTuares
in the ancient manner.
   “This  is one oI the ImSerial EcoloJical TestinJ Stations my Iather wanted
as advance bases,” Paul said.
   His father wanted! Kynes thouJht.
   And   aJain  Kynes  wondered  at  himselI.  Am  I   foolish   to  aid  these
fugitives? Why am I doing it?  It’d  be so easy to take them now, to buy the
Harkonnen trust with them.
   Paul  Iollowed  his  mother’s  e[amSle,  JestaltinJ  the  room, seeinJ  the
workbench down one side, the walls oI Ieatureless rock. Instruments lined
the bench—dials JlowinJ,  wire  Jride[  Slanes with IlutinJ   Jlass emerJinJ
Irom them. An ozone smell Sermeated the Slace.
   Some oI the Fremen moved on around a concealinJ anJle in the chamber
and new sounds started there—machine couJhs, the whinnies oI sSinninJ
belts and multidrives.
   Paul looked to the end oI the room, saw caJes with small animals in them
stacked aJainst the wall.
   “You’ve  recoJnized this  Slace correctly,” Kynes said. “For  what  would
you use such a Slace, Paul Atreides?”
   “To  make this Slanet a Iit Slace Ior humans,” Paul said.
   Perhaps that’s why I help them, Kynes thouJht.
   The  machine sounds abruStly hummed away to  silence. Into  this void
there came a thin animal sTueak Irom the caJes. It was cut oII abruStly as
thouJh in embarrassment.

250
   Paul returned his attention to the caJes, saw that the animals were brown-
winJed bats. An  automatic Ieeder e[tended Irom  the side wall  across the
caJes.
   A  Fremen emerJed Irom the hidden area oI the chamber, sSoke to Kynes:
“Liet, the Iield-Jenerator eTuiSment is not workinJ. I am unable to mask us
Irom Sro[imity  detectors.”
   “Can you reSair it?” Kynes asked.
   “Not  Tuickly. The Sarts….” The man shruJJed.
   “Yes,”  Kynes said. “Then we’ll  do without  machinery. Get a hand SumS
Ior air out to the surIace.”
   “Immediately.”  The man hurried away.
   Kynes turned back to Paul. “You Jave a Jood answer.”
   Jessica marked the easy rumble oI the man’s voice. It was a royal voice,
accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reIerence to him as
Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter eJo, the other Iace oI the tame SlanetoloJist.
   “We’re  most JrateIul Ior your helS, Doctor Kynes,” she said.
   “Mm-m-m,   we’ll  see,” Kynes said. He nodded to one oI his men. “SSice
coIIee in my Tuarters, Shamir.”
   “At  once, Liet,”  the man said.
   Kynes  indicated an arched oSeninJ in the side wall  oI the  chamber. “II
you Slease?”
   Jessica allowed herselI a reJal nod beIore acceStinJ. She saw Paul Jive a
hand siJnal to Idaho, tellinJ him to mount Juard here.
   The SassaJe, two Saces deeS, oSened throuJh a heavy door into a sTuare
oIIice  liJhted  by Jolden  JlowJlobes.  Jessica Sassed her hand across the
door as she entered, was startled to identiIy Slasteel.
   Paul steSSed three Saces into the room, droSSed his Sack to the Iloor. He
heard the door close behind him, studied the Slace—about eiJht meters to a
side, walls oI natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal IilinJ cabinets on
their riJht.  A   low  desk with  milk   Jlass toS shot Iull   oI  yellow  bubbles
occuSied the room’s center. Four susSensor chairs rinJed the desk.
   Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair Ior Jessica. She sat down, notinJ
the way her son e[amined the room.
   Paul  remained standinJ  Ior  another eyeblink.  A  Iaint  anomaly  in  the
room’s air currents told him there was a secret e[it to their riJht behind the
IilinJ  cabinets.
   “Will   you sit down, Paul Atreides?” Kynes asked.

251
   How carefully  he avoids my title, Paul thouJht. But he acceSted the chair,
remained silent while Kynes sat down.
   “You  sense that Arrakis could  be a Saradise,” Kynes said. “Yet, as you
see, the ImSerium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers aIter
the sSice!”
   Paul held uS his thumb with its ducal siJnet. “Do you see this rinJ?”
   “Yes.”
   “Do  you know its siJniIicance?”
   Jessica turned sharSly to stare at her son.
   “Your  Iather  lies dead in the  ruins oI  Arrakeen,” Kynes  said. “You are
technically the Duke.”
   “I’m   a soldier oI the ImSerium,” Paul said, “technically a hatchetman.”
   Kynes Iace darkened. “Even with the EmSeror’s Sardaukar standinJ over
your Iather’s body?”
   “The   Sardaukar are  one  thinJ,  the  leJal  source  oI  my   authority  is
another,” Paul said.
   “Arrakis   has  its  own  way  oI  determininJ  who   wears the  mantle  oI
authority,” Kynes said.
   And  Jessica, turninJ back to  look at  him, thouJht:  There’s steel in this
man that no  one has taken the temper out  of… and  we’ve need of steel.
Paul’s doing a dangerous thing.
   Paul  said: “The  Sardaukar on Arrakis are a  measure oI how much our
beloved EmSeror Ieared my Iather. Now, I will Jive  the Padishah EmSeror
reasons to Iear the—”
   “Lad,”  Kynes said, “there are thinJs you don’t—”
   “You  will  address me as Sire or My Lord,” Paul said.
   Gently, Jessica thouJht.
   Kynes  stared at Paul, and  Jessica noted the Jlint  oI  admiration in  the
SlanetoloJist’s Iace, the touch oI humor there.
   “Sire,”  Kynes said.
   “I    am  an   embarrassment to   the  EmSeror,”  Paul   said.  “I    am  an
embarrassment to all who would divide  Arrakis as their  sSoil. As I  live, I
shall continue to be such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and
choke them to death!”
   “Words,”  Kynes said.
   Paul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: “You have a leJend oI the Lisan
al-Gaib here, the Voice Irom  the Outer  World, the one who  will  lead  the

252
Fremen to Saradise. Your men have—”
   “SuSerstition!”  Kynes said.
   “PerhaSs,” Paul aJreed. “Yet SerhaSs not. SuSerstitions sometimes have
stranJe roots and stranJer branchinJs.”
   “You  have a Slan,” Kynes said. “This much is obvious… Sire.”
   “Could  your  Fremen Srovide me with SrooI Sositive that  the Sardaukar
are here in Harkonnen uniIorm?”
   “Quite  likely.”
   “The  EmSeror  will  Sut  a Harkonnen back  in  Sower here,”  Paul said.
“PerhaSs even Beast  Rabban. Let  him.  Once  he  has involved   himselI
beyond escaSinJ his Juilt, let the EmSeror Iace the Sossibility oI  a Bill  oI
Particulars laid beIore the Landsraad. Let him answer there where—”
   “Paul!”  Jessica said.
   “Granted  that  the Landsraad HiJh  Council  acceSts your case,” Kynes
said, “there  could  be  only   one outcome:  Jeneral  warIare  between the
ImSerium and the Great Houses.”
   “Chaos,”  Jessica said.
   “But  I’d  Sresent my case to the EmSeror,” Paul said, “and Jive  him  an
alternative to chaos.”
   Jessica sSoke in a dry tone: “Blackmail?”
   “One  oI  the tools oI  statecraIt, as you’ve said yourselI,”  Paul said, and
Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. “The EmSeror has no sons, only
dauJhters.”
   “You’d  aim Ior the throne?” Jessica asked.
   “The  EmSeror will not risk  havinJ the ImSerium shattered by total war,”
Paul said. “Planets blasted, disorder everywhere—he’ll not risk that.”
   “This  is a desSerate Jamble you SroSose,” Kynes said.
   “What  do  the Great Houses oI  the Landsraad Iear most?”  Paul asked.
“They  Iear   most  what  is  haSSeninJ here  riJht   now  on   Arrakis—the
Sardaukar SickinJ them oII  one by one. That’s why  there is a Landsraad.
This is the Jlue oI  the Great Convention. Only in union  do they match the
ImSerial Iorces.”
   “But  they’re—”
   “This  is what they Iear,” Paul said. “Arrakis would become a rallyinJ cry.
Each oI  them would  see himselI  in  my Iather—cut  out  oI  the herd and
killed.”
   Kynes sSoke to Jessica: “Would his Slan work?”

253
   “I’m   no Mentat,” Jessica said.
   “But  you are Bene Gesserit.”
   She shot a SrobinJ stare at him, said: “His Slan has Jood Soints and bad
Soints… as any Slan would  at this  staJe. A  Slan deSends as much uSon
e[ecution as it does uSon conceSt.”
   “  ‘Law  is the ultimate  science,’ ” Paul Tuoted. “Thus it  reads above the
EmSeror’s door. I SroSose to show him law.”
   “And   I’m  not  sure I  could trust  the Serson who conceived this  Slan,”
Kynes said. “Arrakis has its own Slan that we—”
   “From  the throne,”  Paul said, “I  could make a Saradise oI Arrakis  with
the wave oI a hand. This is the coin I oIIer Ior your suSSort.”
   Kynes stiIIened. “My  loyalty’s not Ior  sale, Sire.”
   Paul stared across the desk at him, meetinJ the cold Jlare oI those blue-
within-blue eyes, studyinJ  the bearded Iace, the commandinJ aSSearance.
A harsh smile touched Paul’s liSs and he said: “Well sSoken. I aSoloJize.”
   Kynes   met  Paul’s  stare  and,  Sresently, said:  “No    Harkonnen  ever
admitted error. PerhaSs you’re not like them, Atreides.”
   “It  could be a Iault in their education,” Paul said. “You say you’re not Ior
sale, but I believe I’ve  the coin  you’ll  acceSt. For your loyalty  I  oIIer my
loyalty to you… totally.”
   My   son   has  the  Atreides  sincerity,   Jessica thouJht.   He   has  that
tremendous, almost naïve honor—and what a powerful force that truly is.
   She saw that Paul’s words had shaken Kynes.
   “This  is nonsense,” Kynes said. “You’re Must a boy and—”
   “I’m   the Duke,” Paul said. “I’m an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken
such a bond.”
   Kynes swallowed.
   “When  I  say totally,”   Paul said, “I   mean without  reservation. I would
Jive my liIe Ior  you.”
   “Sire!”   Kynes said, and the word was torn Irom him, but Jessica saw that
he was not now sSeakinJ to a boy  oI IiIteen,  but to  a man, to a  suSerior.
Now Kynes meant the word.
   In  this  moment he’d  give  his life  for   Paul, she  thouJht. How  do  the
Atreides accomplish this thing so Tuickly, so easily?
   “I  know you mean this,” Kynes said. “Yet the Harkon—”
   The door behind Paul slammed oSen. He whirled to see reelinJ violence
—shoutinJ, the clash oI steel, wa[-imaJe Iaces JrimacinJ in the SassaJe.

254
   With   his  mother beside him,  Paul  leaSed Ior  the  door, seeinJ  Idaho
blockinJ  the SassaJe, his blood-Sitted eyes there visible throuJh a  shield
blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs oI  steel choSSinJ Iutilely at the  shield.
There was the oranJe Iire-mouth oI a stunner reSelled by the shield. Idaho’s
blades were throuJh it all, Ilick-IlickinJ,  red driSSinJ Irom them.
   Then  Kynes was  beside Paul and they  threw  their weiJht   aJainst the
door.
   Paul  had  one  last   JlimSse  oI  Idaho   standinJ  aJainst  a  swarm  oI
Harkonnen uniIorms—his MerkinJ, controlled staJJers, the black Joat hair
with a red blossom oI death in it. Then the door was closed and there came
a snick as Kynes threw the bolts.
   “I  aSSear to’ve decided,” Kynes said.
   “Someone detected your machinery beIore it was shut down,” Paul said.
He Sulled his mother away Irom the door, met the desSair in her eyes.
   “I   should’ve susSected trouble when the coIIee Iailed to arrive,”  Kynes
said.
   “You’ve  a bolt hole out oI here,” Paul said. “Shall we use it?”
   Kynes took a deeS breath, said: “This door should hold Ior at least twenty
minutes aJainst all but a lasJun.”
   “They’ll   not use a lasJun Ior Iear we’ve shields on this side,” Paul said.
   “Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniIorm,” Jessica whisSered.
   They could hear SoundinJ on the door now, rhythmic blows.
   Kynes  indicated  the cabinets  aJainst the  riJht-hand  wall,  said:  “This
way.”  He  crossed to the  Iirst   cabinet, oSened a drawer,  maniSulated a
handle within it. The entire wall oI cabinets swunJ oSen to e[Sose the black
mouth oI a tunnel. “This door also is Slasteel,” Kynes said.
   “You  were well SreSared,” Jessica said.
   “We   lived  under  the Harkonnens  Ior  eiJhty  years,”  Kynes  said.  He
herded them into the darkness, closed the door.
   In  the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the Iloor ahead
oI her.
   Kynes’  voice came Irom behind them: “We’ll  seSarate here. This wall is
touJher. It’ll  stand Ior at least an hour. Follow  the arrows like  that one on
the Iloor.  They’ll  be  e[tinJuished  by your  SassaJe. They lead throuJh a
maze to another e[it where I’ve  secreted a ‘thoSter. There’s a storm across
the desert toniJht. Your only hoSe is to run Ior that storm, dive into the toS

255
oI it, ride with  it. My SeoSle have done this in stealinJ ’thoSters. II you stay
hiJh in the storm you’ll survive.”
   “What  oI you?” Paul asked.
   “I’ll   try  to escaSe another way. II I’m caStured … well, I’m still ImSerial
PlanetoloJist. I can say I was your caStive.”
   Running like cowards, Paul thouJht. But how else can I live to avenge my
father? He turned to Iace the door.
   Jessica heard him move, said “Duncan’s dead, Paul. You saw the wound.
You can do nothinJ Ior him.”
   “I’ll   take Iull Sayment Ior them all one day,” Paul said.
   “Not  unless you hurry now,” Kynes said.
   Paul Ielt the man’s hand on his shoulder.
   “Where will  we meet, Kynes?” Paul asked.
   “I’ll    send Fremen searchinJ Ior you. The storm’s Sath is known. Hurry
now, and the Great Mother Jive you sSeed and luck.”
   They heard him Jo, a scramblinJ in the blackness.
   Jessica  Iound  Paul’s   hand,  Sulled  him   Jently.  “We   must   not  Jet
seSarated,” she said.
   “Yes.”
   He Iollowed  her across the Iirst arrow, seeinJ it Jo black as they touched
it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.
   They crossed it, saw it e[tinJuish itselI, saw another arrow ahead.
   They were runninJ now.
   Plans  within plans  within plans  within plans,  Jessica thouJht. Have we
become part of someone else’s plan now?
   The  arrows  led them  around turninJs,  Sast side oSeninJs only  dimly
sensed in the Iaint luminescence. Their way slanted downward Ior a time,
then uS, ever uS. They came Iinally  to  steSs, rounded a corner and were
brouJht short by a JlowinJ wall with a dark handle visible in its center.
   Paul Sressed the handle.
   The  wall  swunJ  away Irom  them. LiJht   Ilared  to reveal  a rock-hewn
cavern with an ornithoSter sTuattinJ in  its  center. A Ilat  Jray wall  with  a
doorsiJn on it loomed beyond the aircraIt.
   “Where did  Kynes Jo?” Jessica asked.
   “He  did what any Jood Juerrilla  leader would,” Paul said. “He seSarated
us into two Sarties and arranJed that he couldn’t reveal where we are iI he’s
caStured. He won’t really know.”

256
   Paul drew her into the room, notinJ  how their Ieet kicked uS dust on the
Iloor.
   “No  one’s been here Ior a lonJ time,” he said.
   “He  seemed conIident the Fremen could Iind us,” she said.
   “I  share that conIidence.”
   Paul released her hand, crossed to the ornithoSter’s leIt door, oSened it,
and secured his Sack in the rear. “This shiS’s Sro[imity  masked,” he said.
“Instrument Sanel has remote door control, liJht control. EiJhty years under
the Harkonnens tauJht them to be thorouJh.”
   Jessica leaned aJainst the craIt’s other side, catchinJ her breath.
   “The  Harkonnens will   have a coverinJ  Iorce over this  area,” she said.
“They’re  not  stuSid.”  She considered her direction  sense, Sointed riJht.
“The storm we saw is that way.”
   Paul nodded, IiJhtinJ  an abruSt reluctance to move. He knew its  cause,
but Iound no helS in the knowledJe. Somewhere this niJht he had Sassed a
decision-ne[us into the deeS unknown. He knew the time-area surroundinJ
them, but the here-and-now e[isted as a Slace oI mystery. It was as thouJh
he had seen himselI Irom a distance Jo out oI siJht down into a valley. OI
the countless Saths uS out oI that valley, some miJht carry a Paul Atreides
back into siJht, but many would not.
   “The  lonJer we wait the better SreSared they’ll be,” Jessica said.
   “Get  in and straS yourselI down,” he said.
   He Moined her in the ornithoSter, still wrestlinJ with the thouJht that this
was blind Jround, unseen in any Srescient vision. And he realized with an
abruSt sense oI shock that he had been JivinJ more and more  reliance to
Srescient memory and it had weakened him Ior this Sarticular emerJency.
   “II  you  rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.” It was a Bene
Gesserit a[iom.  He took  it to  himselI  now, SromisinJ never aJain  to Iall
into that traS … iI he lived throuJh this.
   Paul Iastened his saIety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked
the  aircraIt.  The  winJs   were  at  Iull    sSread-rest, their  delicate  metal
interleavinJs e[tended.  He touched  the retractor bar,  watched the winJs
shorten Ior Met-boost take-oII the way Gurney Halleck had tauJht him. The
starter switch moved easily. Dials on the instrument Sanel came alive as the
MetSods were armed. Turbines beJan their low hissinJ.
   “Ready?” he asked.
   “Yes.”

257
   He touched the remote control Ior liJhts.
   Darkness blanketed them.
   His  hand  was a  shadow aJainst the  luminous dials  as he  triSSed the
remote door control.  GratinJ sounded ahead oI them.  A  cascade oI sand
swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul’s cheeks. He closed
his door, IeelinJ the sudden Sressure.
   A  wide Satch oI dust-blurred stars Iramed in  anJular darkness aSSeared
where  the  door-wall   had  been.  StarliJht   deIined   a  shelI   beyond,  a
suJJestion oI sand riSSles.
   Paul  deSressed the JlowinJ  action-seTuence switch on his  Sanel. The
winJs snaSSed back and down, hurlinJ the ’thoSter out oI  its nest. Power
surJed Irom the MetSods as the winJs locked into liIt attitude.
   Jessica let her hands ride liJhtly on the dual controls, IeelinJ the sureness
oI her son’s movements. She was IriJhtened, yet e[hilarated.  Now, Paul’s
training is our only hope, she thouJht. His youth and swiftness.
   Paul Ied  more Sower to the MetSods. The ’thoSter banked, sinkinJ them
into their  seats as a dark wall  liIted  aJainst the stars ahead. He Jave the
craIt more winJ,  more Sower. Another burst oI liItinJ   winJbeats and they
came out over rocks, silver-Irosted anJles and outcroSSinJs in the starliJht.
The dust-reddened second moon showed itselI above the horizon to  their
riJht, deIininJ the ribbon trail oI  the storm.
   Paul’s hands danced over the controls. WinJs snicked in to beetle stubs.
G-Iorce Sulled at their Ilesh as the craIt came around in a tiJht bank.
   “JetIlares behind us!” Jessica said.
   “I  saw them.”
   He slammed the Sower arm Iorward.
   Their  ’thoSter leaSed like a IriJhtened animal,  surJed southwest toward
the storm  and the Jreat  curve oI  desert. In  the  near distance, Paul saw
scattered shadows tellinJ  where  the line   oI  rocks ended,  the basement
comSle[ sinkinJ   beneath the dunes. Beyond stretched moonlit  IinJernail
shadows—dunes diminishinJ one into another.
   And  above the horizon  climbed the  Ilat  immensity oI  the storm  like  a
wall aJainst the stars.
   SomethinJ Marred the ’thoSter.
   “Shellburst!”   Jessica JasSed. “They’re  usinJ  some  kind  oI  SroMectile
weaSon.”

258
   She saw a sudden animal Jrin on Paul’s Iace. “They seem to be avoidinJ
their lasJuns,” he said.
   “But  we’ve no shields!”
   “Do  they know that?”
   AJain  the ’thoSter shuddered.
   Paul twisted to Seer back. “Only one oI them aSSears to be Iast enouJh to
keeS uS with us.”
   He  returned his attention to their  course, watchinJ the storm wall  Jrow
hiJh in Iront oI them. It loomed like a tanJible solid.
   “ProMectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaSonry—that’s one thinJ
we’ll Jive  the Fremen,” Paul whisSered.
   “The  storm,” Jessica said. “Hadn’t you better turn?”
   “What  about the shiS behind us?”
   “He’s  SullinJ uS.”
   “Now!”
   Paul  stubbed the  winJs,   banked hard  leIt  into   the deceStively  slow
boilinJ oI the storm wall, Ielt his cheeks Sull in the G-Iorce.
   They aSSeared to Jlide into a slow cloudinJ oI dust that Jrew heavier and
heavier until it  blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraIt became a
lonJ, horizontal whisSer oI darkness liJhted only by the Jreen luminosity oI
the instrument Sanel.
   ThrouJh  Jessica’s mind Ilashed all the warninJs about such storms—that
they cut metal like butter, etched Ilesh to bone and ate away the bones. She
Ielt the buIIetinJ oI  dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul IouJht the
controls. She saw him choS the Sower, Ielt the shiS buck. The metal around
them hissed and trembled.
   “Sand!”  Jessica shouted.
   She saw the neJative shake oI his head in the liJht Irom the Sanel. “Not
much sand this hiJh.”
   But she could Ieel them sinkinJ deeSer into the maelstrom.
   Paul sent the winJs to their Iull soarinJ lenJth, heard them creak with the
strain. He  keSt  his  eyes Ii[ed   on  the  instruments,  JlidinJ   by  instinct,
IiJhtinJ Ior  altitude.
   The sound oI their SassaJe diminished.
   The  ’thoSter beJan rollinJ  oII  to  the leIt.  Paul Iocused on the JlowinJ
Jlobe within the attitude curve, IouJht his craIt back to level IliJht.

259
   Jessica had the eerie IeelinJ that they were standinJ still, that all motion
was e[ternal.  A  vaJue tan IlowinJ   aJainst the windows,  a rumblinJ  hiss
reminded her oI the Sowers around them.
   Winds  to  seven  or  eight   hundred kilometers  an   hour,  she thouJht.
Adrenalin  edJiness Jnawed  at  her.  I   must  not  fear,  she told   herselI,
mouthinJ the words oI the Bene Gesserit litany. Fear is the mind-killer.
   Slowly  her lonJ years oI traininJ Srevailed.
   Calmness returned.
   “We have the tiJer by the tail,” Paul whisSered. “We can’t Jo down, can’t
land… and I don’t think I can liIt us out oI this. We’ll  have to ride it out.”
   Calmness drained out  oI her. Jessica Ielt  her teeth chatterinJ, clamSed
them toJether. Then she heard Paul’s voice, low and controlled, recitinJ the
litany:
   “Fear   is  the   mind-killer.   Fear  is  the   little   death  that  brinJs   total
obliteration. I will  Iace my Iear. I will  Sermit it to Sass over me and throuJh
me. And when it has Jone Sast me I will turn to see Iear’s Sath. Where the
Iear has Jone there will be nothinJ. Only I will remain.”

        What do you despise? By this are you truly known.
                                                         —from“Manual of Muad‘Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  “THEY ARE  dead, Baron,”   said Iakin  NeIud,   the Juard  caStain. “Both   the
woman and the boy  are certainly  dead.”
    The  Baron  Vladimir    Harkonnen   sat uS  in  the  sleeS  susSensors oI  his
Srivate   Tuarters.   Beyond    these   Tuarters    and   enclosinJ    him    like    a
multishelled   eJJ  stretched  the sSace IriJate   he  had Jrounded   on Arrakis.
Here  in  his  Tuarters,  thouJh,   the  shiS’s  harsh  metal  was  disJuised   with
draSeries, with Iabric  SaddinJs  and rare art obMects.
    “It  is a certainty,”  the Juard  caStain said. “They  are dead.”
    The Baron  shiIted  his Jross  body in  the susSensors, Iocused his attention
on an  ebaline  statue  oI  a  leaSinJ  boy  in  a  niche  across  the room.   SleeS
Iaded Irom  him.  He straiJhtened  the Sadded susSensor beneath the Iat Iolds
oI  his neck,  stared  across the  sinJle  JlowJlobe    oI  his  bedchamber  to  the
doorway where  CaStain NeIud  stood blocked  by the Sentashield.
    “They’re  certainly   dead, Baron,”  the man reSeated.
    The  Baron  noted  the  trace  oI  semuta dullness   in  NeIud’s  eyes.  It  was
obvious the  man had been  deeS within  the druJ’s  raSture when  he received
this reSort, and had stoSSed only to  take the antidote beIore  rushinJ  here.
    “I  have a Iull  reSort,”  NeIud said.
    Let him  sweat a little,  the  Baron thouJht.  One  must always  keep the tools
of statecraft  sharp and ready.  Power and  fear—sharp  and ready.
    “Have  you seen their bodies?”  the Baron  rumbled.
    NeIud hesitated.
    “Well?”
    “M‘Lord    …  they were  seen to dive  into  a sandstorm…  winds  over  eiJht
hundred kilometers.   NothinJ  survives  such a  storm, m’Lord.   NothinJ!   One
oI our own  craIt  was destroyed in  the Sursuit.”
    The Baron  stared at NeIud,  notinJ   the nervous  twitch  in  the scissors line
oI the man’s Maw muscles, the way the chin moved  as NeIud swallowed.
    “You  have seen the bodies?” the Baron  asked.
    “M’Lord—”

261
   “For  what  SurSose do you come here rattlinJ  your  armor?” the  Baron
roared. “To tell me a thinJ is certain when it is not? Do you think I’ll  Sraise
you Ior such stuSidity, Jive you another Sromotion?”
   NeIud’s Iace went bone Sale.
   Look at the chicken, the Baron thouJht. I am surrounded by such useless
clods. If I scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he’d
peck at it:
   “The  man Idaho led us to them, then?” the Baron asked.
   “Yes, m’Lord!”
   Look  how he blurts  out his answer, the Baron thouJht.  He said: “They
were attemStinJ to Ilee to the Fremen, eh?”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “Is  there more to this… reSort?”
   “The  ImSerial  PlanetoloJist, Kynes, is  involved,  m’Lord.  Idaho  Moined
this Kynes under mysterious circumstances… I miJht  even say suspicious
circumstances.”
   “So?”
   “They  … ah, Iled toJether to a Slace in the desert where it’s aSSarent the
boy and his mother were hidinJ. In  the e[citement oI  the chase, several oI
our JrouSs were cauJht in a lasJun-shield e[Slosion.”
   “How  many did we lose?”
   “I’m   … ah, not sure yet, m’Lord.”
   He’s lying, the Baron thouJht. It must’ve been pretty bad.
   “The  ImSerial  lackey, this Kynes,”  the  Baron said. “He  was SlayinJ  a
double Jame, eh?”
   “I’d   stake my reSutation on it, m’Lord.”
   His reputation!
   “Have  the man killed,” the Baron said.
   “M’Lord!    Kynes is  the Imperial  PlanetoloJist, His  MaMesty’s own serv
—”
   “Make  it look like  an accident, then!”
   “M’Lord,   there were Sardaukar with our Iorces in the subMuJation oI this
Fremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now.”
   “Get  him away Irom them. Say I wish to Tuestion him.”
   “II  they demur?”
   “They  will  not iI you handle it correctly.”
   NeIud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”

262
   “The  man must die,” the Baron rumbled. “He tried to helS my enemies.”
   NeIud shiIted Irom one Ioot to the other.
   “Well?”
   “M’Lord,   the Sardaukar have… two Sersons in custody who miJht be oI
interest to you. They’ve cauJht the Duke’s Master oI Assassins.”
   “Hawat? ThuIir  Hawat?”
   “I’ve  seen the caStive myselI, m‘Lord. ’Tis Hawat.”
   “I’d   not’ve believed it Sossible!”
   “They  say he was knocked out by a stunner, m’Lord. In the desert where
he couldn’t use his shield. He’s virtually unharmed. II we can Jet our hands
on him, he’ll Srovide Jreat sSort.”
   “This  is a Mentat you sSeak oI,” the Baron Jrowled. “One doesn’t waste
a Mentat. Has he sSoken? What does he say oI his deIeat? Could he know
the e[tent oI … but no.”
   “He  has sSoken only enouJh, m’Lord, to  reveal his belieI that the Lady
Jessica was his betrayer.”
   “Ah-h-h-h-h.”
   The Baron sank back, thinkinJ;  then: “You’re sure? It’s the Lady Jessica
who attracts his anJer?”
   “He  said it in my Sresence, m’Lord.”
   “Let  him think she’s alive, then.”
   “But,  m’Lord—”
   “Be  Tuiet. I  wish Hawat  treated kindly. He must be told  nothinJ  oI the
late Doctor  Yueh, his true betrayer. Let  it  be said that  Doctor Yueh died
deIendinJ his Duke. In a way, this may even be true. We will, instead, Ieed
his susSicions aJainst the Lady Jessica.”
   “M‘Lord,   I don’t—”
   “The   way   to  control   and  direct   a  Mentat,  NeIud,   is   throuJh  his
inIormation. False inIormation—Ialse results.”
   “Yes, m’Lord,  but …”
   “Is  Hawat hunJry? Thirsty?”
   “M’Lord,   Hawat’s still in  the hands oI the Sardaukar!”
   “Yes.   Indeed,  yes.  But   the  Sardaukar  will    be  as  an[ious   to   Jet
inIormation  Irom  Hawat  as I  am. I’ve   noticed a  thinJ  about our  allies,
NeIud.  They’re  not  very   devious…  Solitically.  I   do  believe  this  is  a
deliberate thinJ; the EmSeror wants it  that way. Yes. I  do believe it.  You

263
will   remind   the  Sardaukar  commander  oI   my   renown   at  obtaininJ
inIormation Irom reluctant subMects.”
   NeIud looked unhaSSy. “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “You  will   tell  the  Sardaukar commander that I  wish  to Tuestion both
Hawat and this Kynes at the same time, SlayinJ one oII  aJainst the other.
He can understand that much, I think.”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “And  once we have them in our hands….” The Baron nodded.
   “M’Lord,   the  Sardaukar will  want an observer with  you durinJ  any …
TuestioninJ.”
   “I’m    sure we  can Sroduce an  emerJency to  draw  oII  any  unwanted
observers, NeIud.”
   “I  understand, m’Lord. That’s when Kynes can have his accident.”
   “Both  Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, NeIud. But only Kynes
will have a real accident. It’s Hawat I want. Yes. Ah, yes.”
   NeIud  blinked,  swallowed.  He  aSSeared about to ask a Tuestion,  but
remained silent.
   “Hawat  will  be Jiven both Iood and drink,” the Baron said. “Treated with
kindness, with  symSathy. In  his  water  you will   administer  the  residual
Soison develoSed by the  late Piter  de Vries.  And  you  will   see that the
antidote becomes a reJular Sart oI Hawat’s diet Irom this Soint on … unless
I say otherwise.”
   “The  antidote, yes.” NeIud shook his head. “But—”
   “Don’t   be dense, NeIud. The Duke  almost killed  me with  that  Soison-
caSsule tooth. The Jas he e[haled  into  my  Sresence deSrived me oI my
most valuable Mentat, Piter. I need a reSlacement.”
   “Hawat?”
   “Hawat.”
   “But—”
   “You’re  JoinJ  to say Hawat’s comSletely loyal to the Atreides. True, but
the Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he’s not to
blame Ior  the Duke’s  demise. It was  all the  doinJ  oI that  Bene Gesserit
witch.  He  had  an  inIerior   master, one  whose reason  was clouded  by
emotion. Mentats admire the ability   to calculate without  emotion, NeIud.
We will woo the Iormidable ThuIir Hawat.”
   “Woo  him. Yes, m’Lord.”

264
   “Hawat,  unIortunately, had a master whose resources were Soor, one who
could not  elevate a Mentat  to the  sublime Seaks oI reasoninJ that  are a
Mentat’s riJht. Hawat will   see a certain element oI truth in this. The Duke
couldn’t  aIIord  the most  eIIicient  sSies to  Srovide  his Mentat  with   the
reTuired inIormation.”  The Baron  stared at NeIud. “Let  us never deceive
ourselves, NeIud.  The  truth  is  a SowerIul  weaSon. We  know  how  we
overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth.”
   “With  wealth. Yes, m’Lord.”
   “We  will   woo  Hawat,”  the  Baron  said. “We  will   hide  him  Irom  the
Sardaukar. And we will hold in reserve… the withdrawal oI the antidote Ior
the Soison. There’s no way oI  removinJ the residual Soison. And, NeIud,
Hawat need never susSect. The antidote will not  betray itselI  to a Soison
snooSer. Hawat can scan his  Iood  as he Sleases and detect no  trace oI
Soison.”
   NeIud’s eyes oSened wide with understandinJ.
   “The  absence oI a thinJ,”  the Baron said, “this  can be as deadly as the
presence. The absence oI air, eh? The absence oI water? The absence oI
anythinJ else we’re addicted to.” The Baron nodded. “You understand me,
NeIud?”
   NeIud swallowed. “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “Then   Jet  busy.  Find  the  Sardaukar  commander and  set  thinJs  in
motion.”
   “At  once, m’Lord.”  NeIud bowed, turned, and hurried away.
   Hawat by my side! the Baron thouJht. The Sardaukar will give him to me.
If they suspect anything at all it’s that I wish to destroy the Mentat. And this
suspicion I’ll confirm!  The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all
history, a Mentat trained  to kill,  and they’ll  toss him to me like  some silly
toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.
   The Baron reached beneath a draSery beside his susSensor bed, Sressed a
button to summon his older neShew, Rabban. He sat back, smilinJ.
   And all  the Atreides dead!
   The  stuSid Juard caStain had been riJht,  oI  course. Certainly, nothinJ
survived in the Sath oI a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not  an ornithoSter…
or its occuSants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the riJht
Slaces, the unthinkable e[Senditure to brinJ  overwhelminJ  military  Iorce
down onto one Slanet… all the sly  reSorts tailored Ior the EmSeror’s ears
alone, all the careIul scheminJ were here at last cominJ to Iull Iruition.

265
   Power andfear—fearand power!
   The Baron could see the Sath ahead oI him. One day, a Harkonnen would
be EmSeror. Not himselI, and no sSawn oI his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not
this Rabban he’d  summoned, oI  course. But  Rabban’s younJer  brother,
younJ  Feyd-Rautha. There was  a  sharSness to the boy  that  the  Baron
enMoyed… a Ierocity.
   A  lovely boy, the Baron  thouJht. A year  or two  more—say, by the time
he’s seventeen, I’ll   know for   certain  whether  he’s the  tool  that  House
Harkonnen reTuires to gain the throne.
   “M’Lord   Baron.”
   The man who stood outside the doorIield oI the Baron’s bedchamber was
low  built,  Jross  oI  Iace  and  body, with   the Harkonnen  Saternal line’s
narrow-set eyes and bulJe oI shoulders. There was yet some riJidity in his
Iat, but it  was obvious to  the eye that he’d  come one day to the  Sortable
susSensors Ior carryinJ his e[cess weiJht.
   A   muscle-minded  tank-brain,   the   Baron  thouJht.   No   Mentat,   my
nephew… not  a  Piter  de  Vries, but  perhaps  something more  precisely
devised for the task at hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he’ll  grind over
everything in his path. Oh, how he’ll be hated here on Arrakis!
   “My    dear Rabban,”  the  Baron  said.  He  released the  doorIield,   but
Sointedly keSt his body shield at Iull strenJth, knowinJ that the shimmer oI
it would be visible above the bedside JlowJlobe.
   “You  summoned me,” Rabban said. He steSSed into the room, Ilicked a
Jlance Sast the air disturbance oI the body shield, searched Ior a susSensor
chair, Iound none.
   “Stand closer where I can see you easily,” the Baron said.
   Rabban advanced another steS, thinkinJ that the damnable old man had
deliberately removed all chairs, IorcinJ a visitor to stand.
   “The  Atreides are dead,” the Baron said. “The last oI them. That’s why I
summoned you here to Arrakis. This Slanet is aJain yours.”
   Rabban blinked. “But I  thouJht you were JoinJ to advance Piter de Vries
to the—”
   “Piter,  too, is dead.”
   “Piter?”
   “Piter.”
   The   Baron  reactivated  the  doorIield,   blanked  it  aJainst  all   enerJy
Senetration.

266
   “You  Iinally  tired oI him, eh?” Rabban asked.
   His voice Iell  Ilat and liIeless in the enerJy-blanketed room.
   “I   will   say a  thinJ  to  you  Must this once,” the  Baron rumbled.  “You
insinuate that I obliterated Piter as one obliterates a triIle.” He  snaSSed Iat
IinJers. “Just  like  that,  eh? I  am  not  so stuSid,  NeShew. I  will  take  it
unkindly iI ever aJain you suJJest by word or action that I am so stuSid.”
   Fear showed in the sTuintinJ  oI Rabban’s eyes. He knew within  certain
limits how  Iar the old Baron would  Jo aJainst Iamily.  Seldom to the Soint
oI death unless there were outraJeous SroIit or Srovocation in it. But Iamily
Sunishments could be SainIul.
   “ForJive  me, m’Lord  Baron,” Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much
to hide his own anJer as to show subservience.
   “You  do not Iool me, Rabban,” the Baron said.
   Rabban keSt his eyes lowered, swallowed.
   “I  make a Soint,”  the Baron said. “Never obliterate a man unthinkinJly,
the way an entire IieI miJht do it  throuJh some due process of law. Always
do it Ior an overridinJ SurSose—and know your purpose!”
   AnJer  sSoke in Rabban: “But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! I saw his
body beinJ carried out as I arrived last niJht.”
   Rabban stared at his  uncle, suddenly IriJhtened  by the  sound oI those
words.
   But  the Baron smiled. “I’m   very  careIul about danJerous weaSons,” he
said. “Doctor Yueh was a traitor.  He Jave me the Duke.”  StrenJth Soured
into the Baron’s voice. “I   suborned a doctor oI the Suk School! The Inner
School! You  hear, boy? But  that’s a  wild  sort  oI weaSon to  leave lyinJ
about. I didn’t obliterate him casually.”
   “Does the EmSeror know you suborned a Suk doctor?”
   This  was a penetrating Tuestion, the Baron  thouJht. Have  I misjudged
this nephew?
   “The  EmSeror doesn’t know it  yet,” the Baron  said. “But his  Sardaukar
are sure to reSort it to him. BeIore that haSSens, thouJh, I’ll have my own
reSort in his hands throuJh CHOAM ComSany channels. I will e[Slain that
I luckily  discovered a  doctor who  Sretended to the conditioninJ.  A  Ialse
doctor, you  understand? Since everyone knows  you  cannot counter  the
conditioninJ oI a Suk School, this will be acceSted.”
   “Ah-h-h,  I see,” Rabban murmured.

267
   And  the Baron thouJht: Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how
vital it  is that this remain secret. The Baron suddenly wondered at himselI.
Why did I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine—the nephew
I must use and discard? The Baron Ielt anJer at himselI. He Ielt betrayed.
   “It  must be keSt secret,” Rabban said. “I understand.”
   The  Baron siJhed. “I  Jive  you  diIIerent instructions  about Arrakis  this
time, NeShew. When last you  ruled this  Slace, I held  you in  stronJ rein.
This time, I have only one reTuirement.”
   “M’Lord?”
   “Income.”
   “Income?”
   “Have  you any idea, Rabban, how much we sSent to brinJ such military
Iorce to bear on the  Atreides? Do you  have even the Iirst inklinJ   oI how
much the Guild charJes Ior military transSort?”
   “E[Sensive,  eh?”
   “E[Sensive!”
   The  Baron shot a Iat  arm toward  Rabban. “II  you  sTueeze Arrakis Ior
every cent it can Jive us Ior si[ty years, you’ll Must barely reSay us!”
   Rabban oSened his mouth, closed it without sSeakinJ.
   “E[Sensive,”   the  Baron  sneered. “The damnable  Guild  monoSoly on
sSace would’ve ruined us iI I hadn’t Slanned Ior this e[Sense lonJ aJo. You
should know, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt oI it. We even Said Ior
transSort oI the Sardaukar.”
   And  not Ior the Iirst  time, the Baron wondered iI there ever would come
a day  when  the  Guild  miJht   be circumvented.  They  were  insidious—
bleedinJ oII Must enouJh to keeS the host Irom obMectinJ until they had you
in their Iist where they could Iorce you to Say and Say and Say.
   Always,  the  e[orbitant  demands rode uSon military  ventures. “Hazard
rates,” the oily Guild aJents e[Slained. And Ior every aJent you manaJed to
insert as a watchdoJ in the Guild  Bank structure, they Sut two aJents into
your system.
   Insufferable!
   “Income  then,” Rabban said.
   The Baron lowered his arm, made a Iist. “You must sTueeze.”
   “And  I may do anythinJ I wish as lonJ as I sTueeze?”
   “AnythinJ.”
   “The  cannons you brouJht,” Rabban said. “Could I—”

268
   “I’m   removinJ them,” the Baron said.
   “But  you—”
   “You  won’t  need such toys. They were a sSecial innovation and are now
useless. We need the metal. They cannot Jo aJainst a shield, Rabban. They
were merely the une[Sected. It was Sredictable that the Duke’s men would
retreat into cliII caves on this abominable Slanet. Our cannon merely sealed
them in.”
   “The  Fremen don’t use shields.”
   “You  may keeS some lasJuns iI you wish.”
   “Yes, m’Lord.  And I have a Iree hand.”
   “As  lonJ as you sTueeze.”
   Rabban’s smile was JloatinJ. “I understand SerIectly, m’Lord.”
   “You  understand nothinJ SerIectly,” the Baron Jrowled. “Let us have that
clear at the outset. What you do understand is how to carry out my orders.
Has it occurred to you, neShew, that there are at least Iive million  Sersons
on this Slanet?”
   “Does  m‘Lord  IorJet  that  I was  his reJent-siridar  here beIore? And iI
m’Lord  will  IorJive  me, his estimate may be low.  It’s  diIIicult  to  count a
SoSulation scattered amonJ sinks and Sans the  way they  are here. And
when you consider the Fremen oI—”
   “The  Fremen aren’t worth considerinJ!”
   “ForJive  me, m’Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise.”
   The Baron hesitated, starinJ at his neShew. “You know somethinJ?”
   “M’Lord   had retired when I arrived last niJht.  I …ah, took the liberty  oI
contactinJ some oI my lieutenants Irom… ah, beIore. They’ve been actinJ
as Juides to the  Sardaukar. They reSort that a Fremen band ambushed a
Sardaukar Iorce somewhere southeast oI here and wiSed it out.”
   “WiSed out a Sardaukar Iorce?”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “ImSossible!”
   Rabban shruJJed.
   “Fremen deIeatinJ Sardaukar,” the Baron sneered.
   “I   reSeat only what was  reSorted to me,”  Rabban said. “It  is said  this
Fremen Iorce already had caStured the Duke’s redoubtable ThuIir Hawat.”
   “Ah-h-h-h-h-h.”
   The Baron nodded, smilinJ.

269
   “I  believe the reSort,” Rabban said. “You’ve no idea what a Sroblem the
Fremen were.”
   “PerhaSs, but these weren’t Fremen your lieutenants saw. They must’ve
been Atreides men trained by Hawat and disJuised as Fremen. It’s the only
Sossible answer.”
   AJain,  Rabban shruJJed. “Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen.
The Sardaukar already have launched a SroJram to wiSe out all Fremen.”
   “Good!”
   “But—”
   “It’ll    keeS the Sardaukar occuSied. And we’ll soon have Hawat. I know
it! I  can Ieel it!  Ah,  this has been a day! The Sardaukar oII huntinJ a Iew
useless desert bands while we Jet the real Srize!”
   “M’Lord….”     Rabban hesitated,  IrowninJ.   “I’ve   always  Ielt  that  we
underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in—”
   “IJnore  them,  boy! They’re  rabble. It’s  the SoSulous towns, cities, and
villaJes that concern us. A Jreat many SeoSle there, eh?”
   “A  Jreat many, m’Lord.”
   “They  worry me, Rabban.”
   “Worry  you?”
   “Oh  … ninety Ser cent oI them are oI no concern. But there are always a
Iew…  Houses Minor   and so  on,  SeoSle oI  ambition  who  miJht  try   a
danJerous thinJ. II one oI  them should Jet oII  Arrakis with  an unSleasant
story about what haSSened here, I’d be most disSleased. Have you any idea
how disSleased I’d be?”
   Rabban swallowed.
   “You  must take immediate measures to hold a hostaJe Irom each House
Minor,”  the Baron said. “As Iar  as anyone oII Arrakis must learn, this was
straiJhtIorward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no Sart in it, you
understand? The Duke was oIIered the usual Tuarter and e[ile, but he died
in an unIortunate accident beIore he could acceSt. He was about to acceSt,
thouJh. That is the story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it
must be lauJhed at.”
   “As  the EmSeror wishes it,” Rabban said.
   “As  the EmSeror wishes it.”
   “What  about the smuJJlers?”
   “No    one  believes  smuJJlers,  Rabban. They   are  tolerated,  but  not
believed. At any rate, you’ll be sSreadinJ some bribes in that Tuarter… and

270
takinJ other measures which I’m sure you can think oI.”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “Two   thinJs Irom  Arrakis,  then, Rabban: income  and a merciless Iist.
You must show no  mercy here. Think  oI  these clods as what they  are—
slaves envious oI their masters and waitinJ  only the  oSSortunity to rebel.
Not the sliJhtest vestiJe oI Sity or mercy must you show them.”
   “Can one e[terminate an entire Slanet?” Rabban asked.
   “E[terminate?”   SurSrise showed in the swiIt turninJ oI the Baron’s head.
“Who said anythinJ about e[terminatinJ?”
   “Well,  I Sresumed you were JoinJ to brinJ in new stock and—”
   “I   said sTueeze, NeShew, not e[terminate. Don’t waste the  SoSulation,
merely drive  them into  utter submission. You  must be the carnivore,  my
boy.” He smiled,  a baby’s e[Sression in the dimSle-Iat  Iace. “A  carnivore
never stoSs. Show no mercy. Never  stoS. Mercy  is a  chimera. It  can be
deIeated by the stomach rumblinJ its hunJer, by the throat cryinJ its thirst.
You must be  always hunJry  and thirsty.”  The Baron  caressed his bulJes
beneath the susSensors. “Like me.”
   “I  see, m’Lord.”
   Rabban swunJ his Jaze leIt and riJht.
   “It’s  all clear then, NeShew?”
   “E[ceSt  Ior one thinJ, Uncle: the SlanetoloJist, Kynes.”
   “Ah,  yes, Kynes.”
   “He’s  the EmSeror’s man, m’Lord.  He  can come and Jo as he Sleases.
And he’s very close to the Fremen … married one.”
   “Kynes  will  be dead by tomorrow’s niJhtIall.”
   “That’s  danJerous work, Uncle, killinJ an ImSerial servant.”
   “How    do  you   think  I’ve    come  this  Iar   this  Tuickly?”    the  Baron
demanded. His   voice  was  low,   charJed  with   unsSeakable adMectives.
“Besides, you need never have Ieared Kynes would leave Arrakis.  You’re
IorJettinJ that he’s addicted to the sSice.”
   “OI  course!”
   “Those  who know  will  do nothinJ  to endanJer their suSSly,” the Baron
said. “Kynes certainly must know.”
   “I  IorJot,”  Rabban said.
   They stared at each other in silence.
   Presently, the Baron said: “Incidentally,  you  will  make my  own suSSly
one oI your  Iirst  concerns. I’ve Tuite a stockSile oI  Srivate stuII,  but that

271
suicide raid by the Duke’s men Jot most oI what we’d stored Ior sale.”
   Rabban nodded. “Yes, m’Lord.”
   The  Baron  briJhtened.  “Now,  tomorrow  morninJ,  you  will   assemble
what remains oI  orJanization here and you’ll   say to them:  ‘Our  Sublime
Padishah EmSeror has charJed me to take Sossession oI this Slanet and end
all disSute.’ ”
   “I  understand, m’Lord.”
   “This  time, I’m  sure you do. We will  discuss it in more detail tomorrow.
Now, leave me to Iinish my sleeS.”
   The Baron deactivated his doorIield, watched his neShew out oI siJht.
   A tank-brain,  the Baron thouJht. Muscle-minded tank-brain. They will be
bloody pulp here when he’s through with them. Then, when I send in Feyd-
Rautha to take the load off them, they’ll cheer their rescuer. Beloved Feyd-
Rautha. Benign Feyd-Rautha, the compassionate one who saves them from
a beast. Feyd-Rautha, a man to follow  and die for.  The boy will  know by
that time how to oppress with impunity. I’m sure he’s the one we need. He’ll
learn. And such a lovely body. Really a lovely boy.

272
        At the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.

  As PAUL IouJht  the ‘thoSter’s  controls,  he  Jrew  aware that he  was sortinJ
out   the   interwoven    storm    Iorces,   his    more   than   Mentat    awareness
comSutinJ   on   the   basis   oI   Iractional    minutiae.    He   Ielt    dust   Ironts,
billowinJs,   mi[inJs   oI turbulence,  an occasional  vorte[.
    The  cabin  interior   was  an anJry   bo[   liJhted   by  the  Jreen  radiance  oI
instrument  dials.  The tan  Ilow  oI  dust outside  aSSeared Ieatureless, but his
inner sense beJan to see throuJh the curtain.
    I must find  the right  vortex,  he thouJht.
    For  a lonJ  time  now  he  had sensed the  storm’s  Sower  diminishinJ,   but
still  it shook them.  He waited  out another turbulence.
    The vorte[   beJan as an abruSt  billowinJ   that  rattled  the entire  shiS. Paul
deIied all  Iear to bank  the ’thoSter leIt.
    Jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude  Jlobe.
    “Paul!”   she screamed.
    The vorte[   turned them,  twistinJ,   tiSSinJ. It  liIted  the  ’thoSter like  a chiS
on a  Jeyser,  sSewed them  uS and  out—a   winJed  sSeck  within   a core  oI
windinJ  dust liJhted  by  the second moon.
    Paul  looked   down,   saw  the  dust-deIined   Sillar   oI  hot   wind   that  had
disJorJed  them, saw  the dyinJ  storm  trailinJ   away  like  a dry  river  into  the
desert-moon-Jray  motion   JrowinJ   smaller  and smaller  below   as they rode
the uSdraIt.
    “We’re  out oI  it,”  Jessica whisSered.
    Paul turned  their  craIt  away Irom   the dust  in swooSinJ  rhythm   while  he
scanned the niJht sky.
    “We’ve  Jiven  them the sliS,”  he said.
    Jessica Ielt her  heart SoundinJ.  She Iorced  herselI to  calmness, looked  at
the  diminishinJ    storm.  Her  time   sense said  they  had  ridden   within   that
comSoundinJ  oI  elemental  Iorces  almost  Iour  hours,  but  Sart oI  her  mind
comSuted the SassaJe as a liIetime. She Ielt  reborn.
    It  was  like  the  litany,  she thouJht.   We faced  it   and  did  not  resist.  The
storm passed through  us and around us. It’s  gone, but we remain.

273
   “I   don’t  like  the sound oI  our  winJ  motion,”  Paul  said. “We  suIIered
some damaJe in there.”
   He Ielt  the JratinJ, inMured IliJht throuJh his hands on the controls. They
were out oI  the storm, but still  not  out into  the Iull  view  oI  his Srescient
vision. Yet,  they had escaSed, and Paul sensed himselI tremblinJ  on the
verJe oI a revelation.
   He shivered.
   The sensation was maJnetic and terriIyinJ, and he Iound himselI cauJht
on the Tuestion oI what caused this tremblinJ awareness. Part oI it, he Ielt,
was the sSice-saturated diet oI Arrakis. But he thouJht  Sart oI it  could be
the litany, as thouJh the words had a Sower oI their own.
   “Ishallnotfear…
   Cause and  eIIect:  he was  alive  desSite maliJnant Iorces,  and he  Ielt
himselI  Soised on  a brink   oI  selI-awareness that  could  not  have been
without the litany’s maJic.
   Words Irom  the OranJe Catholic Bible ranJ throuJh his memory: “What
senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?”
   “There’s rock all  around,” Jessica said.
   Paul Iocused on the ’thoSter’s  launchinJ, shook his head to clear it.  He
looked where his mother  Sointed, saw uSliItinJ  rock shaSes black on the
sand ahead and to the riJht. He  Ielt wind  around his  ankles, a stirrinJ  oI
dust in the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more oI the storm’s doinJ.
   “Better  set us down  on sand,” Jessica said. “The winJs  miJht  not take
Iull brake.”
   He  nodded toward  a Slace ahead where sandblasted ridJes liIted  into
moonliJht above the dunes. “I’ll  set us down near those rocks. Check your
saIety harness.”
   She obeyed, thinkinJ: We’ve water and stillsuits. If  we can find food, we
can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do
we can do.
   “Run  Ior those rocks the instant we’re stoSSed,” Paul said. “I’ll  take the
Sack.”
   “Run  Ior….”  She Iell silent, nodded. “Worms.”
   “Our   Iriends, the worms,”  he  corrected her. “They’ll   Jet  this ’thoSter.
There’ll be no evidence oI where we landed.”
   How direct his thinking, she thouJht.
   They Jlided lower…  lower …

274
   There came a rushinJ sense oI motion to their SassaJe—blurred shadows
oI dunes, rocks liItinJ  like islands. The ’thoSter touched a dune toS with a
soIt lurch, skiSSed a sand valley, touched another dune.
   He’s killing   our speed against the sand, Jessica thouJht, and Sermitted
herselI to admire his comSetence.
   “Brace yourselI!”  Paul warned.
   He Sulled back on the winJ brakes, Jently at Iirst, then harder and harder.
He Ielt them cuS the air, their asSect ratio droSSinJ Iaster and Iaster. Wind
screamed throuJh the laSSed coverts and Srimaries oI the winJs’ leaves.
   AbruStly, with  only the Iaintest lurch oI warninJ, the leIt winJ, weakened
by the  storm,  twisted  uSward and  in,  slamminJ  across the side  oI  the
’thoSter. The craIt skidded across a dune toS, twistinJ to the leIt. It tumbled
down the oSSosite Iace to bury its nose in the ne[t dune amid a cascade oI
sand. They lay stoSSed on the broken winJ  side, the riJht  winJ   SointinJ
toward the stars.
   Paul  Merked oII his  saIety harness, hurled  himselI  uSward across his
mother, wrenchinJ the door oSen. Sand Soured around them into the cabin,
brinJinJ a dry smell oI burned Ilint.  He Jrabbed the Sack Irom the rear, saw
that his mother was Iree oI her harness. She steSSed uS onto the side oI the
riJht-hand  seat and  out  onto  the  ’thoSter’s metal  skin.  Paul  Iollowed,
draJJinJ the Sack by its straSs.
   “Run!”  he ordered.
   He  Sointed uS the dune Iace and beyond it where they could see a rock
tower undercut by sandblast winds.
   Jessica leaSed oII the  ’thoSter and ran,  scramblinJ and  slidinJ  uS the
dune. She heard Paul’s SantinJ SroJress behind. They came out onto a sand
ridJe that curved away toward the rocks.
   “Follow  the ridJe,”  Paul ordered. “It’ll be Iaster.”
   They sloJJed toward the rocks, sand JriSSinJ their Ieet.
   A  new sound beJan to imSress itselI on them: a muted whisSer, a hissinJ,
an abrasive slitherinJ.
   “Worm,”  Paul said.
   It  Jrew louder.
   “Faster!”  Paul JasSed.
   The Iirst  rock  shinJle, like a  beach slantinJ Irom the sand, lay no more
than ten meters ahead when they  heard metal crunch and  shatter behind
them.

275
   Paul shiIted his Sack to his riJht  arm, holdinJ it  by the straSs. It slaSSed
his side as he  ran. He  took his  mother’s arm  with  his other  hand. They
scrambled onto  the liItinJ    rock,  uS a  Sebble-littered surIace throuJh  a
twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and JasSinJ in their throats.
   “I  can’t run any Iarther,” Jessica Santed.
   Paul stoSSed, Sressed her into a Jut oI rock, turned and looked down onto
the desert. A  mound-in-motion ran  Sarallel to their  rock  island—moonlit
riSSles, sand waves, a crestinJ burrow almost level  with  Paul’s eyes at a
distance oI about a kilometer. The Ilattened dunes oI its track curved once
—a short looS crossinJ the Satch oI desert where they had abandoned their
wrecked ornithoSter.
   Where the worm had been there was no siJn oI the aircraIt.
   The burrow  mound moved outward into  the desert, coursed back across
its own Sath, TuestinJ.
   “It’s  biJJer  than a Guild sSaceshiS,” Paul whisSered. “I was told worms
Jrew larJe in the deeS desert, but I didn’t realize … how biJ.”
   “Nor  I,”  Jessica breathed.
   AJain,   the thinJ   turned out  away  Irom  the  rocks,  sSed now  with  a
curbinJ  track  toward  the horizon.  They  listened  until  the  sound oI   its
SassaJe was lost in Jentle sand stirrinJs around them.
   Paul took  a deeS breath, looked uS at the moon-Irosted escarSment, and
Tuoted Irom the  Kitab  al-Ibar:  “Travel  by  niJht  and rest in  black  shade
throuJh the day.” He  looked at his  mother. “We still  have a Iew  hours oI
niJht. Can you Jo on?”
   “In  a moment.”
   Paul steSSed out onto the rock shinJle, shouldered the Sack and adMusted
its straSs. He stood a moment with a SaracomSass in his hands.
   “Whenever you’re ready,” he said.
   She  Sushed herselI away  Irom  the  rock,  IeelinJ  her  strenJth  return.
“Which direction?”
   “Where this ridJe  leads.” He Sointed.
   “DeeS into the desert,” she said.
   “The  Fremen desert,” Paul whisSered.
   And  he  Saused, shaken by the  remembered hiJh  relieI  imaJery  oI  a
Srescient vision he had e[Serienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert.
But the set oI the vision had been subtly diIIerent, like an oStical imaJe that
had disaSSeared into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and

276
now Iailed oI SerIect reJistry when SroMected onto the real scene. The vision
aSSeared to have shiIted and aSSroached him Irom a diIIerent anJle while
he remained motionless.
   Idaho was with us in the vision, he remembered. But now Idaho is dead.
   “Do  you see a way to Jo?” Jessica asked, mistakinJ his hesitation.
   “No,”  he said, “But we’ll  Jo anyway.”
   He  settled his shoulders more Iirmly  in  the Sack, struck out uS a sand-
carved channel in the rock. The channel oSened onto a moonlit Iloor oI rock
with benched ledJes climbinJ away to the south.
   Paul headed Ior the Iirst ledJe, clambered onto it. Jessica Iollowed.
   She noted Sresently how their SassaJe became a matter oI the immediate
and Sarticular—the sand  Sockets between rocks where  their  steSs were
slowed, the  wind-carved ridJe  that  cut  their  hands, the obstruction  that
Iorced a  choice:  Go  over  or  Jo  around? The  terrain  enIorced its  own
rhythms. They sSoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices
oI their e[ertion.
   “CareIul  here—this ledJe is sliSSery with sand.”
   “Watch you don’t  hit your head aJainst this overhanJ.”
   “Stay   below  this  ridJe;  the  moon’s at  our  backs and  it’d   show  our
movement to anyone out there.”
   Paul stoSSed in a biJht oI rock, leaned the Sack aJainst a narrow ledJe.
   Jessica leaned beside him, thankIul  Ior  the moment oI  rest. She heard
Paul SullinJ at his  stillsuit tube, siSSed her own reclaimed water. It tasted
brackish, and  she  remembered the  waters oI   Caladan—a tall  Iountain
enclosinJ a curve oI  sky, such a  richness oI moisture  that it  hadn’t been
noticed Ior itselI  … only  Ior its shaSe, or its reIlection, or its  sound as she
stoSSed beside it.
   To stop, she thouJht. To rest… truly rest.
   It  occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stoS, iI only Ior a moment.
There was no mercy where there could be no stoSSinJ.
   Paul  Sushed away  Irom  the  rock  ledJe, turned,  and  climbed  over a
sloSinJ surIace. Jessica Iollowed with a siJh.
   They  slid  down  onto a  wide  shelI that  led  around a sheer rock  Iace.
AJain, they Iell  into the disMointed rhythm oI movement across this broken
land.
   Jessica Ielt  that  the niJht   was dominated by  deJrees oI  smallness in
substances beneath their Ieet and hands—boulders or Sea Jravel or Ilaked

277
rock or Sea sand or sand itselI or Jrit or dust or Jossamer Sowder.
   The Sowder cloJJed nose Iilters and had to be blown  out. Pea sand and
Sea Jravel rolled on a hard surIace and could sSill the unwary. Rock Ilakes
cut.
   And  the omniSresent sand Satches draJJed aJainst their Ieet.
   Paul  stoSSed abruStly  on  a  rock  shelI,  steadied  his  mother  as she
stumbled into him.
   He was SointinJ leIt  and she looked alonJ his arm to see that they stood
atoS a cliII   with   the desert stretched out  like  a  static  ocean some two
hundred meters below. It lay there Iull  oI  moon-silvered waves—shadows
oI anJles that laSsed into curves and, in  the distance, liIted  to the misted
Jray blur oI another escarSment.
   “OSen desert,” she said.
   “A  wide Slace to cross,” Paul said, and his voice was muIIled by the Iilter
traS across his Iace.
   Jessica Jlanced leIt and riJht—nothinJ but sand below.
   Paul stared straiJht ahead across the oSen dunes, watchinJ the movement
oI shadows in the moon’s SassaJe. “About three or Iour kilometers across,”
he said.
   “Worms,”  she said.
   “Sure to be.”
   She Iocused on  her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled  her senses.
“Shall we rest and eat?”
   Paul  sliSSed out oI  the  Sack, sat down  and leaned aJainst it.   Jessica
suSSorted herselI by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside
him. She Ielt  Paul turn as she settled herselI, heard him scrabblinJ in  the
Sack.
   “Here,”  he said.
   His  hand Ielt dry aJainst hers as he Sressed two enerJy caSsules into her
Salm.
   She swallowed them with a JrudJinJ sSit oI water Irom her stillsuit tube.
   “Drink   all  your  water,” Paul  said. “A[iom:   the  best Slace to conserve
your water is in your  body. It keeSs your enerJy uS. You’re stronJer. Trust
your stillsuit.”
   She obeyed, drained her catchSockets, IeelinJ enerJy return. She thouJht
then how SeaceIul it  was here in this  moment oI  their tiredness, and she

278
recalled once hearinJ the minstrel-warrior   Gurney Halleck  say, “Better  a
dry morsel and Tuietness therewith than a house Iull oI sacriIice and striIe.”
   Jessica reSeated the words to Paul.
   “That  was Gurney,” he said.
   She cauJht the tone oI his voice, the way  he sSoke as oI someone dead,
thouJht: And well  poor  Gurney might be dead. The  Atreides Iorces were
either dead or caStive or lost like themselves in this waterless void.
   “Gurney  always had the riJht Tuotation,” Paul said. “I can hear him now:
‘And  I  will   make the  rivers dry,  and sell  the land  into  the hand  oI  the
wicked: and I will  make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand
oI stranJers.’ ”
   Jessica closed her eyes, Iound herselI moved close to tears by the Sathos
in her son’s voice.
   Presently, Paul said: “How do you … Ieel?”
   She recoJnized  that his  Tuestion was directed  at her  SreJnancy, said:
“Your sister won’t  be born Ior  many months yet. I  still  Ieel …  Shysically
adeTuate.”
   And   she thouJht:  How  stiffly  formal  I   speak to  my own  son!  Then,
because it was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within Ior the answer to such
an oddity, she searched and Iound the source oI her Iormality: I’m afraid of
my son; Ifearhis strangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he
may tell me.
   Paul  Sulled his hood  down over  his eyes, listened  to the  buJ-hustlinJ
sounds oI the niJht. His lunJs were charJed with his own silence. His nose
itched. He rubbed it, removed the Iilter and Jrew conscious oI the rich smell
oI cinnamon.
   “There’s melanJe sSice nearby,” he said.
   An  eider wind Ieathered Paul’s cheeks, ruIIled the Iolds oI his burnoose.
But  this  wind  carried  no  threat  oI  storm;  already  he  could  sense the
diIIerence.
   “Dawn  soon,” he said.
   Jessica nodded.
   “There’s  a  way to  Jet  saIely across that  oSen sand,” Paul said.  “The
Fremen do it. ”
   “The  worms?”
   “II  we were to Slant a thumSer Irom our Fremkit back in the rocks here,”
Paul said. “It’d keeS a worm occuSied Ior a time.”

279
   She Jlanced at the stretch oI  moonliJhted desert between them and the
other escarSment. “Four kilometers worth oI time?”
   “PerhaSs. And iI  we crossed there makinJ only natural sounds, the kind
that don’t attract the worms….”
   Paul studied the oSen desert, TuestinJ in his Srescient memory, SrobinJ
the mysterious  allusions  to  thumSers and maker  hooks  in  the  Fremkit
manual that had come with their  escaSe Sack. He Iound it odd that all he
sensed was Servasive terror at thouJht oI the worms. He knew as thouJh it
lay Must at the edJe oI his awareness that the worms were to be resSected
and not Ieared … iI … iI….
   He shook his head.
   “It’d   have to be sounds without rhythm,” Jessica said.
   “What?  Oh. Yes. II we broke our steSs … the sand itselI must shiIt down
at times. Worms  can’t investiJate  every little  sound. We  should be Iully
rested beIore we try it, thouJh.”
   He looked across at that other rock wall, seeinJ the SassaJe oI time in the
vertical moonshadows there. “It’ll be dawn within the hour.”
   “Where’ll   we sSend the day?” she asked.
   Paul turned leIt, Sointed. “The cliII curves back north over there. You can
see by the way it’s wind-cut that’s the windward Iace. There’ll be crevasses
there, deeS ones.”
   “Had  we better Jet started?” she asked.
   He  stood, helSed her to  her Ieet. “Are   you rested enouJh Ior  a  climb
down? I  want  to  Jet as close  as Sossible to  the desert Iloor  beIore  we
camS.”
   “EnouJh.”  She nodded Ior him to lead the way.
   He hesitated, then liIted the Sack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned
alonJ the cliII.
   If  only we had suspensors, Jessica thought. It’d be such a simple matter
to jump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in
the open desert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.
   They came to a series oI shelves droSSinJ down and, beyond them, saw a
Iissure with its ledJe outlined by moonshadow leadinJ alonJ the vestibule.
   Paul led  the way down,  movinJ cautiously  but hurryinJ  because it was
obvious the moonliJht could not last much lonJer. They wound down into a
world oI  deeSer and deeSer shadows. Hints oI rock shaSe climbed to the

280
stars around them. The Iissure narrowed to some ten meters’ width at  the
brink oI a dim Jray sandsloSe that slanted downward into darkness.
   “Can we Jo down?” Jessica whisSered.
   “I  think so.”
   He tested the surIace with one Ioot.
   “We can slide down,” he said. “I’ll  Jo Iirst. Wait until  you hear me stoS.”
   “CareIul,”  she said.
   He steSSed onto the sloSe and slid and sliSSed down its soIt surIace onto
an almost level Iloor  oI Sacked sand. The Slace was deeS within the rock
walls.
   There came the sound oI sand slidinJ behind him. He tried to see uS the
sloSe in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed
away to silence.
   “Mother?”  he said.
   There was no answer.
   “Mother?”
   He  droSSed the Sack, hurled himselI uS the sloSe, scramblinJ, diJJinJ,
throwinJ sand like  a wild  man. “Mother!”   he JasSed. “Mother, where are
you?”
   Another cascade oI sand sweSt down on him, buryinJ him to the hiSs. He
wrenched himselI out oI it.
   She’s been caught in the  sandslide, he thought. Buried in  it.  I  must be
calm and  work this  out  carefully. She won’t  smother immediately. She’ll
compose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows
I’ll  dig for her.
   In  the  Bene Gesserit way she had  tauJht him,  Paul stilled  the  savaJe
beatinJ oI his heart, set his mind as a blank slate uSon which the Sast Iew
moments could write themselves. Every Sartial shiIt and twist  oI the slide
reSlayed itselI  in  his   menory, movinJ   with  an  interior   stateliness that
contrasted with  the Iractional  second oI  real  time  reTuired Ior  the  total
recall.
   Presently, Paul moved slantwise uS the sloSe, SrobinJ cautiously until he
Iound the wall  oI the  Iissure, an outcurve oI rock  there. He beJan to diJ,
movinJ the sand with  care not to dislodJe another slide. A Siece oI Iabric
came under his hands. He Iollowed it, Iound an arm. Gently, he traced the
arm, e[Sosed her Iace.
   “Do  you hear me?” he whisSered.

281
   No answer.
   He  duJ Iaster, Ireed her shoulders. She was limS beneath his hands, but
he detected a slow heartbeat.
   Bindu suspension, he told himselI.
   He   cleared the  sand  away  to  her  waist,  draSed her  arms  over  his
shoulders and Sulled downsloSe, slowly at Iirst, then draJJinJ her as Iast as
he could, IeelinJ the sand Jive way above. Faster and Iaster he Sulled her,
JasSinJ with  the eIIort,  IiJhtinJ  to  keeS his balance. He was  out on  the
hard-Sacked Iloor oI  the  Iissure then,  swinJinJ  her  to his  shoulder and
breakinJ into  a staJJerinJ run  as the entire sandsloSe came down with a
loud hiss that echoed and was maJniIied within the rock walls.
   He  stoSSed at the end oI the Iissure where it looked out on the desert’s
marchinJ dunes some thirty  meters below. Gently, he  lowered her to  the
sand, uttered the word to brinJ her out oI the cataleSsis.
   She awakened slowly, takinJ deeSer and deeSer breaths.
   “I  knew you’d Iind  me,” she whisSered.
   He looked back uS the Iissure. “It miJht have been kinder iI I hadn’t.”
   “Paul!”
   “I  lost the Sack,” he said. “It’s buried under a hundred tons oI sand … at
least.”
   “EverythinJ?”
   “The  sSare water, the stilltent—everythinJ   that counts.”  He touched a
Socket. “I still have the SaracomSass.” He Iumbled at the waist sash. “KniIe
and binoculars. We can Jet a Jood look around the Slace where we’ll die.”
   In  that  instant, the sun liIted  above the  horizon somewhere to the  leIt
beyond the end oI the Iissure. Colors blinked  in  the sand out on the oSen
desert. A chorus oI birds held Iorth  their sonJs Irom hidden Slaces amonJ
the rocks.
   But  Jessica had eyes only Ior the desSair in Paul’s Iace. She edJed her
voice with scorn, said: “Is this the way you were tauJht?”
   “Don’t   you understand?” he asked. “EverythinJ   we need to survive  in
this Slace is under that sand.”
   “You  Iound me,” she said, and now her voice was soIt, reasonable.
   Paul sTuatted back on his heels.
   Presently, he looked uS the Iissure at the new sloSe, studyinJ it, markinJ
the looseness oI the sand.

282
   “II  we could immobilize  a small area oI that sloSe and the uSSer Iace oI a
hole duJ into the  sand, we miJht be able to Sut down a shaIt to  the Sack.
Water miJht do it,  but we  don’t have enouJh water Ior….”   He broke oII,
then: “Foam.”
   Jessica held herselI to  stillness lest she disturb the hySerIunctioninJ  oI
his mind.
   Paul looked out  at the oSen dunes, searchinJ with his nostrils as well as
his eyes, IindinJ the direction and then centerinJ his attention on a darkened
Satch oI sand below them.
   “SSice,”   he   said.  “Its    essence—hiJhly  alkaline.   And   I   have  the
SaracomSass. Its Sower Sack is acid-base.”
   Jessica sat uS straiJht aJainst the rock.
   Paul  iJnored  her,  leaSed to   his  Ieet,  and was  oII   down  the  wind-
comSacted surIace that sSilled Irom the end oI  the Iissure to  the desert’s
Iloor.
   She watched the way he walked, breakinJ his stride—steS … Sause, steS-
steS … slide … Sause …
   There was no rhythm  to it  that miJht tell  a maraudinJ worm  somethinJ
not oI the desert moved here.
   Paul reached the sSice Satch, shoveled a mound oI it into  a Iold  oI  his
robe, returned to the Iissure. He sSilled the sSice onto the sand in Iront oI
Jessica, sTuatted and beJan dismantlinJ the SaracomSass, usinJ the Soint oI
his kniIe.  The  comSass Iace came oII. He  removed his sash, sSread the
comSass Sarts on it, liIted out the Sower Sack. The dial mechanism came
out ne[t, leavinJ an emSty dished comSartment in the instrument.
   “You’ll   need water,” Jessica said.
   Paul took the catchtube Irom his neck, sucked uS a mouthIul, e[Selled it
into the dished comSartment.
   If  this fails, that’s water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won’t matter then,
anyway.
   With  his kniIe, Paul cut oSen the Sower Sack, sSilled its crystals into the
water. They Ioamed sliJhtly, subsided.
   Jessica’s eyes cauJht motion above them. She looked uS to see a line oI
hawks alonJ the rim oI the Iissure. They Serched there starinJ down at the
oSen water.
   Great Mother!  she thought. They can sense water even at that distance!

283
   Paul had the cover back on the SaracomSass, leavinJ oII the reset button
which Jave a small hole into the liTuid.  TakinJ the reworked instrument in
one hand, a handIul oI  sSice in the other, Paul  went back uS the Iissure,
studyinJ the lay oI  the sloSe. His robe billowed Jently  without the sash to
hold it. He waded Sart way uS the sloSe, kickinJ oII the sand rivulets, sSurts
oI dust.
   Presently, he stoSSed, Sressed a Sinch oI the sSice into the SaracomSass,
shook the instrument case.
   Green Ioam boiled out oI  the hole where the reset button had been. Paul
aimed it at the sloSe, sSread a low dike there, beJan kickinJ away the sand
beneath it, immobilizinJ the oSened Iace with more Ioam.
   Jessica moved to a Sosition below him, called out: “May I helS?”
   “Come  uS and diJ,” he said. “We’ve about three meters to Jo. It’s JoinJ
to be  a near thinJ.”   As  he sSoke, the Ioam  stoSSed billowinJ  Irom  the
instrument.
   “Quickly,”   Paul said. “No tellinJ how lonJ this Ioam will  hold the sand.”
   Jessica scrambled uS beside Paul as he siIted another Sinch oI sSice into
the hole, shook the SaracomSass case. AJain, Ioam boiled Irom it.
   As Paul directed the Ioam barrier, Jessica duJ with her hands, hurlinJ the
sand down the sloSe. “How deeS?” she Santed.
   “About  three meters,” he said. “And I can only aSSro[imate the Sosition.
We may have to widen this hole.” He moved a steS aside, sliSSinJ in loose
sand. “Slant your diJJinJ backward. Don’t Jo straiJht down.”
   Jessica obeyed.
   Slowly,  the hole went down, reachinJ a level  even with the Iloor  oI  the
basin and still no siJn oI the Sack.
   Could   I  have  miscalculated?  Paul  asked himselI.  I’m   the  one  that
panicked originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?
   He looked at the SaracomSass. Less than two ounces oI the acid inIusion
remained.
   Jessica straiJhtened in the hole, rubbed a Ioam-stained hand across her
cheek. Her eyes met Paul’s.
   “The  uSSer Iace,” Paul said. “Gently, now.”  He added another Sinch oI
sSice to the container, sent the Ioam boilinJ around Jessica’s hands as she
beJan cuttinJ a vertical Iace in  the uSSer slant oI the hole. On the second
Sass, her hands encountered somethinJ hard. Slowly,  she  worked out  a
lenJth oI straS with a Slastic buckle.

284
   “Don’t   move  any more  oI  it,”   Paul said and  his voice  was  almost a
whisSer.
   “We’re  out oI Ioam.”
   Jessica held the straS in one hand, looked uS at him.
   Paul threw the emSty SaracomSass down onto the Iloor oI the basin, said:
“Give me  your other hand. Now  listen careIully. I’m   JoinJ to  Sull you to
the side and downhill. Don’t  let Jo oI  that straS. We won’t Jet much more
sSill Irom the toS. This sloSe has stabilized itselI. All  I’m JoinJ  to aim Ior
is to keeS your head Iree oI the sand. Once that hole’s Iilled, we can diJ you
out and Sull uS the Sack.”
   “I  understand,” she said.
   “Ready?”
   “Ready.”  She tensed her IinJers on the straS.
   With  one surJe, Paul had her halI out oI the hole, holdinJ her head uS as
the Ioam barrier Jave way  and sand sSilled down. When it  had subsided,
Jessica remained buried to the waist, her leIt arm and shoulder still  under
the sand, her chin Srotected on a Iold  oI Paul’s robe. Her  shoulder ached
Irom the strain Sut on it.
   “I  still  have the straS,” she said.
   Slowly,  Paul worked his  hand into the sand beside her, Iound the straS.
“ToJether,” he said. “Steady Sressure. We mustn’t break it.”
   More  sand sSilled down  as they  worked the  Sack uS. When the straS
cleared the surIace, Paul stoSSed, Ireed his mother Irom the sand. ToJether
then they Sulled the Sack downsloSe and out oI its traS.
   In  a Iew minutes they stood on the Iloor  oI  the Iissure holdinJ the Sack
between them.
   Paul looked  at his mother. Foam  strained her Iace, her robe. Sand was
caked to her where the Ioam had dried. She looked as thouJh she had been
a tarJet Ior balls oI wet, Jreen sand.
   “You  look a mess,” he said.
   “You’re  not so Sretty yourselI,” she said.
   They started to lauJh, then sobered.
   “That  shouldn’t have haSSened,” Paul said. “I was careless.”
   She shruJJed, IeelinJ caked sand Iall away Irom her robe.
   “I’ll   Sut uS the tent,” he said. “Better sliS oII that robe and shake it out.”
He turned away, takinJ the Sack.
   Jessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.

285
   “There’s  anchor holes in  the rock,”  Paul  said. “Someone’s tented here
beIore.”
   Why not? she thouJht as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely Slace
—deeS in rock walls and IacinJ another cliII some Iour kilometers away—
Iar enouJh  above the desert to  avoid  worms but  close enouJh  Ior  easy
access beIore a crossinJ.
   She turned, seeinJ that  Paul had the tent uS, its  rib-domed hemisShere
blendinJ with the rock walls oI  the Iissure. Paul steSSed Sast her, liItinJ his
binoculars. He adMusted their internal Sressure with a Tuick twist, Iocused
the oil lenses on the other cliII,   liItinJ  Jolden  tan in morninJ  liJht  across
oSen sand.
   Jessica watched  as  he  studied  that  aSocalyStic landscaSe, his  eyes
SrobinJ into sand rivers and canyons.
   “There are JrowinJ thinJs over there,” he said.
   Jessica Iound the sSare binoculars in the Sack beside the tent, moved uS
beside Paul.
   “There,”  he said, holdinJ the binoculars with one hand and SointinJ with
the other.
   She looked where he Sointed.
   “SaJuaro,”  she said. “Scrawny stuII.”
   “There may be SeoSle nearby,” Paul said.
   “That  could be the remains oI a botanical testinJ station,” she warned.
   “This   is  Sretty  Iar  south  into  the  desert,”  he  said.  He  lowered  his
binoculars, rubbed beneath his Iilter baIIle, IeelinJ how dry and chaSSed his
liSs were,  sensinJ the dusty  taste oI  thirst  in  his  mouth.  “This  has the
IeelinJ oI a Fremen Slace,” he said.
   “Are  we certain the Fremen will be Iriendly?” she asked.
   “Kynes  Sromised their helS.”
   But  there’s desperation in  the people of this  desert, she thouJht.  I felt
some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.
   She closed her eyes and, aJainst this wasteland, conMured in her mind a
scene Irom Caladan. There had been a vacation triS once on Caladan—she
and the Duke  Leto, beIore  Paul’s birth.  They’d  Ilown  over  the southern
MunJles, above the weed-wild shoutinJ leaves and rice Saddies oI the deltas.
And they had seen the ant lines in the Jreenery—man-JanJs carryinJ their
loads on susSensor-buoyed shoulder Soles. And in the sea reaches there’d
been the white Setals oI trimaran dhows.

286
   All  oI it  Jone.
   Jessica oSened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mountinJ warmth oI
the day. Restless heat devils were beJinninJ to set the air aTuiver out on the
oSen sand. The other rock  Iace across Irom  them was like  a  thinJ  seen
throuJh cheaS Jlass.
   A  sSill oI sand sSread its brieI curtain across the oSen end oI the Iissure.
The sand hissed down, loosed by SuIIs oI  morninJ  breeze, by the hawks
that were beJinninJ to liIt   away Irom the cliIItoS.  When the sand-Iall was
Jone, she still heard it hissinJ. It Jrew louder, a sound that once heard, was
never IorJotten.
   “Worm,”  Paul whisSered.
   It   came Irom  their  riJht  with   an uncarinJ  maMesty that could not be
iJnored. A  twistinJ  burrow-mound  oI  sand cut throuJh  the dunes within
their Iield  oI  vision.  The mound liIted  in  Iront,  dustinJ away  like  a bow
wave in water. Then it was Jone, coursinJ oII to the leIt.
   The sound diminished, died.
   “I’ve  seen sSace IriJates that were smaller,” Paul whisSered.
   She nodded, continuinJ to  stare across the desert. Where the worm had
Sassed there remained that tantalizinJ JaS. It Ilowed bitterly endless beIore
them, beckoninJ beneath its horizontal collaSse oI skyline.
   “When   we’ve  rested,”  Jessica said,  “we   should  continue with   your
lessons.”
   He  suSSressed a sudden anJer, said: “Mother, don’t you think we could
do without….”
   “Today   you  Sanicked,” she  said. “You   know  your  mind  and  bindu-
nervature SerhaSs better than I do, but you’ve much yet to learn about your
body’s Srana-musculature. The body does thinJs oI itselI sometimes, Paul,
and I  can teach you about this.  You must  learn to control  every muscle,
every Iiber  oI your  body. You need review  oI the hands. We’ll  start with
IinJer muscles, Salm tendons, and tiS sensitivity.” She turned away. “Come,
into the tent, now.”
   He  Ile[ed  the IinJers  oI  his leIt  hand, watchinJ  her crawl  throuJh  the
sShincter  valve,  knowinJ    that   he  could   not   deIlect   her  Irom    this
determination … that he must aJree.
   Whatever has been done to me, I’ve been a party to it, he thouJht.
   Review oI the hand!

287
   He  looked  at  his  hand. How  inadeTuate it  aSSeared when measured
aJainst such creatures as that worm.

288
        We came from Caladan—a paradise world for our form of life. There existed no need on
        Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind—we could see the actuality all
        around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise
        in this life—we went soft, we lost our edge.
                                                       —from “Muad’Dib: ConYersations” by the Princess Irulan



 
  “SO YOU’RE   the  Jreat  Gurney   Halleck,”    the  man  said.
    Halleck    stood   starinJ    across   the   round   cavern    oIIice   at   the   smuJJler
seated behind   a  metal  desk.  The   man  wore  Fremen   robes  and  had  the  halI-
tint  blue  eyes  that  told   oI  oII-Slanet   Ioods   in  his  diet.  The   oIIice   duSlicated
a sSace  IriJate’s    master   control   center—communications        and  viewscreens
alonJ  a thirty-deJree     arc  oI wall,   remote   arminJ   and  IirinJ   banks   adMoininJ,
and the  desk Iormed   as a  wall  SroMection—Sart   oI  the remaininJ    curve.
    “I  am  Staban  Tuek,  son  oI  Esmar  Tuek,”   the  smuJJler   said.
    “Then   you’re   the  one  I  owe  thanks  Ior   the helS  we’ve   received,”    Halleck
said.
    “Ah-h-h,    Jratitude,”    the  smuJJler    said. “Sit   down.”
    A   shiS-tySe   bucket   seat  emerJed   Irom   the   wall   beside   the  screens  and
Halleck   sank   onto   it  with    a siJh,   IeelinJ    his   weariness.   He  could    see his
own  reIlection     now  in   a dark   surIace   beside  the   smuJJler    and  scowled   at
the  lines    oI  IatiJue     in  his   lumSy    Iace.   The   inkvine     scar  alonJ    his   Maw
writhed   with  the  scowl.
    Halleck    turned   Irom    his  reIlection,     stared   at  Tuek.   He   saw  the   Iamily
resemblance     in    the    smuJJler     now—the      Iather’s      heavy,    overhanJinJ
eyebrows  and  rock  Slanes  oI  cheeks  and nose.
    “Your    men    tell   me   your    Iather   is   dead,   killed     by   the   Harkonnens,”
Halleck   said.
    “By   the  Harkonnens   or  by  a traitor   amonJ  your  SeoSle,”   Tuek  said.
    AnJer    overcame   Sart  oI   Halleck’s    IatiJue.    He   straiJhtened,    said:   “Can
you  name the  traitor?”
    “We  are  not  sure.”
    “ThuIir    Hawat   susSected  the Lady   Jessica.”
    “Ah-h-h,      the  Bene    Gesserit   witch     …   SerhaSs.   But   Hawat    is   now    a
Harkonnen   caStive.”

289
   “I   heard,” Halleck  took  a deeS breath. “It  aSSears we’ve a deal more
killinJ  ahead oI us.”
   “We will  do nothinJ to attract attention to us,” Tuek said.
   Halleck stiIIened. “But—”
   “You   and those oI  your  men  we’ve  saved are welcome  to  sanctuary
amonJ us,” Tuek said. “You  sSeak oI Jratutude. Very well; work  oII  your
debt to us. We can always use Jood men. We’ll  destroy you  out oI  hand,
thouJh, iI you make the sliJhtest oSen move aJainst the Harkonnens.”
   “But  they killed your Iather, man!”
   “PerhaSs. And iI  so, I’ll   Jive  you my  Iather’s answer to those who act
without thinkinJ:   ‘A  stone is heavy and the sand is  weiJhty;  but a Iool’s
wrath is heavier than them both.’ ”
   “You  mean to do nothinJ about it, then?” Halleck sneered.
   “You  did  not hear me say that. I  merely say I  will  Srotect our  contract
with the Guild. The Guild  reTuires that we Slay a circumsSect Jame. There
are other ways oI destroyinJ a Ioe.”
   “Ah-h-h-h-h.”
   “Ah,  indeed. II you’ve a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But I warn
you that you’re Srobably too late … and we doubt she’s the one you want,
anyway.”
   “Hawat  made Iew mistakes.”
   “He  allowed himselI to Iall into Harkonnen hands.”
   “You  think he’s the traitor?”
   Tuek shruJJed. “This  is  academic. We think the witch is  dead. At least
the Harkonnens believe it.”
   “You  seem to know a Jreat deal about the Harkonnens.”
   “Hints  and suJJestions … rumors and hunches.”
   “We  are seventy-Iour men,”  Halleck  said. “II  you  seriously wish  us to
enlist with you, you must believe our Duke is dead.”
   “His  body has been seen.”
   “And  the boy, too—younJ Master Paul?” Halleck tried to swallow, Iound
a lumS in his throat.
   “AccordinJ   to the  last word  we had, he was lost  with  his mother  in a
desert storm. Likely not even their bones will ever be Iound.”
   “So  the witch is dead then … all dead.”
   Tuek nodded. “And  Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the
seat oI Sower here on Dune.”

290
   “The  Count Rabban oI Lankiveil?”
   “Yes.”
   It  took Halleck a moment to Sut down the uSsurJe oI raJe that threatened
to overcome him. He sSoke with SantinJ breath: “I’ve   a score oI my own
aJainst Rabban. I owe him Ior the lives oI my  Iamily….”  He rubbed at the
scar alonJ his Maw. “… and Ior this….”
   “One  does not risk everythinJ  to settle a score Srematurely,” Tuek said.
He Irowned, watchinJ the Slay oI muscles alonJ Halleck’s Maw, the sudden
withdrawal in the man’s shed-lidded eyes.
   “I  know … I  know.” Halleck took a deeS breath.
   “You  and your  men can work  out your  SassaJe oII Arrakis by  servinJ
with us. There are many Slaces to—”
   “I  release my men Irom any bond to me; they can choose Ior themselves.
With Rabban here—I stay.”
   “In  your mood, I’m  not sure we want you to stay.”
   Halleck stared at the smuJJler. “You doubt my word?”
   “No-o-o….”
   “You’ve  saved me Irom the Harkonnens. I Jave loyalty to the Duke Leto
Ior  no  Jreater  reason. I’ll   stay  on  Arrakis—with   you   …  or  with   the
Fremen.”
   “Whether  a thouJht is sSoken or not it is a real thinJ  and it has Sower,”
Tuek said.  “You  miJht  Iind  the  line  between liIe  and  death amonJ the
Fremen to be too sharS and Tuick.”
   Halleck  closed his  eyes brieIly, IeelinJ  the weariness surJe uS in  him.
“Where is the Lord who led  us throuJh the land oI deserts and oI Sits?” he
murmured.
   “Move   slowly   and the  day  oI  your  revenJe  will   come,”  Tuek  said.
“SSeed is a device oI Shaitan. Cool your sorrow—we’ve the diversions Ior
it;  three thinJs there are that  ease the heart—water, Jreen Jrass, and the
beauty oI woman.”
   Halleck  oSened his eyes. “I would SreIer the blood oI Rabban Harkonnen
IlowinJ about my Ieet.” He stared at Tuek. “You think that day will come?”
   “I   have little  to do  with how  you’ll  meet tomorrow,  Gurney Halleck.  I
can only helS you meet today.”
   “Then  I’ll  acceSt that helS and stay until the day you tell me to revenJe
your Iather and all the others who—”

291
   “Listen   to me,  fighting  man,”  Tuek  said. He leaned Iorward  over  his
desk, his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuJJler’s Iace was
suddenly like  weathered  stone. “My   Iather’s  water—I’ll   buy  that  back
myselI, with my own blade.”
   Halleck  stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the smuJJler reminded him
oI Duke Leto: a leader oI men, couraJeous, secure in his own Sosition and
his own course. He was like the Duke … beIore Arrakis.
   “Do  you wish my blade beside you?” Halleck asked.
   Tuek sat back, rela[ed, studyinJ Halleck silently.
   “Do  you think oI me as fighting man?” Halleck  Sressed.
   “You’re   the only  one oI  the Duke’s  lieutenants to escaSe,” Tuek said.
“Your enemy was overwhelminJ, yet you  rolled with  him…. You deIeated
him the way we deIeat Arrakis.”
   “Eh?”
   “We  live on suIIerance down here, Gurney Halleck,” Tuek said. “Arrakis
is our enemy.”
   “One enemy at a time, is that it?”
   “That’s  it.”
   “Is  that the way the Fremen make out?”
   “PerhaSs.”
   “You  said I  miJht Iind  liIe  with  the Fremen too touJh. They live  in the
desert, in the oSen, is that why?”
   “Who  knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-
man’s land. But I wish to talk more about—”
   “I’m   told that the Guild  seldom routes sSice liJhters in over the desert,”
Halleck said. “But  there are rumors that you can see bits oI Jreenery here
and there iI you know where to look.”
   “Rumors!”  Tuek sneered. “Do you wish  to choose now between me and
the Fremen? We have a measure oI security, our own sietch carved out oI
the rock, our  own hidden basins. We live  the lives  oI civilized   men. The
Fremen are a Iew raJJed bands that we use as sSice-hunters.”
   “But  they can kill Harkonnens.”
   “And  do  you wish to  know the result? Even now they are beinJ hunted
down like  animals—with lasJuns, because they have no shields. They are
beinJ e[terminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens.”
   “Was it Harkonnens they killed?” Halleck asked.
   “What  do you mean?”

292
   “Haven’t    you   heard  that   there  may’ve   been  Sardaukar  with   the
Harkonnens?”
   “More  rumors.”
   “But  a SoJrom—that isn’t like the Harkonnens. A SoJrom is wasteIul.”
   “I  believe what I  see with my own eyes,” Tuek said. “Make your choice,
IiJhtinJ  man. Me or the Fremen. I will Sromise you sanctuary and a chance
to draw the blood we both want. Be sure oI that. The Fremen will oIIer you
only the liIe oI the hunted.”
   Halleck  hesitated, sensinJ wisdom and symSathy in  Tuek’s words,  yet
troubled Ior no reason he could e[Slain.
   “Trust  your  own  abilities,”  Tuek said.  “Whose decisions brouJht  your
Iorce throuJh the battle? Yours. Decide.”
   “It  must be,” Halleck said. “The Duke and his son are dead?”
   “The  Harkonnens believe it. Where such thinJs are concerned, I incline
to trust  the Harkonnens.” A  Jrim  smile  touched Tuek’s mouth.  “But  it’s
about the only trust I Jive them.”
   “Then  it must be,” Halleck reSeated. He held out his riJht hand, Salm uS
and thumb Iolded Ilat  aJainst it  in the traditional  Jesture. “I  Jive you  my
sword.”
   “AcceSted.”
   “Do  you wish me to Sersuade my men?”
   “You’d  let them make their own decision?”
   “They’ve  Iollowed  me this Iar,  but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn’t
what they thouJht it’d  be. Here, they’ve lost  everythinJ e[ceSt their  lives.
I’d SreIer they decided Ior themselves now.”
   “Now  is no time Ior you to Ialter,”  Tuek said. “They’ve Iollowed you this
Iar.”
   “You  need them, is that it?”
   “We  can always  use e[Serienced IiJhtinJ  men …  in  these times more
than ever.”
   “You’ve  acceSted my sword. Do you wish me to Sersuade them?”
   “I  think they’ll  Iollow  you, Gurney Halleck.”
   “’Tis  to be hoSed.”
   “Indeed.”
   “I  may make my own decision in this, then?”
   “Your  own decision.”

293
   Halleck  Sushed himselI uS Irom the bucket seat, IeelinJ how much oI his
reserve strenJth even that small eIIort reTuired. “For now,  I’ll  see to their
Tuarters and well-beinJ,” he said.
   “Consult  my Tuartermaster,” Tuek said. “DrisT is his name. Tell him it’s
my wish that you receive every courtesy. I’ll Moin you myselI Sresently. I’ve
some oII-shiSments oI sSice to see to Iirst.”
   “Fortune Sasses everywhere,” Halleck said.
   “Everywhere,”  Tuek said. “A  time  oI uSset is a rare oSSortunity Ior our
business.”
   Halleck  nodded, heard the  Iaint  sussuration and Ielt  the air  shiIt  as a
lockSort swunJ oSen beside him. He turned, ducked throuJh it  and out oI
the oIIice.
   He Iound himselI  in the assembly hall throuJh which he and his men had
been led by Tuek’s aides. It was a lonJ,  Iairly  narrow area chewed out oI
the native rock, it’s smooth surIace betrayinJ the use oI cutteray burners Ior
the Mob. The ceilinJ stretched away hiJh  enouJh to  continue  the natural
suSSortinJ curve oI the rock and to Sermit internal air-convection currents.
WeaSons racks and lockers lined the walls.
   Halleck  noted with  a touch  oI Sride that  those oI his  men still  able to
stand were  standinJ—no  rela[ation   in  weariness and  deIeat Ior   them.
SmuJJler medics were movinJ  amonJ  them tendinJ  the wounded. Litter
cases were assembled in one area down to the leIt, each wounded man with
an Atreides comSanion.
   The  Atreides traininJ—“We  care for  our  own!”—it  held  like  a core oI
native rock in them, Halleck noted.
   One  oI  his  lieutenants steSSed Iorward carryinJ  Halleck’s  nine-strinJ
baliset out oI its case. The man snaSSed a salute, said: “Sir, the medics here
say there’s no hoSe Ior Mattai. They have no bone and orJan banks here—
only outSost medicine. Mattai can’t  last, they say, and he has a reTuest oI
you.”
   “What  is it?”
   The lieutenant thrust the baliset Iorward. “Mattai wants a sonJ to ease his
JoinJ,  sir. He  says you’ll   know  the  one …  he’s  asked it  oI  you  oIten
enouJh.” The lieutenant swallowed. “It’s the one called ‘My Woman,’ sir. II
you—”
   “I  know.”  Halleck took  the baliset, Ilicked the multiSick  out oI  its catch
on the IinJerboard. He  drew a soIt  chord Irom the  instrument, Iound that

294
someone had already tuned it. There was a burninJ in his eyes, but he drove
that out oI his thouJhts as he strolled Iorward, strumminJ the tune, IorcinJ
himselI to smile casually.
   Several oI  his  men and  a smuJJler  medic were  bent over  one oI  the
litters. One oI the men beJan sinJinJ soItly as Halleck aSSroached, catchinJ
the counter-beat with the ease oI lonJ Iamiliarity:

       “My  woman stands at her window, 
       Curved lines ‘Jainst sTuare Jlass.  
       USrais’d arms … bent … downIolded.  
       ’Gainst sunset red and Jolded— 
       Come to me …                           
       Come to me, warm arms oI my lass.  
       For me …                                          
       For me, the warm arms oI my lass.” 

   The sinJer stoSSed, reached out a bandaJed arm and closed the eyelids oI
the man on the litter.
   Halleck  drew a Iinal  soIt  chord Irom  the baliset, thinkinJ:  Now we are
seventy-three.

295
         Family life  of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to
         give you a capsule view of it. My  father had only one real friend, I  think. That was Count
         Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The
         Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and
         I  was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a
         matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene
         Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were
         constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at
         avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I’m not at all
         sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families.
         Here was a new slave concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She
         had a dancer’s muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father
         looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: “She is
         too  beautiful. We will save her as a gift.”  You have no idea how much consternation this
         restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly
         threats to us all.
                                                                            -“In  My Father’s House” by the Princess Irulan



 
P AUL    STOOD      outside     the    stilltent      in   the    late   aIternoon.       The    crevasse
where   he   had  Sitched    their    camS   lay   in   deeS  shadow.    He   stared   out   across
the  oSen  sand   at  the  distant    cliII,     wonderinJ      iI  he  should    waken    his  mother,
who   lay  asleeS   in  the  tent.
    Folds    uSon    Iolds    oI   dunes    sSread   beyond     their    shelter.    Away    Irom     the
settinJ   sun,   the  dunes   e[Sosed    Jreased    shadows    so  black   they   were   like    bits
oI  niJht.
    And    the  Ilatness.
    His   mind    searched    Ior   somethinJ     tall    in  that   landscaSe.    But   there   was   no
SersuadinJ     tallness    out    oI   heat-addled     air   and   that    horizon—no       bloom     or
Jently    shaken   thinJ    to  mark    the  SassaJe   oI   a breeze   …   only    dunes   and  that
distant   cliII    beneath    a sky   oI  burnished     silver-blue.
    What    if  there   isn’t   one   of  the   abandoned     testing    stations    across   there?    he
wondered.     What    if  there    are   no   Fremen,    either,    and   the   plants    we   see  are
only   an  accident?
    Within      the    tent,    Jessica    awakened,      turned     onto    her    back    and    Seered
sidelonJ    out   the   transSarent    end   at  Paul.   He   stood   with    his   back   to  her   and
somethinJ     about    his  stance   reminded     her   oI   his  Iather.    She   sensed   the  well
oI  JrieI   risinJ    within     her  and   turned   away.

296
   Presently she adMusted her stillsuit, reIreshed herselI with water Irom the
tent’s catchSocket, and sliSSed out to stand and stretch the sleeS Irom her
muscles.
   Paul sSoke without turninJ: “I Iind  myselI enMoyinJ the Tuiet here.”
   How  the  mind  gears itself  for  its  environment, she thouJht.  And  she
recalled a Bene Gesserit a[iom:  “The  mind can go either  direction under
stress—towardpositive or  toward  negative:  on or   off.  Think  of  it  as  a
spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the  negative end  and
hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under
stress is strongly influenced by training. ”
   “It  could be a Jood liIe here,” Paul said.
   She tried to see the desert throuJh his eyes, seekinJ to encomSass all the
riJors  this  Slanet acceSted as commonSlace, wonderinJ at  the  Sossible
Iutures Paul  had JlimSsed.  One could  be  alone  out  here, she thouJht,
without fear of someone behind you, without fear of the hunter.
   She steSSed Sast Paul, liIted her binoculars, adMusted the oil lenses and
studied the escarSment across Irom them. Yes, saJuaro in the arroyos and
other sSiny Jrowth  … and  a mattinJ oI  low  Jrasses, yellow-Jreen in  the
shadows.
   “I’ll   strike camS,” Paul said.
   Jessica nodded, walked  to the  Iissure’s mouth  where she  could Jet  a
sweeS oI the desert, and swunJ her binoculars to the leIt. A salt San Jlared
white there with  a blendinJ oI  dirty  tan at its  edJes—a Iield oI  white out
here where white was death. But the San said another thinJ: water. At some
time  water   had  Ilowed   across  that  JlarinJ   white.   She  lowered   her
binoculars, adMusted her burnoose, listened Ior a moment to the sound oI
Paul’s movements.
   The  sun diSSed lower. Shadows stretched across the salt San. Lines oI
wild  color  sSread over the sunset horizon. Color  streamed into  a toe  oI
darkness testinJ the  sand.  Coal-colored shadows sSread, and  the  thick
collaSse oI niJht blotted the desert.
   Stars!
   She stared uS at them, sensinJ Paul’s movements as he came uS beside
her. The desert niJht Iocused uSward with a IeelinJ oI liIt toward the stars.
The weiJht oI  the day receded. There came a brieI Ilurry oI  breeze across
her Iace.

297
   “The  Iirst   moon will   be uS soon,”  Paul said.  “The  Sack’s ready. I’ve
Slanted the thumSer.”
   We could  be lost forever  in this  hellplace, she thouJht.  And no  one to
know.
   The niJht  wind sSread sand runnels that Jrated across her Iace, brinJinJ
the smell oI cinnamon: a shower oI odors in the dark.
   “Smell  that,” Paul said.
   “I  can smell it  even throuJh the Iilter,” she said. “Riches. But will  it  buy
water?” She Sointed across the basin. “There are no artiIicial liJhts across
there.”
   “Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks,” he said.
   A  sill  oI silver Sushed above the horizon to their riJht: the Iirst moon. It
liIted into view, the hand Sattern Slain on its Iace. Jessica studied the white-
silver oI sand e[Sosed in the liJht.
   “I   Slanted the thumSer in the  deeSest Sart oI the crevasse,” Paul said.
“Whenever I liJht its candle it’ll  Jive us about thirty minutes.”
   “Thirty  minutes?”
   “BeIore  it starts callinJ … a … worm.”
   “Oh.  I’m ready to Jo.”
   He  sliSSed away Irom her side and she heard his SroJress back uS their
Iissure.
   The night  is a  tunnel, she thouJht, a hole  into tomorrow  … if  we’re  to
have a tomorrow. She shook her  head. Why must I  be so morbid?  I was
trained better than that!
   Paul returned, took uS the Sack, led the way down to the Iirst  sSreadinJ
dune where he stoSSed and listened as his mother came uS behind him. He
heard her soIt  SroJress and the cold sinJle-Jrain  dribbles  oI  sound—the
desert’s own code sSellinJ out its measure oI saIety.
   “We  must walk without  rhythm,”  Paul said and he called uS memory oI
men walkinJ the sand … both Srescient memory and real memory.
   “Watch how I  do it,” he said. “This is how Fremen walk the sand.”
   He steSSed out onto the windward Iace oI the dune, IollowinJ  the curve
oI it, moved with a draJJinJ Sace.
   Jessica studied his SroJress Ior ten  steSs, Iollowed, imitatinJ  him.  She
saw the sense oI it: they must sound like the natural shiItinJ oI sand … like
the wind. But muscles Srotested this unnatural, broken Sattern: SteS … draJ
… draJ … steS … steS … wait… draJ … steS …

298
   Time stretched out around them. The rock Iace ahead seemed to Jrow no
nearer. The one behind still towered hiJh.
   “LumS!  LumS! LumS! LumS!”
   It  was a drumminJ Irom the cliII behind.
   “The  thumSer,” Paul hissed.
   Its SoundinJ continued and the Iound diIIiculty  avoidinJ the rhythm oI it
in their stride.
   “LumS  … lumS … lumS … lumS….”
   They  moved in  a moonlit  bowl  Sunctured by that  hollowed thumSinJ.
Down  and uS throuJh  sSillinJ   dunes: steS …  draJ  …  wait  …  steS….
Across Sea sand that rolled under their Ieet: draJ … wait … steS….
   And  all the while their ears searched Ior a sSecial hissinJ.
   The sound, when it came, started so low that their own draJJinJ SassaJe
masked it. But it Jrew … louder and louder … out oI the west.
   “LumS  … lumS … lumS … lumS….” drummed the thumSer.
   The hissinJ  aSSroach sSread across the niJht behind them. They turned
their heads as they walked, saw the mound oI the coursinJ worm.
   “KeeS movinJ,”  Paul whisSered. “Don’t look back.”
   A  JratinJ sound oI Iury  e[Sloded Irom the rock shadows they had leIt. It
was a IlailinJ avalanche oI noise.
   “KeeS movinJ,”  Paul reSeatinJ.
   He  saw that  they had reached an unmarked Soint  where the two  rock
Iaces—the one ahead and the one behind—aSSeared eTually remote.
   And  still behind them, that whiSSinJ, Irenzied tearinJ oI rocks dominated
the niJht.
   They moved on and on and on…. Muscles reached a staJe oI mechanical
achinJ  that  seemed to  stretch  out  indeIinitely,   but  Paul  saw  that  the
beckoninJ escarSment ahead oI them had climbed hiJher.
   Jessica moved in a void oI  concentration, aware that the Sressure oI her
will  alone keSt her walkinJ.  Dryness ached in her mouth,  but the sounds
behind drove  away  all  hoSe  oI  stoSSinJ Ior  a  siS  Irom  her  stillsuit’s
catchSockets.
   “LumS  … lumS….”
   Renewed Irenzy eruSted Irom the distant cliII, drowninJ out the thumSer.
   Silence!
   “Faster,” Paul whisSered.

299
   She nodded, knowinJ he did not see the Jesture, but needinJ the action to
tell herselI that  it was necessary to demand even more Irom muscles that
already were beinJ ta[ed to their limits—the unnatural movement….
   The  rock Iace oI  saIety ahead oI them climbed  into the stars, and Paul
saw a Slane oI  Ilat  sand stretchinJ  out at  the base. He  steSSed onto it,
stumbled in his IatiJue, riJhted himselI with an involuntary out-thrustinJ oI
a Ioot.
   Resonant boominJ shook the sand around them.
   Paul lurched sideways two steSs.
   “Boom!  Boom!”
   “Drum  sand!” Jessica hissed.
   Paul recovered his balance. A sweeSinJ Jlance took in  the sand around
them, the rock escarSment SerhaSs two hundred meters away.
   Behind  them, he  heard a hissinJ—like   the wind,  like  a  riStide where
there was no water.
   “Run!”  Jessica screamed. “Paul, run!”
   They ran.
   Drum  sound boomed beneath their Ieet. Then they were out oI it and into
Sea Jravel. For a time, the runninJ was a relieI to muscles that ached Irom
unIamiliar, rhythmless use. Here was action that could be understood. Here
was rhythm.  But sand and  Jravel draJJed  at their  Ieet. And  the  hissinJ
aSSroach oI the worm was storm sound that Jrew around them.
   Jessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think oI was the IatiJue and
the sound and the terror.
   Paul draJJed her uS.
   They ran on, hand in hand.
   A  thin  Sole Mutted Irom the sand ahead oI  them. They  Sassed it, saw
another.
   Jessica’s mind Iailed to reJister on the Soles until they were Sast.
   There was another-wind-etched surIace thrust uS Irom a crack in rock.
   Another.
   Rock!
   She Ielt it  throuJh her Ieet, the shock oI unresistinJ surIace, Jained new
strenJth Irom the Iirmer IootinJ.
   A  deeS crack stretched its vertical shadow uSward into the cliII ahead oI
them. They sSrinted Ior it, crowded into the narrow hole.
   Behind them, the sound oI the worm’s SassaJe stoSSed.

300
   Jessica and Paul turned, Seered out onto the desert.
   Where the dunes beJan, SerhaSs IiIty meters away at the Ioot oI a rock
beach, a silver-Jray curve broached Irom the desert, sendinJ rivers oI sand
and dust  cascadinJ  all  around.  It  liIted   hiJher,  resolved  into  a  Jiant,
TuestinJ mouth. It  was a  round, black  hole with   edJes JlisteninJ  in the
moonliJht.
   The  mouth  snaked toward  the  narrow  crack where  Paul  and Jessica
huddled. Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. MoonliJht   Ilashed Irom crystal
teeth.
   Back and Iorth the Jreat mouth wove.
   Paul stilled his breathinJ.
   Jessica crouched starinJ.
   It  took  intense concentration oI her Bene Gesserit traininJ to  Sut down
the Srimal terrors, subduinJ a race-memory Iear that threatened to Iill  her
mind.
   Paul Ielt  a kind oI  elation. In some recent instant, he had crossed a time
barrier into  more unknown  territory. He  could  sense the darkness ahead,
nothinJ revealed to his inner eye. It was as thouJh some steS he had taken
had SlunJed him  into a  well  …  or into  the trouJh  oI  a wave  where the
Iuture was invisible. The landscaSe had underJone a SroIound shiItinJ.
   Instead oI IriJhteninJ  him, the sensation oI time-darkness Iorced a hySer-
acceleration oI   his  other   senses. He  Iound  himselI   reJisterinJ   every
available asSect oI the thinJ that liIted Irom the sand there seekinJ him. Its
mouth was some eiJhty meters in diameter … crystal teeth with the curved
shaSe oI crysknives  JlintinJ   around  the  rim  …  the  bellows  breath  oI
cinnamon, subtle aldehydes … acids….
   The worm  blotted out the moonliJht as it brushed the rocks above them.
A shower oI small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hidinJ Slace.
   Paul crowded his mother Iarther back.
   Cinnamon!
   The smell oI it Ilooded across him.
   What has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himselI. And
he remembered Liet-Kynes betrayinJ a veiled reIerence to some association
between worm and sSice.
   “Barrrroooom!”
   It  was like a Seal oI dry thunder cominJ Irom Iar oII to their riJht.
   AJain:  “Barrrroooom!”

301
   The  worm  drew back onto  the sand, lay  there momentarily, its  crystal
teeth weavinJ moonIlashes.
   “LumS!  LumS! LumS! LumS!”
   Another thumper! Paul thouJht.
   AJain  it sounded oII to their riJht.
   A  shudder Sassed throuJh the worm. It drew Iarther away into the sand.
Only a mounded uSSer curve remained like halI a bell mouth, the curve oI a
tunnel rearinJ above the dunes.
   Sand rasSed.
   The  creature sank  Iarther, retreatinJ,  turninJ.  It   became a mound  oI
crestinJ sand that curved away throuJh a saddle in the dunes.
   Paul steSSed out oI the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the
waste toward the new thumSer summons.
   Jessica Iollowed,   listeninJ:   “LumS   …  lumS   …  lumS  …   lumS  …
lumS….”
   Presently the sound stoSSed.
   Paul Iound the tube into his stillsuit, siSSed at the reclaimed water.
   Jessica Iocused on his action, but her mind Ielt blank with IatiJue and the
aItermath oI terror. “Has it Jone Ior sure?” she whisSered.
   “Somebody called it,”  Paul said. “Fremen.”
   She Ielt herselI recoverinJ. “It was so biJ!”
   “Not  as as biJ as the one that Jot our ’thoSter.”
   “Are  you sure it was Fremen?”
   “They  used a thumSer.”
   “Why  would they helS us?”
   “Maybe  they weren’t helSinJ us. Maybe they were Must callinJ a worm.”
   “Why?”
   An  answer lay Soised at the edJe oI his awareness, but reIused to come.
He had a vision in his mind oI somethinJ to do with the telescoSinJ barbed
sticks in their Sacks—the “maker hooks.”
   “Why  would they call a worm?” Jessica asked.
   A  breath oI  Iear touched his mind,  and he Iorced himselI  to turn away
Irom his  mother, to  look  uS the cliII.   “We’d  better  Iind  a way  uS there
beIore dayliJht.”  He Sointed. “Those Soles we Sassed—there are more oI
them.”
   She  looked,  IollowinJ    the  line  oI   his  hand,  saw  the  Soles—wind-
scratched markers—made out the shadow oI a  narrow ledJe that  twisted

302
into a crevasse hiJh above them.
   “They  mark a way  uS the cliII,”  Paul said. He settled his shoulders into
the Sack, crossed to the Ioot oI the ledJe and beJan the climb uSward.
   Jessica  waited  a  moment,  restinJ,  restorinJ   her  strenJth;  then  she
Iollowed.
   US they climbed, IollowinJ   the Juide Soles until the ledJe dwindled to a
narrow liS at the mouth oI a dark crevasse.
   Paul tiSSed his head to Seer into the shadowed Slace. He could Ieel the
Srecarious hold his Ieet had on the slender ledJe, but Iorced himselI to slow
caution. He  saw  only   darkness within  the  crevasse. It  stretched  away
uSward, oSen to the stars at the toS. His ears searched, Iound only sounds
he could e[Sect—a tiny  sSill oI  sand, an insect brrr, the Satter oI  a small
runninJ  creature. He tested the  darkness in  the crevasse with  one Ioot,
Iound rock beneath a JrittinJ surIace. Slowly, he inched around the corner,
siJnaled Ior  his mother  to Iollow.   He JrasSed a loose edJe oI  her  robe,
helSed her around.
   They  looked uSward at starliJht  Iramed by two  rock liSs.  Paul saw his
mother beside him as a cloudy  Jray  movement. “II  we could  only  risk a
liJht,”  he whisSered.
   “We have other senses than eyes,” she said.
   Paul  slid a Ioot  Iorward,  shiIted his  weiJht, and Srobed with  the other
Ioot, met an obstruction. He liIted his Ioot,  Iound a steS, Sulled himselI uS
onto it. He reached back, Ielt his mother’s arm, tuJJed at her robe Ior her to
Iollow.
   Another steS.
   “It  Joes on uS to the toS, I think,” he whisSered.
   Shallow and even steps, Jessica thouJht. Man-carved beyond a doubt.
   She Iollowed  the shadowy movement oI Paul’s SroJress, IeelinJ out the
steSs. Rock walls narrowed until her  shoulders almost brushed them. The
steSs ended in a slitted deIile about twenty meters lonJ, its Iloor level, and
this oSened onto a shallow, moonlit basin.
   Paul steSSed out into the rim oI the basin, whisSered: “What a beautiIul
Slace.”
   Jessica could  only  stare in  silent  aJreement Irom  her Sosition  a steS
behind him.
   In  sSite oI  weariness, the irritation   oI recaths and nose SluJs  and the
conIinement oI the stillsuit,  in  sSite oI Iear and the achinJ desire Ior  rest,

303
this basin’s beauty Iilled her senses, IorcinJ her to stoS and admire it.
   “Like  a Iairyland,”  Paul whisSered.
   Jessica nodded.
   SSreadinJ away in  Iront  oI her  stretched desert Jrowth—bushes, cacti,
tiny clumSs oI leaves—all tremblinJ  in the moonliJht.  The rinJwalls  were
dark to her leIt, moonIrosted on her riJht.
   “This  must be a Fremen Slace,” Paul said.
   “There  would  have to  be SeoSle Ior this  many Slants to survive,”  she
aJreed. She uncaSSed the tube to her stillsuit’s catchSockets, siSSed at it.
Warm, Iaintly  acrid wetness sliSSed down her throat. She marked how  it
reIreshed her. The tube’s caS Jrated aJainst Ilakes oI sand as she reSlaced it.
   Movement  cauJht Paul’s attention—to his  riJht  and down on the basin
Iloor curvinJ  out beneath them. He stared down throuJh smoke bushes and
weeds into a wedJed slab sand-surIace oI moonliJht  inhabited by  an up-
hop, jump, pop-hop oI tiny motion.
   “Mice!”   he hissed.
   Pop-hop-hop! they went, into shadows and out.
   SomethinJ  Iell soundlessly Sast their eyes into the  mice. There came a
thin screech, a IlaSSinJ oI winJs, and a Jhostly Jray bird liIted away across
the basin with a small, dark shadow in its talons.
   We needed that reminder, Jessica thouJht.
   Paul  continued to stare across the basin. He  inhaled, sensed the soItly
cuttinJ contralto smell  oI saJe climbinJ  the niJht. The Sredatory bird—he
thouJht oI it as the way oI this desert. It had brouJht a stillness to the basin
so unuttered that the blue-milk  moonliJht  could  almost be heard IlowinJ
across sentinel saJuaro and sSiked Saintbush. There was a low humminJ oI
liJht here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.
   “We’d  better Iind  a Slace to Sitch the tent,” he said. “Tomorrow we  can
try to Iind the Fremen who—”
   “Most  intruders here reJret IindinJ the Fremen!”
   It  was a heavy masculine voice choSSinJ across his words, shatterinJ the
moment. The voice came Irom above them and to their riJht.
   “Please do not run,  intruders,” the voice said as Paul made to withdraw
into the deIile. “II you run you’ll  only waste your body’s water.”
   They want  us for  the water  of our  flesh!  Jessica thouJht. Her muscles
overrode all   IatiJue,  Ilowed  into   ma[imum   readiness without  e[ternal
betrayal. She SinSointed the location oI the voice, thinkinJ: Such stealth! I

304
didn’t hear him. And she realized that the owner oI that voice had Sermitted
himselI only the small sounds, the natural sounds oI the desert.
   Another  voice called Irom  the basin’s rim  to their  leIt.  “Make it  Tuick,
Stil.  Get their  water  and let’s  be on  our way.  We’ve  little  enouJh time
beIore dawn.”
   Paul,  less  conditioned  to  emerJency  resSonse than his   mother, Ielt
chaJrin that he had stiIIened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his
abilities  by  a  momentary  Sanic.  He  Iorced  himselI  now   to  obey  her
teachinJs: rela[,  than Iall  into  the semblance oI  rela[ation,  then into  the
arrested whiSsnaS oI muscles that can slash in any direction.
   Still,  he Ielt  the edJe oI Iear  within  him and knew its  source. This was
blind time,  no Iuture  he had seen … and they were  cauJht between wild
Fremen whose only   interest was  the water  carried  in  the  Ilesh oI   two
unshielded bodies.

305
        This Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize as “The
        Pillars of the Universe,” whose 4izara Tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and
        prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the
        stirring music built on the old forms, but stamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard
        and been deeply moved by “The Old Man’s Hymn”? I drove my feet through a desert Whose
        mirage fluttered like a host. Voracious for glory, greedy for danger, I roamed the horizons of
        al-Kulab. Watching time level mountains In its search and its hunger for me. And I saw the
        sparrows swiftly approach, Bolder than the onrushing wolf. They spread in the tree of my
        youth. I heard the flock in my branches And was caught on their beaks and claws!
                                                                —from “Arrakis AwakeninJ” by the Princess Irulan



 
  THE MAN   crawled   across  a dunetoS.   He  was  a mote  cauJht   in  the  Jlare  oI
the  noon  sun.  He   was  dressed  only   in  torn   remnants   oI   a Mubba cloak,   his
skin  bare  to the  heat  throuJh   the  tatters.  The  hood  had  been  riSSed  Irom   the
cloak,  but  the  man  had  Iashioned   a  turban  Irom   a  torn  striS  oI  cloth.   WisSs
oI sandy   hair  Srotruded   Irom  it,  matched   by  a sSarse beard  and  thick   brows.
Beneath  the  blue-within-blue       eyes,  remains  oI   a dark   stain  sSread  down   to
his cheeks.  A  matted   deSression  across  mustache  and  beard  showed  where   a
stillsuit   tube  had  marked  out  its  Sath Irom   nose to  catchSockets.
    The   man   stoSSed  halI    across  the   dunecrest,    arms   stretched   down    the
sliSIace.  Blood   had  clotted   on his  back  and  on  his  arms  and leJs.  Patches  oI
yellow-Jray     sand clunJ   to  the  wounds.   Slowly,    he  brouJht   his  hands  under
him,   Sushed   himselI    to  his   Ieet,   stood   there   swayinJ.    And    even   in  this
almost-random    action  there  remained   a trace  oI  once-Srecise   movement.
    “I   am Liet-Kynes,”      he said,  addressinJ   himselI   to  the  emSty  horizon,   and
his  voice   was  a  hoarse  caricature   oI   the  strenJth   it  had   known.   “I   am  His
ImSerial   MaMesty’s   PlanetoloJist,”      he  whisSered,    “Slanetary    ecoloJist    Ior
Arrakis.   I  am steward   oI  this  land.”
    He   stumbled,    Iell   sideways    alonJ   the   crusty    surIace   oI   the  windward
Iace. His   hands duJ  Ieebly   into   the sand.
    I  am steward   of this  sand,  he  thouJht.
    He  realized   that he  was  semi-delirious,    that  he  should  diJ  himselI    into  the
sand,  Iind   the  relatively    cool   underlayer    and  cover  himselI    with   it.   But  he
could    still     smell    the    rank,    semisweet    esthers    oI    a   Sre-sSice    Socket
somewhere   underneath   this   sand.  He   knew   the  Seril  within    this   Iact   more
certainly   than  any   other  Fremen.   II  he  could   smell   the  Sre-sSice  mass,  that

306
meant the Jasses deeS under the sand were nearinJ e[Slosive Sressure. He
had to Jet away Irom here.
   His hands made weak scrabblinJ motions alonJ the dune Iace.
   A  thouJht  sSread across his mind—clear, distinct: The real wealth of a
planet  is  in  its  landscape,  how  we  take part   in  that  basic  source  of
civilization—agriculture.
   And  he thouJht how stranJe it was that the mind, lonJ  Ii[ed  on a sinJle
track, could not Jet oII that track. The Harkonnen trooSers had leIt him here
without  water or  stillsuit,  thinkinJ   a worm  would  Jet  him  iI  the  desert
didn’t. They  had thouJht it amusinJ to  leave him alive to  die by inches at
the imSersonal hands oI his Slanet.
   The Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill  Fremen, he thouJht. We
don’t die easily. I should be dead now … I will  be dead soon … but I can’t
stop being an ecologist.
   “The  hiJhest Iunction oI ecoloJy is understandinJ conseTuences.”
   The voice  shocked him because he recoJnized it and knew the owner oI
it was dead. It was the voice oI his Iather who  had been SlanetoloJist here
beIore him—his Iather lonJ dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.
   “Got  yourselI into  Tuite a Ii[  here, Son,” his Iather said. “You should’ve
known the conseTuences oI tryinJ to helS the child oI that Duke.”
   I’m  delirious, Kynes thouJht.
   The voice seemed to come Irom his riJht. Kynes scraSed his Iace throuJh
sand, turninJ to look in  that direction—nothinJ e[ceSt  a curvinJ stretch oI
dune dancinJ with heat devils in the Iull Jlare oI the sun.
   “The  more liIe   there is within  a  system, the more niches there are Ior
liIe,”  his Iather said. And  the voice  came now Irom  his leIt,  Irom behind
him.
   Why does he keep moving around? Kynes asked himself. Doesn’t he want
me to see him?
   “LiIe   imSroves the caSacity oI the environment to sustain liIe,” his Iather
said. “LiIe  makes needed nutrients more readily  available. It  binds  more
enerJy into  the system throuJh  the  tremendous chemical interSlay Irom
orJanism to orJanism.”
   Why does he keep harping on the same subject? Kynes asked himselI. I
knew that before I was ten.
   Desert hawks,  carrion-eaters in this  land as were  most wild  creatures,
beJan to circle over him.  Kynes saw a shadow Sass near his hand, Iorced

307
his head Iarther around to look uSward. The birds were a blurred Satch on
silver-blue sky—distant Ilecks oI soot IloatinJ above him.
   “We  are Jeneralists,” his Iather said. “You  can’t draw neat lines around
Slanet-wide Sroblems. PlanetoloJy is a cut-and-Iit science.”
   What’s he trying to tell  me? Kynes wondered. Is there some conseTuence
I failed to see?
   His  cheek slumSed back aJainst the hot sand, and he smelled the burned
rock odor beneath the Sre-sSice Jasses. From some corner oI loJic in his
mind, a thouJht  Iormed: Those are carrion-eater  birds  over me. Perhaps
some of my Fremen will see them and come to investigate.
   “To  the workinJ SlanetoloJist, his most imSortant tool is human beinJs,”
his Iather said. “You  must cultivate  ecoloJical literacy  amonJ the SeoSle.
That’s why I’ve created this entirely new Iorm oI ecoloJical notation.”
   He’s repeating things he said to me when I was a child, Kynes thouJht.
   He beJan to Ieel cool,  but that corner oI loJic  in his mind told  him: The
sun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you’re hot; the sun is burning the
moisture out of your body.
   His IinJers  clawed Ieebly at the sand.
   They couldn’t even leave me a stillsuit!
   “The  Sresence oI moisture in the air helSs Srevent too-raSid evaSoration
Irom livinJ  bodies,” his Iather said.
   Why does he keep repeating the obvious? Kynes wondered.
   He tried to think  oI moisture in the air—Jrass coverinJ this dune … oSen
water somewhere beneath him, a lonJ Tanat IlowinJ with water oSen to the
sky e[ceSt in  te[t  illustrations.  OSen water … irriJation   water …  it took
Iive  thousand cubic meters oI   water to  irriJate  one hectare oI  land  Ser
JrowinJ season, he remembered.
   “Our  Iirst  Joal on Arrakis,”   his Iather said, “is  Jrassland Srovinces. We
will  start  with  these  mutated Soverty Jrasses. When  we  have moisture
locked in Jrasslands, we’ll move on to start uSland Iorests, then a Iew oSen
bodies oI  water—small  at  Iirst—and  situated  alonJ  lines  oI  SrevailinJ
winds with windtraS moisture SreciSitators sSaced in the lines to recaSture
what the wind steals. We must create a true sirocco—a moist wind—but we
will never Jet away Irom the necessity Ior windtraSs.”
   Always lecturing  me, Kynes thouJht. Why doesn’t he shut up? Can’t  he
see I’m dying?

308
   “You  will  die, too,” his Iather said, “iI  you don’t Jet oII  the bubble that’s
IorminJ riJht  now deeS underneath you. It’s there and you know it. You can
smell the Sre-sSice Jasses. You know the little makers are beJinninJ to lose
some oI their water into the mass.”
   The  thouJht oI  that water beneath him was maddeninJ. He imaJined it
now—sealed oII in  strata oI  Sorous rock by  the leathery halI-Slant, halI-
animal little makers—and the thin ruSture that was SourinJ a cool stream oI
clearest, Sure, liTuid, soothinJ water into….
   A pre-spice mass!
   He  inhaled,  smellinJ  the  rank sweetness. The odor  was  much richer
around him than it had been.
   Kynes  Sushed himselI to  his  knees, heard a bird  screech, the hurried
IlaSSinJ oI winJs.
   This is spice desert, he thouJht. There must be Fremen about even in the
day sun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.
   “Movement  across the landscaSe is a necessity Ior animal liIe,” his Iather
said. “Nomad SeoSles Iollow the same necessity. Lines oI movement adMust
to Shysical needs Ior water, Iood, minerals. We must control this movement
now, aliJn it Ior our SurSoses.”
   “Shut uS, old man,” Kynes muttered.
   “We  must  do a thinJ  on  Arrakis  never beIore  attemSted Ior an entire
Slanet,” his  Iather said. “We  must  use man as a  constructive ecoloJical
Iorce—insertinJ adaSted terraIorm liIe: a Slant here, an animal there, a man
in  that  Slace—to  transIorm  the  water  cycle,  to  build   a  new  kind   oI
landscaSe.”
   “Shut uS!”  Kynes croaked.
   “It   was lines oI movement that Jave us the Iirst  clue to the relationshiS
between worms and sSice,” his Iather said.
   A  worm, Kynes  thouJht with  a surJe oI  hoSe. A maker’s sure to come
when this bubble bursts. But I have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker
without hooks?
   He  could Ieel  Irustration saSSinJ what little   strenJth remained to him.
Water so near—only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to
come, but no way to traS it on the surIace and use it.
   Kynes Sitched Iorward onto the sand, returninJ to the shallow deSression
his movements had deIined. He Ielt sand hot aJainst his leIt cheek, but the
sensation was remote.

309
   “The  Arrakeen environment  built itselI  into  the evolutionary  Sattern oI
native liIe  Iorms,”  his Iather  said. “How  stranJe that so  Iew SeoSle ever
looked uS Irom the sSice lonJ enouJh to wonder at the near-ideal nitroJen-
o[yJen-CO2 balance beinJ maintained here in the absence oI larJe areas oI
Slant cover. The enerJy sShere oI the Slanet is there to see and understand
—a relentless Srocess, but a Srocess nonetheless. There is a JaS in it? Then
somethinJ occuSies that JaS. Science is made uS oI so many  thinJs that
aSSear obvious aIter they are e[Slained. I knew the little maker was there,
deeS in the sand, lonJ beIore I ever saw it.”
   “Please stoS lecturinJ me, Father,” Kynes whisSered.
   A  hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it Iold
its winJs, tiS its head to stare at him. He summoned the enerJy to croak at
it. The bird hoSSed away two steSs, but continued to stare at him.
   “Men  and their works have been a disease on the surIace oI their Slanets
beIore now,” his  Iather said. “Nature tends to comSensate Ior diseases, to
remove or encaSsulate them, to incorSorate them into the system in her own
way.”
   The   hawk  lowered  its  head,  stretched its   winJs,  reIolded   them.  It
transIerred its attention to his outstretched hand.
   Kynes Iound that he no lonJer had the strenJth to croak at it.
   “The   historical  system oI  mutual  SillaJe and  e[tortion   stoSs here on
Arrakis,” his Iather said. “You cannot Jo on Iorever stealinJ what you need
without reJard to those who come aIter. The Shysical Tualities oI  a Slanet
are written into  its  economic and Solitical  record. We have the record  in
Iront oI us and our course is obvious.”
   He  never  could  stop  lecturing,   Kynes  thouJht.  Lecturing,  lecturing,
lecturing—alwayslecturing.
   The hawk hoSSed one steS closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand, turned its
head Iirst one way and then the other to study the e[Sosed Ilesh.
   “Arrakis   is a one-croS Slanet,” his Iather said. “One  croS. It suSSorts a
rulinJ class that lives as rulinJ classes have lived in all times while, beneath
them, a  semihuman mass oI  semislaves e[ists  on  the leavinJs.  It’s  the
masses and the leavinJs  that occuSy  our  attention. These are  Iar  more
valuable than has ever been susSected.”
   “I’m   iJnorinJ you, Father,” Kynes whisSered. “Go away.”
   And  he thouJht:  Surely there  must be some of my  Fremen near. They
cannot help but see the birds over me. They will investigate if only to see if

310
there’s moisture available.
   “The  masses oI Arrakis will   know that we  work to  make the land Ilow
with  water,” his  Iather said.  “Most  oI  them, oI  course, will  have only  a
semimystical  understandinJ oI   how  we  intend   to  do  this.  Many,   not
understandinJ the Srohibitive  mass-ratio Sroblem, may  even think  we’ll
brinJ water Irom some other Slanet rich in it. Let  them think anythinJ they
wish as lonJ as they believe in us.”
   In  a minute I’ll   get up and tell  him what I  think of him,  Kynes thouJht.
Standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me.
   The bird  took another hoS closer to Kynes’ outstretched hand. Two more
hawks driIted down to the sand behind it.
   “ReliJion   and law  amonJ our  masses must be one and the same,” his
Iather said. “An   act oI  disobedience must be a sin  and reTuire reliJious
Senalties. This will have the dual beneIit oI brinJinJ both Jreater obedience
and Jreater  bravery. We  must  deSend not so  much  on  the  bravery oI
individuals, you see, as uSon the bravery oI a whole SoSulation.”
   Where is  my population  now when I  need it  most? Kynes thouJht. He
summoned all his  strenJth, moved  his hand a  IinJer’s  width  toward  the
nearest hawk. It  hoSSed backward amonJ its  comSanions and all  stood
Soised Ior IliJht.
   “Our  timetable  will  achieve the  stature oI  a natural Shenomenon,” his
Iather said. “A  Slanet’s liIe is a vast, tiJhtly  interwoven  Iabric. VeJetation
and animal chanJes will be  determined at Iirst by  the raw Shysical Iorces
we maniSulate. As  they  establish themselves, thouJh,  our  chanJes will
become controllinJ inIluences in their own riJht—and  we will  have to deal
with them, too. KeeS in mind,  thouJh, that we need control only  three Ser
cent oI the enerJy surIace—only three Ser cent—to tiS the entire structure
over into our selI-sustaininJ system.”
   Why aren’t you helping  me? Kynes wondered. Always the same: when I
need you most, you fail   me. He wanted to  turn  his head, to  stare in  the
direction oI his Iather’s  voice, stare the old man down. Muscles reIused to
answer his demand.
   Kynes  saw the hawk move. It aSSroached his hand, a cautious steS at a
time while its  comSanions waited in mock indiIIerence. The hawk stoSSed
only a hoS away Irom his hand.
   A  SroIound clarity Iilled  Kynes’ mind. He saw Tuite suddenly a Sotential
Ior  Arrakis  that  his  Iather had  never seen. The  Sossibilities  alonJ  that

311
diIIerent Sath Ilooded throuJh him.
   “No  more terrible  disaster could beIall your SeoSle than Ior them to Iall
into the hands oI a Hero,” his Iather said.
   Reading my mind! Kynes thouJht. Well … let him.
   The messages already have been sent to my sietch villages, he thouJht.
Nothing can stop them. If the Duke’s son is alive they’ll find him and protect
him as I  have commanded. They may discard the woman, his mother, but
they’ll save the boy.
   The  hawk took  one hoS that brouJht  it  within  slashinJ distance oI his
hand.  It   tiSSed  its  head  to   e[amine   the   suSine Ilesh.   AbruStly,   it
straiJhtened, stretched its head uSward and with a  sinJle screech, leaSed
into the air and banked away overhead with its comSanions behind it.
   They’ve come! Kynes thouJht. My Fremen havefoundme!
   Then he heard the sand rumblinJ.
   Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinJuish it immediately Irom the
noises oI worms or other desert liIe. Somewhere beneath him, the Sre-sSice
mass had accumulated enouJh water  and orJanic  matter  Irom  the little
makers, had reached the critical staJe oI wild Jrowth. A JiJantic  bubble oI
carbon dio[ide   was  IorminJ   deeS in  the  sand, heavinJ  uSward  in  an
enormous “blow”  with  a  dust whirlSool  at  its center. It  would  e[chanJe
what had been Iormed deeS in the sand Ior whatever lay on the surIace.
   The hawks circled overhead screechinJ their Irustration. They knew what
was haSSeninJ. Any desert creature would know.
   And I  am a desert creature, Kynes thouJht. You see me, Father? I am a
desert creature.
   He  Ielt  the bubble liIt   him, Ielt  it  break and the  dust whirlSool  enJulI
him, draJJinJ him down into cool  darkness. For a moment, the sensation oI
coolness and the moisture were blessed relieI.  Then, as his  Slanet killed
him, it  occurred to Kynes  that his Iather  and all the  other scientists were
wronJ, that the most Sersistent SrinciSles oI the universe were accident and
error.
   Even the hawks could aSSreciate these Iacts.

312
        Prophecy and prescience—How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered
        Tuestion? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the “wave form” (as Muad‘Dib
        referred to his vision- image and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the
        prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the
        future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or
        decisions as a diamond-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?
                                                    —“PriYate Reflections on Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
  “GET THEIR    water,  ”  the  man   callinJ   out  oI   the  niJht   had  said.  And   Paul
IouJht    down   his   Iear,   Jlanced    at  his   mother.    His   trained    eyes   saw  her
readiness  Ior  battle,  the  waitinJ    whiSsnaS  oI  her muscles.
    “It   would   be  reJrettable   should   we  have  to  destroy  you   out  oI  hand,”   the
voice  above  them  said.
    That’s   the  one  who  spoke   to  us first,    Jessica  thouJht.   There   are  at  least
two  of them—one   to  our  right   and one  on  our  left.
    “CiJnoro     hrobosa   sukares  hin   manJe   la  SchaJavas   doi   me  kamavas   na
beslas lele  Sal  hrobas!”
    It  was  the man  to  their  riJht   callinJ   out  across  the basin.
    To  Paul,  the  words   were  Jibberish,    but  out  oI  her  Bene  Gesserit  traininJ,
Jessica recoJnized    the  sSeech.  It  was  Chakobsa,   one  oI  the  ancient  huntinJ
lanJuaJes,   and  the man  above   them  was  sayinJ   that  SerhaSs these  were  the
stranJers  they  souJht.
    In  the  sudden  silence   that  Iollowed    the  callinJ   voice,   the  hooSwheel   Iace
oI  the  second   moon—Iaintly      ivory   blue—rolled      over  the   rocks  across   the
basin,  briJht   and SeerinJ.
    ScramblinJ     sounds   came  Irom    the  rocks—above     and   to  both   sides  …
dark  motions   in the  moonliJht.    Many   IiJures   Ilowed   throuJh    the shadows.
    A whole   troop!   Paul  thouJht   with   a sudden  SanJ.
    A  tall   man  in  a  mottled   burnoose   steSSed  in  Iront   oI  Jessica.  His   mouth
baIIle   was  thrown    aside   Ior   clear  sSeech,  revealinJ     a heavy   beard   in   the
sideliJht   oI  the  moon,   but  Iace  and eyes  were  hidden   in  the  overhanJ   oI  his
hood.
    “What   have  we  here—Minn  or human?”   he  asked.
    When   Jessica   heard  the  true-banter    in   his  voice,    she  allowed    herselI   a
Iaint  hoSe.  This  was  the  voice  oI  command,    the voice   that  had Iirst   shocked

313
them with its intrusion Irom the niJht.
   “Human,  I warrant,” the man said.
   Jessica sensed rather than saw the kniIe hidden  in a  Iold  oI the  man’s
robe. She Sermitted  herselI one  bitter  reJret  that she  and Paul  had no
shields.
   “Do  you also sSeak?” the man asked.
   Jessica Sut all the royal arroJance at her command into her manner and
voice. ReSly was urJent, but she had not heard enouJh oI  this man to  be
certain she had a reJister on his culture and weaknesses.
   “Who  comes on us like criminals out oI the niJht?” she demanded.
   The burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow
rela[ation that revealed much. The man had Jood control.
   Paul shiIted  away Irom his  mother to seSarate them as tarJets and Jive
each oI them a clearer arena oI action.
   The hooded head turned at Paul’s movement, oSeninJ a wedJe oI Iace to
moonliJht. Jessica saw a sharS nose, one JlintinJ eye—dark,  so dark the
eye, without any white in it—a heavy brown and uSturned mustache.
   “A  likely  cub,” the man said. “II you’re  IuJitives Irom the Harkonnens, it
may be you’re welcome amonJ us. What is it, boy?”
   The Sossibilities Ilashed throuJh Paul’s mind: A trick? A fact? Immediate
decision was needed.
   “Why  should you welcome IuJitives?” he demanded.
   “A   child  who thinks  and sSeaks like a man,” the  tall man  said. “Well,
now, to answer your Tuestion, my younJ wali, I  am one who does not Say
the Iai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why I miJht welcome a
IuJitive.”
   He knows who we are, Paul thouJht. There’s concealment in his voice.
   “I   am StilJar,  the  Fremen,” the  tall  man said.  “Does that  sSeed your
tonJue, boy?”
   It  is the same voice, Paul thouJht. And he remembered the Council with
this man seekinJ the body oI a Iriend slain by the Harkonnens.
   “I  know  you, StilJar,”  Paul said. “I was with my  Iather in Council  when
you came Ior the water oI your Iriend. You took away with you my Iather’s
man, Duncan Idaho—an e[chanJe oI Iriends.”
   “And  Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke,” StilJar said.
   Jessica heard the shadinJ oI disJust in his voice, held herselI SreSared Ior
attack.

314
   The voice Irom the rocks above them called: “We waste time here, Stil.”
   “This  is the Duke’s son,” StilJar barked. “He’s certainly the one Liet told
us to seek.”
   “But  … a child, Stil.”
   “The  Duke was a man and this lad  used a thumSer,” StilJar said. “That
was a brave crossinJ he made in the Sath oI shai-hulud.”
   And  Jessica heard him e[cludinJ her Irom  his thouJhts. Had he already
Sassed sentence?
   “We haven’t time Ior  the test,” the voice above them Srotested.
   “Yet  he could be the Lisan al-Gaib,” StilJar said.
   He’s looking for an omen! Jessica thouJht.
   “But  the woman,” the voice above them said.
   Jessica readied herselI anew. There had been death in that voice.
   “Yes, the woman,” StilJar said. “And  her water.”
   “You  know  the law,”  said the voice Irom  the rocks. “Ones  who cannot
live with the desert—”
   “Be  Tuiet,” StilJar said. “Times chanJe.”
   “Did  Liet  command this?” asked the voice Irom the rocks.
   “You  heard the voice oI  the cielaJo, Jamis,” StilJar  said. “Why  do you
Sress me?”
   And   Jessica thouJht:  Cielago!  the  clue  oI   the  tonJue  oSened wide
avenues oI understandinJ:  this  was the  lanJuaJe oI  Ilm   and FiTh,  and
cielaJo meant bat, a small IlyinJ   mammal. Voice of the cielago: they  had
received a distrans messaJe to seek Paul and herselI.
   “I   but remind  you oI  your duties, Iriend  StilJar,”  said the  voice above
them.
   “My  duty  is the strenJth oI the tribe,” StilJar said. “That is my only duty.
I need no one to remind me oI  it.  This child-man interests me. He is  Iull-
Ileshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away Irom the Iather sun.
He has not the eyes oI the ibad. Yet he does not sSeak or act like a weaklinJ
oI the Sans. Nor did his Iather. How can this be?”
   “We  cannot  stay out  here all  niJht  arJuinJ,”  said  the voice  Irom  the
rocks. “II a Satrol—”
   “I  will  not tell you aJain, Jamis, to be Tuiet,” StilJar said.
   The  man above them  remained silent,  but Jessica heard him  movinJ,
crossinJ by a  leaS over a deIile  and workinJ  his  way down  to the basin
Iloor on their leIt.

315
   “The  voice oI the cielaJo suJJested there’d be value to us in savinJ you
two,” StilJar said. “I  can see Sossibility in this stronJ boy-man : he is younJ
and can learn. But what oI yourselI, woman?” He stared at Jessica.
   I  have  his voice  and pattern  registered now, Jessica thought.  I  could
control him with  a word, but  he’s a strong man … worth much more to us
unblunted and with full freedom of action. We shall see.
   “I  am  the mother oI this boy,”  Jessica said. “In Sart, his strenJth which
you admire is the Sroduct oI my traininJ.”
   “The  strenJth oI a woman can be boundless,” StilJar said. “Certain  it is
in a Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?”
   For  the  moment,  Jessica Sut aside  the imSlications  oI   the Tuestion,
answered truthIully, “No.”
   “Are  you trained in the ways oI the desert?”
   “No,  but many consider my traininJ valuable.”
   “We make our own MudJments on value,” StilJar said.
   “Every  man has the riJht to his own MudJments,” she said.
   “It  is well  that you see the reason,” StilJar said. “We cannot dally here to
test you, woman. Do you understand? We’d not want your shade to SlaJue
us. I will   take the boy-man, your son, and he shall have my  countenance,
sanctuary in  my   tribe.  But  Ior   you,  woman—you  understand there  is
nothinJ Sersonal in this? It is the rule, Istislah, in the Jeneral interest. Is that
not enouJh?”
   Paul took a halI-steS Iorward. “What are you talkinJ about?”
   StilJar  Ilicked   a Jlance across Paul, but  keSt his  attention on Jessica.
“Unless you’ve  been deeS-trained Irom childhood to live  here, you could
brinJ destruction  onto an entire  tribe. It  is  the law,  and we cannot carry
useless….”
   Jessica’s motion started as a slumSinJ, deceStive Iaint to the Jround. It
was the obvious thinJ Ior  a weak outworlder to do, and the obvious slows
an oSSonent’s reactions. It takes an instant to interSret a known thinJ when
that thinJ  is e[Sosed as somethinJ  unknown. She shiIted  as she saw his
riJht shoulder droS to brinJ a weaSon within the Iolds oI his robe to bear on
her new Sosition. A turn,  a slash oI her arm, a whirlinJ  oI  minJled robes,
and she was aJainst the rocks with the man helSless in Iront oI her.
   At  his mother’s Iirst  movement, Paul backed two steSs. As she attacked,
he dove Ior  shadows. A bearded man rose uS in  his Sath, halI-crouched,
lunJinJ Iorward with  a weaSon in one hand. Paul took the man beneath the

316
sternum with a straiJht-hand Mab, sidesteSSed and choSSed the base oI his
neck, relievinJ him oI the weaSon as he Iell.
   Then  Paul was into the  shadows, scramblinJ uSward amonJ the rocks,
the weaSon tucked into his waist sash. He had recoJnized it in sSite oI its
unIamiliar shaSe—a SroMectile weaSon, and that said many thinJs about this
Slace, another clue that shields were not used here.
   They  will  concentrate on  my mother  and that  Stilgar  fellow.  She can
handle him. I  must get to a safe vantage point where I  can threaten them
and give her time to escape.
   There  came a chorus oI sharS sSrinJ-clicks Irom  the  basin. ProMectiles
whined  oII  the  rocks  around  him.  One  oI  them  Ilicked   his  robe.  He
sTueezed around a corner in the rocks, Iound himselI in a narrow  vertical
crack, beJan inchinJ uSward—his back aJainst one side, his Ieet aJainst the
other—slowly, as silently as he could.
   The   roar   oI   StilJar’s   voice   echoed uS   to   him:   “Get   back,  you
wormheaded lice! She’ll break my neck iI you come near!”
   A  voice out oI the basin said: “The boy Jot away, Stil. What are we—”
   “OI  course he Jot away, you sand-brained … UJh-h-h! Easy, woman!”
   “Tell  them to stoS huntinJ my son,” Jessica said.
   “They’ve   stoSSed, woman. He Jot away as you intended him to.  Great
Jods below!   Why  didn’t   you  say you  were  a  weirdinJ  woman  and  a
IiJhter?”
   “Tell  your  men to Iall  back,” Jessica said. “Tell them to  Jo out into  the
basin where I can see them …  and you’d  better believe that I  know how
many oI them there are.”
   And  she thouJht: This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp-
minded as I think him, we have a chance.
   Paul inched  his way  uSward, Iound a narrow ledJe  on which  he could
rest and look down into the basin. StilJar’s voice came uS to him.
   “And  iI  I reIuse? How can you … uJh-h-h!  Leave be, woman! We mean
no harm to you, now. Great Jods! II  you can do this to the stronJest oI us,
you’re worth ten times your weiJht oI water.”
   Now,  the test of  reason, Jessica thouJht. She said: “You  ask  aIter the
Lisan al-Gaib.”
   “You  could be the Iolk oI the leJend,” he said, “but I’ll  believe that when
it’s been tested. All I know now is that you came here with that stuSid Duke

317
who…. Aiee-e-e! Woman! I care not iI  you kill  me! He was honorable and
brave, but it was stuSid to Sut himselI in the way oI the Harkonnen Iist!”
   Silence.
   Presently, Jessica said: “He had no choice, but we’ll   not arJue it. Now,
tell that man oI yours behind the bush over there to stoS tryinJ to brinJ his
weaSon to bear on me, or I’ll rid the universe oI you and take him ne[t.”
   “You  there!” StilJar roared. “Do as she says!”
   “But,  Stil—”
   “Do  as she says, you wormIaced, crawlinJ, sand-brained Siece oI lizard
turd! Do it  or I’ll   helS her dismember you! Can’t you see the worth oI this
woman?”
   The man at the bush straiJhtened Irom his  Sartial concealment, lowered
his weaSon.
   “He  has obeyed,” StilJar said.
   “Now,”   Jessica said, “e[Slain clearly to your SeoSle what it is you  wish
oI me. I want no younJ hothead to make a Ioolish mistake.”
   “When  we  sliS into  the  villaJes and  towns we  must mask our  oriJin,
blend with the  San and Jraben Iolk,” StilJar  said. “We  carry no weaSons,
Ior the cryskniIe is  sacred. But you, woman, you have the weirdinJ ability
oI battle. We’d  only  heard oI it  and many doubted, but one cannot doubt
what he sees with his own eyes. You mastered an armed Fremen. This is a
weaSon no search could e[Sose.”
   There was a stirrinJ in the basin as StilJar’s words sank home.
   “And  iI  I aJree to teach you the … weirdinJ way?”
   “My  countenance Ior you as well as your son.”
   “How  can we be sure oI the truth in your Sromise?”
   StilJar’s  voice lost some oI its subtle undertone oI reasoninJ, took on an
edJe oI bitterness. “Out here, woman, we carry no SaSer Ior contracts. We
make no eveninJ Sromises to be broken at dawn. When a man says a thinJ,
that’s the contract. As  leader oI my  SeoSle, I’ve Sut them in  bond to my
word. Teach us this weirdinJ way and you have sanctuary with us as lonJ as
you wish. Your water shall minJle with our water.”
   “Can you sSeak Ior all Fremen?” Jessica asked.
   “In  time,  that may be. But only my  brother, Liet, sSeaks Ior all Fremen.
Here, I Sromise only secrecy. My SeoSle will not sSeak oI you to any other
sietch. The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in Iorce  and your Duke  is

318
dead. It is said that you  two died in  a Mother  storm. The hunter does not
seek dead Jame.”
   There’s a  safety in  that,  Jessica thouJht. But  these people have good
communications and a message could be sent.
   “I  Sresume there was a reward oIIered Ior us,” she said.
   StilJar  remained silent,  and she could almost  see the thouJhts turninJ
over in his head, sensinJ the shiIts oI his muscles beneath her hands.
   Presently, he said: “I  will  say it  once more: I’ve Jiven  the tribe’s word-
bond. My SeoSle know your worth to us now. What could  the Harkonnens
Jive us? Our Ireedom? Hah! no, you are the taTwa, that which buys us more
than all the sSice in the Harkonnen coIIers.”
   “Then  I shall  teach you my way oI  battle,” Jessica said, and she sensed
the unconscious ritual-intensity oI her own words.
   “Now,  will  you release me?”
   “So  be it,”  Jessica said. She released her hold on him, steSSed aside in
Iull view  oI the bank in the basin. This is the test-mashed, she thouJht. But
Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.
   In  the waitinJ silence, Paul inched Iorward to Jet a better view oI  where
his mother stood. As he moved, he heard heavy breathinJ, suddenly stilled,
above him in the vertical crack oI the rock, and sensed a Iaint shadow there
outlined aJainst the stars.
   StilJar’s  voice came uS Irom the basin: “You, uS there! StoS huntinJ the
boy. He’ll come down Sresently.”
   The  voice oI  a younJ  boy  or a  Jirl  sounded Irom  the darkness above
Paul: “But, Stil, he can’t be Iar Irom—”
   “I  said leave him be, Chani! You sSawn oI a lizard!”
   There came a whisSered imSrecation Irom above Paul and a low voice:
“Call me sSawn oI a lizard!” But the shadow Sulled back out oI view.
   Paul returned his  attention to the basin, SickinJ  out the  Jray-shadowed
movement oI StilJar beside his mother.
   “Come  in, all oI you,”  StilJar called. He turned to Jessica. “And now I’ll
ask you how  we  may be  certain you’ll   IulIill   your  halI  oI  our barJain?
You’re the one’s lived with SaSers and emSty contracts and such as—”
   “We  oI the Bene Gesserit don’t break our vows any more than you do,”
Jessica said.
   There  was a Srotracted silence, then  a multiSle  hissinJ  oI  voices: “A
Bene Gesserit witch!”

319
   Paul brouJht  his caStured weaSon Irom his sash, trained it on  the dark
IiJure  oI  StilJar,  but  the man  and his  comSanions remained immobile,
starinJ at Jessica.
   “It  is the leJend,” someone said.
   “It   was said that  the Shadout MaSes Jave this reSort  on you,”  StilJar
said. “But a thinJ so imSortant must be tested. II you are the Bene Gesserit
oI the leJend whose son will lead us to Saradise….” He shruJJed.
   Jessica siJhed,  thinkinJ:  So  our  Missionaria  Protectiva  even planted
religious safety valves all through this hell  hole. Ah, well … it’ll   help, and
that’s what it was meant to do.
   She said: “The seeress who brouJht you the leJend, she Jave it under the
bindinJ  oI   karama and  iMaz, the  miracle  and  the  inimitability    oI  the
SroShecy—this I know. Do you wish a siJn?”
   His  nostrils Ilared  in the  moonliJht. “We  cannot tarry Ior  the rites,”  he
whisSered.
   Jessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranJinJ emerJency
escaSe routes. How lonJ  aJo it   seemed. There had been a Slace called
“Sietch Tabr” on the chart and beside it the notation: “StilJar.”
   “PerhaSs when we Jet to Sietch Tabr,” she said.
   The revelation shook him, and Jessica thouJht: If only he knew the tricks
we use!  She must’ve been good,  that  Bene Gesserit of  the Missionaria
Protectiva. These Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.
   StilJar  shiIted uneasily. “We must Jo now.”
   She nodded, lettinJ him know that they leIt with her Sermission.
   He  looked uS at  the cliII  almost  directly at  the rock  ledJe where Paul
crouched. “You  there, lad:  you  may come  down now.”  He  returned his
attention to  Jessica, sSoke with an  aSoloJetic tone: “Your   son made an
incredible amount oI noise climbinJ. He has much to learn lest he endanJer
us all, but he’s younJ.”
   “No  doubt we have much to teach each other,” Jessica said. “Meanwhile,
you’d best see to your comSanion out there. My noisy son was a bit rouJh
in disarminJ him.”
   StilJar  whirled, his hood IlaSSinJ. “Where?”
   “Beyond  those bushes.” She Sointed.
   StilJar   touched  two   oI   his  men.   “See  to   it.”   He   Jlanced  at  his
comSanions, identiIyinJ  them. “Jamis  is missinJ.”   He turned  to Jessica.
“Even your cub knows the weirdinJ way.”

320
   “And   you’ll   notice  that  my  son hasn’t  stirred  Irom  uS there  as you
ordered,” Jessica said.
   The two  men StilJar had sent returned suSSortinJ a third who stumbled
and JasSed between them. StilJar Jave them a IlickinJ Jlance, returned his
attention to  Jessica. “The son will   take only  your  orders, eh? Good. He
knows disciSline.”
   “Paul, you may come down now,” Jessica said.
   Paul  stood  uS, emerJinJ  into   moonliJht  above  his  concealinJ  cleIt,
sliSSed the Fremen weaSon back into his sash. As he turned, another IiJure
arose Irom the rocks to Iace him.
   In  the moonliJht and reIlection oII Jray  stone, Paul saw a small IiJure in
Fremen robes, a shadowed Iace SeerinJ out at him Irom the hood, and the
muzzle oI one oI the SroMectile weaSons aimed at him Irom a Iold oI robe.
   “I  am Chani, dauJhter oI Liet.”
   The voice was liltinJ,  halI Iilled  with lauJhter.
   “I  would not have Sermitted you to harm my comSanions,” she said.
   Paul swallowed.  The IiJure in  Iront  oI him  turned into the moon’s Sath
and he saw an elIin Iace, black Sits oI eyes. The Iamiliarity oI that Iace, the
Ieatures out oI numberless visions in his earliest Srescience, shocked Paul
to stillness.  He remembered the anJry  bravado with  which  he had  once
described this Iace-Irom-a-dream, tellinJ the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
Mohiam: “I  will  meet her.”
   And  here was the Iace, but in no meetinJ he had ever dreamed.
   “You  were as noisy as shai-hulud in a raJe,” she said. “And you took the
most diIIicult way uS here. Follow me; I’ll  show you an easier way down.”
   He scrambled out oI the cleIt,  Iollowed the swirlinJ  oI  her robe across a
tumbled landscaSe. She moved like a Jazelle, dancinJ over the rocks. Paul
Ielt hot blood in his Iace, was thankIul Ior the darkness.
   That girl!  She was like a touch oI destiny. He Ielt cauJht uS on a wave, in
tune with a motion that liIted all his sSirits.
   They stood Sresently amidst the Fremen on the basin Iloor.
   Jessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but sSoke to StilJar: “This  will  be a
Jood e[chanJe oI  teachinJs. I hoSe you and your SeoSle Ieel no anJer at
our  violence.  It  seemed …  necessary. You  were  about to   …  make  a
mistake.”
   “To   save one Irom  a  mistake is  a  JiIt  oI  Saradise,” StilJar  said.  He
touched his liSs with his leIt hand, liIted the weaSon Irom Paul’s waist with

321
the other, tossed it to a comSanion. “You will have your own maula Sistol,
lad, when you’ve earned it.”
   Paul  started to  sSeak, hesitated, rememberinJ  his  mother’s  teachinJ:
“Beginnings are such delicate times. ”
   “My   son has what weaSons he needs,” Jessica said. She stared at StilJar,
IorcinJ him to think oI  how Paul had acTuired the Sistol.
   StilJar  Jlanced at the man Paul had subdued—Jamis. The man stood at
one side, head lowered, breathinJ  heavily. “You  are  a diIIicult   woman,”
StilJar said. He held out his leIt  hand to a comSanion, snaSSed his IinJers.
“Kushti bakka te.”
   More Chakobsa, Jessica thouJht.
   The comSanion Sressed two sTuares oI Jauze into StilJar’s hand. StilJar
ran them throuJh his IinJers,  Ii[ed  one around Jessica’s neck beneath her
hood, Iitted the other around Paul’s neck in the same way.
   “Now   you  wear the  kerchieI  oI  the  bakka,”  he said.  “II   we become
seSarated, you will be recoJnized as belonJinJ to StilJar’s sietch. We will
talk oI weaSons another time.”
   He  moved  out throuJh  his  band now,  insSectinJ them,  JivinJ   Paul’s
Fremkit Sack to one oI his men to carry.
   Bakka,   Jessica thouJht,  recoJnizinJ   the  reliJious   term:   bakka—the
weeper. She sensed how the symbolism oI the kerchieIs united this  band.
Why should weeping unite them? she asked herselI.
   StilJar  came to the younJ Jirl  who  had embarrassed Paul, said: “Chani,
take the child-man under your winJ. KeeS him out oI trouble.”
   Chani touched Paul’s arm. “Come alonJ, child-man.”
   Paul hid the anJer in his voice, said: “My  name is Paul. It were well you
—”
   “We’ll  Jive  you a name, manlinJ,” StilJar said, “in the time oI the mihna,
at the test oI aTl.”
   The  test  of   reason,  Jessica translated.  The  sudden need  oI   Paul’s
ascendancy overrode all other consideration, and  she barked, “My   son’s
been tested with the Jom Mabbar!”
   In  the stillness  that Iollowed,  she knew  she had struck to  the heart oI
them.
   “There’s  much we don’t know oI each other,” StilJar said. “But  we tarry
overlonJ. Day-sun mustn’t Iind us in the oSen.” He crossed to the man Paul
had struck down, said, “Jamis, can you travel?”

322
   A  Jrunt  answered him. “SurSrised me, he did. ’Twas an accident. I can
travel.”
   “No  accident,” StilJar  said. “I’ll  hold you  resSonsible with Chani Ior the
lad’s saIety, Jamis. These SeoSle have my countenance.”
   Jessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had arJued with
StilJar Irom  the rocks. His was the voice with  death in it. And  StilJar had
seen Iit to reinIorce his order with this Jamis.
   StilJar  Ilicked  a testinJ Jlance across the JrouS, motioned two men out.
“Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See that we leave no trace.
E[tra  care—we have two  with  us  who’ve  not been trained.”  He  turned,
hand uSheld and aimed across the basin. “In   sTuad line with  Ilankers—
move out. We must be at Cave oI the RidJes beIore dawn.”
   Jessica Iell  into  steS beside StilJar,  countinJ  heads. There were Iorty
Fremen—she and Paul made it Iorty-two. And she thouJht: They travel as a
military company—eventhe girl, Chani.
   Paul took  a Slace in the line  behind Chani. He had Sut down the  black
IeelinJ at beinJ cauJht by the Jirl. In  his mind now was the memory called
uS by his mother’s barked reminder: “My   son’s been tested with the Jom
Mabbar!” He Iound that his hand tinJled with remembered Sain.
   “Watch  where you Jo,”  Chani hissed. “Do not  brush aJainst a bush lest
you leave a thread to show our SassaJe.”
   Paul swallowed, nodded.
   Jessica listened to the sounds oI the trooS, hearinJ her own IootsteSs and
Paul’s, marvelinJ at  the way the  Fremen moved. They were Iorty  SeoSle
crossinJ the  basin  with  only   the sounds  natural to   the Slace—Jhostly
Ieluccas, their  robes IlittinJ   throuJh the  shadows. Their  destination was
Sietch Tabr—StilJar’s sietch.
   She turned the word  over in her mind:  sietch. It  was a Chakobsa word,
unchanJed Irom the old huntinJ lanJuaJe out oI countless centuries. Sietch:
a meetinJ Slace in time oI  danJer. The SroIound imSlications oI the word
and the lanJuaJe were Must beJinninJ to reJister with her aIter the tension oI
their encounter.
   “We move well,”  StilJar said. “With  Shai-hulud’s Iavor, we’ll reach Cave
oI the RidJes beIore dawn.”
   Jessica nodded, conservinJ her strenJth, sensinJ the terrible IatiJue she
held at bay by Iorce oI will  … and, she admitted it: by the Iorce oI elation.

323
Her mind Iocused on the value oI this trooS, seeinJ what was revealed here
about the Fremen culture.
   All  of them, she thouJht, an entire culture trained to military order. What
a priceless thing is hereforan outcast Duke!

324
        The Fremen were supreme in that Tuality the ancients called “spannungsbogen” —which is
        the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that
        thing.
                                                  —from “The Wisdom of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  THEY APPROACHED   Cave oI  the RidJes  at  dawnbreak, movinJ   throuJh
a sSlit in  the basin wall  so  narrow they  had to  turn sideways  to neJotiate  it.
Jessica saw  StilJar   detach Juards   in  the  thin  dawnliJht,    saw them   Ior  a
moment as they beJan their  scramblinJ  climb  uS the cliII.
    Paul  turned  his  head uSward  as  he walked,   seeinJ  the  taSestry oI  this
Slanet cut im  cross  section where  the  narrow  cleIt  JaSed toward  Jray-blue
sky.
    Chani Sulled  at his robe to hurry  him,  said: “Quickly.   It  is already  liJht.”
    “The   men    who   climbed    above   us,   where   are   they   JoinJ?”    Paul
whisSered.
    “The  Iirst  daywatch,”  she said. “Hurry   now!”
    A guard  left  outside, Paul  thouJht.  Wise. But  it  would’ve  been wiser  still
for  us to approach   this place  in  separate  bands. Less chance  of  losing  the
whole  troop.  He   Saused in  the  thouJht,   realizinJ   that   this  was  Juerrilla
thinkinJ,   and   he  remembered  his   Iather’s   Iear  that   the  Atreides   miJht
become a Juerrilla  house.
    “Faster,”  Chani whisSered.
    Paul sSed his steSs, hearinJ the swish  oI robes behind.  And  he thouJht  oI
the words oI  the sirat Irom  Yueh’s tiny  O.C.  Bible.
    “Paradise   on my right,   Hell  on my  left and  the Angel  of Death  behind.  ”
He rolled  the Tuotation in  his mind.
    They  rounded a  corner where  the  SassaJe widened. StilJar   stood at  one
side motioninJ  them  into a low  hole that  oSened at riJht anJles.
    “Quickly!”    he hissed.  “We’re  like  rabbits  in  a caJe iI  a Satrol  catches us
here.”
    Paul bent Ior  the oSeninJ,  Iollowed  Chani  into  a cave illuminated   by thin
Jray liJht  Irom  somewhere  ahead.
    “You  can stand uS,” she said.
    He  straiJhtened,  studied   the Slace:  a  deeS and  wide  area  with   domed
ceilinJ  that  curved  away  Must out oI  a man’s  handreach. The  trooS  sSread

325
out throuJh shadows. Paul saw his mother come uS on one side, saw her
e[amine their comSanions. And he noted how she Iailed to blend with  the
Fremen even thouJh her Jarb was identical. The way she moved —such a
sense oI Sower and Jrace.
   “Find  a  Slace to rest and stay out  oI  the way, child-man,”  Chani said.
“Here’s Iood.”  She Sressed two leaI-wraSSed morsels into his hand. They
reeked oI sSice.
   StilJar  came uS behind Jessica, called an order to  a JrouS on  the leIt.
“Get  the doorseal in  Slace and  see to  moisture security.”  He  turned  to
another Fremen: “Lemil, Jet JlowJlobes.” He took Jessica’s arm. “I wish to
show you somethinJ, weirdinJ woman.” He led her around a curve oI rock
toward the liJht source.
   Jessica Iound herselI lookinJ out across the wide liS oI  another oSeninJ
to the cave, an  oSeninJ hiJh  in a  cliII  wall—lookinJ   out  across another
basin about ten or twelve kilometers wide. The basin was shielded by hiJh
rock walls. SSarse clumSs oI Slant Jrowth were scattered around it.
   As   she looked  at  the  dawn-Jray  basin,  the  sun  liIted   over  the  Iar
escarSment illuminatinJ a biscuit-colored landscaSe oI rocks and sand. And
she noted how the sun oI Arrakis aSSeared to leaS over the horizon.
   It’s because we want to hold it back, she thouJht. Night is safer than day.
There came over her then a lonJinJ Ior a rainbow  in this Slace that would
never see rain.  I  must  suppress such longings,  she thouJht.  They’re  a
weakness. I no longer can afford weaknesses.
   StilJar  JriSSed her arm, Sointed across the basin. “There! There you see
SroSer Druses.”
   She looked where he Sointed, saw movement: SeoSle on the basin Iloor
scatterinJ at the dayliJht into the shadows oI the oSSosite cliIIwall. In sSite
oI the distance, their movements were Slain in the clear air. She liIted  her
binoculars Irom  beneath her  robe, Iocused the  oil  lenses on  the distant
SeoSle. KerchieIs Iluttered like a IliJht oI multicolored butterIlies.
   “That  is  home,”  StilJar  said. “We  will  be  there this niJht.”   He stared
across the basin, tuJJinJ at his mustache. “My  SeoSle stayed out overlate
workinJ. That  means there are no Satrols about. I’ll siJnal  them later and
they’ll SreSare Ior us.”
   “Your   SeoSle show  Jood  disciSline,”  Jessica said.  She  lowered  the
binoculars, saw that StilJar was lookinJ at them.

326
   “They  obey  the Sreservation oI  the tribe,”  he  said. “It   is the  way we
choose amonJ us Ior a leader. The leader is the one who is  stronJest, the
one who brinJs water and security.” He liIted his attention to her Iace.
   She returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyeSits, the
dust-rimmed beard and mustache, the line oI  the catchtube curvinJ down
Irom his nostrils into his stillsuit.
   “Have   I  comSromised your  leadershiS by  bestinJ  you,  StilJar?”  she
asked.
   “You  did not call me out,” he said.
   “It’s  imSortant that a leader keeS the resSect oI his trooS,” she said.
   “Isn’t   a one oI those sandlice I cannot handle,” StilJar said. “When  you
bested me, you bested us all.  Now,  they hoSe to  learn Irom  you  …  the
weirdinJ way … and some are curious to see iI you intend to call me out.”
   She weiJhed the imSlications. “By bestinJ you in Iormal battle?”
   He  nodded. “I’d  advise you aJainst this because they’d not Iollow  you.
You’re not oI the sand. They saw this in our niJht’s SassaJe.”
   “Practical SeoSle,” she said.
   “True  enouJh.” He  Jlanced at the basin. “We  know our  needs. But not
many are thinkinJ deeS thouJhts now this close to  home. We’ve been out
overlonJ arranJinJ  to  deliver our  sSice Tuota to  the Iree  traders Ior  the
cursed Guild … may their Iaces be Iorever black.”
   Jessica stoSSed in the act oI turninJ away Irom him, looked back uS into
his Iace. “The Guild? What has the Guild to do with your sSice?”
   “It’s  Liet’s  command,” StilJar said. “We know the reason, but the taste oI
it sours us. We bribe the Guild with  a monstrous Sayment in sSice to keeS
our skies clear oI satellites and such that none may sSy what we do to the
Iace oI Arrakis.”
   She weiJhed out her words, rememberinJ that Paul had said this must be
the reason Arrakeen skies were clear oI satellites. “And what is it you do to
the Iace oI Arrakis that must not be seen?”
   “We  chanJe it …  slowly  but with  certainty …  to make it  Iit  Ior human
liIe.  Our  Jeneration will   not  see it,  nor our  children  nor  our  children’s
children nor  the Jrandchildren oI  their children  …  but it  will   come.” He
stared with veiled eyes out over the basin. “OSen water and tall Jreen Slants
and SeoSle walkinJ Ireely without stillsuits.”
   So that’s the dream of this Liet-Kynes, she thouJht. And she said: “Bribes
are danJerous; they have a way oI JrowinJ larJer and larJer.”

327
   “They  Jrow,” he said, “but the slow way is the saIe way.”
   Jessica turned, looked out over the basin, tryinJ to see it the way StilJar
was seeinJ it in his imaJination.  She saw only the Jrayed mustard stain oI
distant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliIIs.
   “Ah-h-h-h,”   StilJar said.
   She thouJht  at Iirst  it  must  be a Satrol vehicle,  then realized it  was a
miraJe—another landscaSe hoverinJ  over the  desert-sand and a  distant
waverinJ oI Jreenery and in the middle distance a lonJ worm travelinJ  the
surIace with what looked like Fremen robes IlutterinJ on its back.
   The miraJe Iaded.
   “It  would  be better to ride,” StilJar  said, “but we cannot Sermit a maker
into this basin. Thus, we must walk aJain toniJht.”
   Maker—theirword  for worm, she thouJht.
   She measured the imSort oI his words, the statement that they could not
Sermit a worm into this basin. She knew what she had seen in the miraJe—
Fremen ridinJ on  the back oI  a Jiant  worm. It  took  heavy control  not to
betray her shock at the imSlications.
   “We  must be JettinJ  back to the  others,” StilJar  said. “Else my  SeoSle
may susSect I dally with you. Some already are Mealous that my hands tasted
your loveliness when we struJJled last niJht in Tuono Basin.”
   “That  will  be enouJh oI that!” Jessica snaSSed.
   “No  oIIense,”  StilJar  said, and his voice was mild.  “Women  amonJ us
are not taken aJainst their will … and with you….”  He shruJJed. “…  even
that convention isn’t reTuired.”
   “You  will  keeS in mind that I was a duke’s lady,” she said, but her voice
was calmer.
   “As   you wish,”   he said. “It’s   time  to seal oII   this oSeninJ, to  Sermit
rela[ation oI  stillsuit disciSline. My  SeoSle need to rest in comIort this day.
Their Iamilies will  Jive them little rest on the morrow.”
   Silence Iell between them.
   Jessica stared out into the sunliJht. She had heard what she had heard in
StilJar’s voice—the  unsSoken oIIer oI more than his countenance. Did he
need a wiIe? She realized she could steS into that Slace with him. It would
be one way to end conIlict over tribal  leadershiS—Iemale SroSerly aliJned
with male.
   But  what  oI  Paul then? Who  could  tell  yet  what rules  oI  Sarenthood
Srevailed here? And what oI the unborn dauJhter she had carried these Iew

328
weeks? What oI a dead Duke’s dauJhter? And she Sermitted herselI to Iace
Iully  the siJniIicance oI this other child JrowinJ  within  her, to see her own
motives in  SermittinJ  the  conceStion. She knew  what  it  was—she  had
succumbed to that SroIound drive  shared by  all creatures who  are Iaced
with  death—the drive to  seek immortality  throuJh  SroJeny. The Iertility
drive oI the sSecies had overSowered them.
   Jessica Jlanced  at StilJar,   saw that  he  was studyinJ  her,  waitinJ.  A
daughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this man—what would
be the fate of such a daughter? she asked herselI. Would he try to limit the
necessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow?
   StilJar  cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some oI
the Tuestions in her mind.  “What  is  imSortant Ior  a leader is that  which
makes him a  leader. It is  the needs oI  his SeoSle. II  you teach me your
Sowers, there may come a day when one oI us must challenJe the other. I
would SreIer some alternative.”
   “There are several alternatives?” she asked.
   “The  Sayyadina,” he said. “Our Reverend Mother is old.”
   Their Reverend Mother!
   BeIore she could Srobe this, he said: “I do not necessarily oIIer myselI as
mate. This  is nothinJ  Sersonal, Ior  you  are beautiIul  and desirable. But
should you become one oI my women, that miJht lead some oI my  younJ
men to believe that I’m too much concerned with Sleasures oI the Ilesh and
not enouJh concerned with the tribe’s needs. Even now they listen to us and
watch us.”
   A  man  who  weighs  his  decisions,  who  thinks  of  conseTuences, she
thouJht.
   “There are those amonJ my younJ men who have reached the aJe oI wild
sSirits,” he said. “They must be eased throuJh this Seriod. I must leave no
Jreat reasons around Ior them to challenJe me.  Because I would  have to
maim and kill  amonJ them. This is  not the SroSer course Ior a leader iI it
can be avoided with   honor. A  leader, you  see, is one oI  the  thinJs that
distinJuishes a mob Irom  a SeoSle. He maintains the level oI individuals.
Too Iew individuals, and a SeoSle reverts to a mob.”
   His  words, the deSth oI their awareness, the Iact that he sSoke as much to
her as to those who secretly listened, Iorced her to reevaluate him.
   He has stature, she thouJht. Where did he learn such inner balance?

329
   “The  law  that  demands our Iorm  oI  choosinJ a  leader is  a Must law,”
StilJar said. “But it  does not Iollow that Mustice is always the thinJ a SeoSle
needs. What we truly need now is time to Jrow  and SrosSer, to sSread our
Iorce over more land.”
   What is his ancestry? she wondered. Whence comes such breeding? She
said: “StilJar, I underestimated you.”
   “Such was my susSicion,” he said.
   “Each oI us aSSarently underestimated the other,” she said.
   “I  should like  an end to this,” he said. “I should like  IriendshiS with you
… and trust. I  should like  that resSect Ior each other which  Jrows in  the
breast without demand Ior the huddlinJs oI se[.”
   “I  understand,” she said.
   “Do  you trust me?”
   “I  hear your sincerity.”
   “AmonJ   us,”  he  said, “the  Sayyadina, when  they are  not  the Iormal
leaders, hold  a sSecial  Slace oI  honor. They  teach.  They  maintain  the
strenJth oI God here.” He touched his breast.
   Now  I must probe this  Reverend Mother mystery, she thouJht. And she
said: “You  sSoke oI your  Reverend Mother  …  and I’ve  heard words  oI
leJend and SroShecy.”
   “It   is  said that a  Bene Gesserit and her oIIsSrinJ  hold  the key  to our
Iuture,” he said.
   “Do  you believe I am that one.”
   She watched his Iace, thinkinJ: The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings
are times of such great peril.
   “We do not know,”  he said.
   She nodded, thinkinJ: He’s an honorable man. He wants a sign from me,
but he’ll not tip fate by telling me the sign.
   Jessica turned  her  head,  stared down   into  the  basin  at  the  Jolden
shadows, the SurSle shadows, the vibrations oI dust-mote air across the liS
oI their cave. Her mind was Iilled suddenly with Ieline Srudence. She knew
the cant oI the Missionaria Protectiva, knew how to adaSt the techniTues oI
leJend and Iear  and hoSe to  her emerJency needs, but  she sensed wild
chanJes here … as thouJh someone had been in amonJ these Fremen and
caSitalized on the Missionaria Protectiva’s imSrint.
   StilJar  cleared his throat.

330
   She sensed his  imSatience, knew that  the day  moved ahead and men
waited to seal oII  this oSeninJ. This  was a time Ior  boldness on her Sart,
and she realized what  she needed: some dar al-hikman,  some school oI
translation that would Jive her….
   “Adab,”  she whisSered.
   Her mind  Ielt as thouJh it had rolled over within  her. She recoJnized the
sensation with  a TuickeninJ  oI  Sulse. NothinJ  in  all  the  Bene Gesserit
traininJ carried such a siJnal oI recoJnition.  It could  be only the adab, the
demandinJ memory that comes uSon you oI itselI. She Jave herselI uS to it,
allowinJ the words to Ilow Irom her.
   “Ibn   Tirtaiba,”  she said,“as Iar  as the sSot where the  dust ends.”  She
stretched out an arm Irom her robe, seeinJ StilJar’s eyes Jo wide. She heard
a rustlinJ oI  many robes in  the backJround. “I  see a …  Fremen with the
book oI  e[amSles,”  she intoned. “He   reads to al-Lat,  the  sun whom  he
deIied and subMuJated. He reads to the Sadus oI the Trial and this is what he
reads:

       “Mine  enemies are like Jreen blades eaten down 
       That did stand in the Sath oI the temSest.           
       Hast thou not seen what our Lord did?    
       He sent the Sestilence amonJ them     
       That did lay schemes aJainst us.    
       They are like birds scattered by the huntsman.  
       Their schemes are like Sellets oI Soison         
       That every mouth reMects.” 

   A  tremblinJ Sassed throuJh her. She droSSed her arm.
   Back to her Irom the inner cave’s shadows came a whisSered resSonse oI
many voices: “Their works have been overturned.”
   “The  Iire oI God mount over thy heart,”  she said. And she thouJht: Now,
it goes in the proper channel.
   “The  Iire oI God set aliJht,” came the resSonse.
   She nodded. “Thine enemies shall Iall,” she said.
   “Bi-la  kaiIa,”  they answered.
   In  the sudden hush, StilJar bowed to  her. “Sayyadina,” he said. “II   the
Shai-hulud Jrant,  then you  may  yet Sass within  to  become a  Reverend
Mother.”

   Pass within, she thouJht. An odd way of putting it. But the rest of it fitted
into the cant well enough. And she Ielt a cynical bitterness at what she had
done. Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails. A place was prepared for us
in this wilderness. The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place.
Now … I  must play the part  of Auliya,  the Friend of  God… Sayyadina to
rogue peoples who’ve been so heavily  imprinted  with  our  Bene Gesserit
soothsay they even call their chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.
   Paul stood beside Chani in the shadows oI the inner cave. He could still
taste the morsel she had Ied him—bird  Ilesh  and Jrain bound  with  sSice
honey and encased in a leaI. In tastinJ  it he had realized he never beIore
had eaten such  a concentration  oI  sSice essence and there had  been a
moment oI  Iear. He knew  what this  essence could do to  him—the spice
change that Sushed his mind into Srescient awareness.
   “Bi-la  kaiIa,”  Chani whisSered.
   He  looked at  her, seeinJ the  awe with  which  the Fremen aSSeared to
acceSt his mother’s words. Only the man called Jamis seemed to stand alooI
Irom  the  ceremony, holdinJ  himselI  aSart with   arms Iolded  across his
breast.
   “Duy   yakha hin  manJe,”  Chani whisSered. “Duy   Sunra hin  manJe. I
have two eyes. I have two Ieet.”
   And  she stared at Paul with a look oI wonder.
   Paul  took  a  deeS breath, tryinJ  to  still   the  temSest within  him.  His
mother’s words had locked onto the workinJ  oI  the sSice essence, and he
had Ielt her voice rise and Iall within  him like  the shadows oI an oSen Iire.
ThrouJh it all,  he had sensed the edJe oI cynicism in her—he knew her so
well!—but  nothinJ  could stoS this thinJ  that had beJun with  a morsel oI
Iood.
   Terrible purpose!
   He sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escaSe. There was
the  sharSened clarity,  the   inIlow   oI   data,  the  cold   Srecision oI   his
awareness. He sank to the Iloor, sittinJ with  his back aJainst rock,  JivinJ
himselI uS  to  it.  Awareness Ilowed into  that  timeless stratum  where he
could view time, sensinJ the available Saths, the winds oI the Iuture … the
winds oI the Sast: the one-eyed vision oI the Sast, the one-eyed vision oI the
Sresent and the one-eyed vision oI the Iuture—all combined in a trinocular
vision that Sermitted him to see time-become-sSace.

332
   There was  danJer, he Ielt, oI  overrunninJ  himselI,  and he had to hold
onto  his  awareness oI   the  Sresent, sensinJ  the  blurred  deIlection   oI
e[Serience, the IlowinJ moment, the continual solidiIication  oI that-which-
is into the SerSetual-was.
   In  JrasSinJ the Sresent, he Ielt Ior the Iirst time the massive steadiness oI
time’s  movement everywhere  comSlicated by   shiItinJ  currents,  waves,
surJes, and countersurJes, like surI aJainst rocky cliIIs. It Jave him  a new
understandinJ oI his Srescience, and he saw the source oI blind time,  the
source oI error in it, with an immediate sensation oI Iear.
   The  Srescience, he realized, was an illumination   that incorSorated the
limits  oI what  it  revealed—at once a source oI  accuracy and meaninJIul
error. A  kind oI  HeisenberJ indeterminacy intervened: the e[Senditure oI
enerJy that revealed what he saw, chanJed what he saw.
   And   what  he saw  was  a  time  ne[us  within   this  cave, a  boilinJ   oI
Sossibilities Iocused here, wherein the most minute action—the wink oI an
eye, a careless word, a misSlaced Jrain oI  sand—moved a JiJantic  lever
across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subMect to so
many variables that  his sliJhtest  movement created vast shiItinJs  in  the
Sattern.
   The  vision made him  want to Ireeze into  immobility,  but this,  too, was
action with its conseTuences.
   The countless conseTuences—lines Ianned out Irom this cave, and alonJ
most oI  these conseTuence-lines he saw his own  dead body with   blood
IlowinJ Irom  a JaSinJ kniIe wound.

333
        My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he encompassed
        the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He seldom appeared in
        public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg’s black helmet with the Imperial
        lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay. He was
        not always that blatant, though. When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I
        often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a
        man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must remember that he
        was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history. But we
        denied him a legal son. Was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother
        obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the
        stronger? History already has answered.
                                                                   —“In  My Father’s House” by the Princess Irulan



 
  JESSICA AWAKENED      in cave  darkness,   sensinJ  the  stir  oI  Fremen  around
her, smellinJ    the  acrid   stillsuit    odor.   Her  inner   timesense   told  her  it  would
soon be  niJht  outside,   but  the  cave remained   in  blackness,   shielded  Irom   the
desert  by   the   Slastic   hoods   that   traSSed  their    body   moisture    within    this
sSace.
    She  realized   that   she had   Sermitted   herselI   the  utterly    rela[inJ     sleeS oI
Jreat   IatiJue,     and    this   suJJested     somethinJ     oI   her    own    unconscious
assessment  on   Sersonal  security    within    StilJar’s     trooS.   She  turned   in   the
hammock   that  had  been  Iashioned    oI  her  robe,  sliSSed  her  Ieet   to  the  rock
Iloor  and  into  her  desert  boots.
    I  must   remember    to  fasten   the   boots  slip-fashion     to   help   my  stillsuit’s
pumping   action,  she  thought.   There  are  so many  things  to  remember.
    She  could   still    taste  their   morninJ    meal—the     morsel   oI   bird   Ilesh   and
Jrain  bound   within   a  leaI  with   sSice honey—and    it  came  to  her  that  the use
oI  time  was  turned   around   here:  niJht   was  the  day  oI  activity    and  day  was
the time  oI  rest.
    Night   conceals;   night  is  safest.
    She  unhooked   her robe  Irom   its  hammock   SeJs  in  a rock  alcove,   Iumbled
with  the  Iabric   in the  dark  until   she Iound   the toS,  sliSSed  into  it.
    How   to   Jet  a  messaJe   out   to  the   Bene  Gesserit?    she  wondered.    They
would  have  to  be told   oI the  two  strays  in  Arrakeen   sanctuary.
    GlowJlobes     came  aliJht    Iarther   into   the   cave.  She  saw   SeoSle  movinJ
there,  Paul  amonJ   them   already  dressed   and  with   his  hood  thrown    back  to
reveal  the aTuiline   Atreides    SroIile.

334
   He  had acted so stranJely beIore they retired,  she thouJht. Withdrawn.
He was like one come back Irom the dead, not yet Iully aware oI his return,
his eyes halI shut and Jlassy with the inward stare. It made her think oI his
warninJ about the sSice-imSreJnated diet: addictive.
   Are there side eIIects? she wondered. He said it had something to do with
his prescient faculty, but he has been strangely silent about what he sees.
   StilJar  came Irom shadows to her riJht, crossed to the JrouS beneath the
JlowJlobes. She marked how he IinJered his  beard and the watchIul, cat-
stalkinJ look oI him.
   AbruSt  Iear shot throuJh Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions
visible in the SeoSle Jathered around Paul—the stiII movements, the ritual
Sositions.
   “They  have my countenance!” StilJar rumbled.
   Jessica recoJnized the man StilJar conIronted—Jamis! She saw then the
raJe in Jamis—the tiJht set oI his shoulders.
   Jamis, the man Paul bested! she thouJht.
   “You  know the rule, StilJar,” Jamis said.
   “Who  knows it better?” StilJar asked, and she heard the tone oI Slacation
in his voice, the attemSt to smooth somethinJ over.
   “I  choose the combat,” Jamis Jrowled.
   Jessica sSed across the cave, JrasSed StilJar’s arm. “What is this?” she
asked.
   “It   is the amtal rule,”  StilJar said. “Jamis is  demandinJ the riJht to  test
your Sart in the leJend.”
   “She must be chamSioned,” Jamis said. “II her chamSion wins, that’s the
truth in it.  But it’s said….”  He Jlanced across the Sress oI SeoSle. “… that
she’d need no chamSion Irom the Fremen—which can mean only that she
brinJs her own chamSion.”
   He’s talking of single combat with Paul! Jessica thouJht.
   She released StilJar’s arm, took a halI-steS Iorward. “I’m always my own
chamSion,” she said. “The meaninJ’s simSle enouJh Ior….”
   “You’ll   not tell  us our ways!”  Jamis snaSSed. “Not without more SrooI
than I’ve  seen. StilJar  could’ve  told   you what  to  say last  morninJ.  He
could’ve Iilled  your mind Iull  oI the coddle and you could’ve bird-talked  it
to us, hoSinJ to make a Ialse way amonJ us.”
   I  can take him, Jessica thought, but that might conflict with the way they
interpret the legend. And  aJain she wondered at the way  the Missionaria

335
Protectiva’s work had been twisted on this Slanet.
   StilJar  looked at Jessica, sSoke in a low voice but one desiJned to carry
to the crowd’s IrinJe. “Jamis  is one to hold a JrudJe, Sayyadina. Your son
bested him and—”
   “It   was an  accident!”  Jamis roared. “There  was witch-Iorce  at  Tuono
Basin and I’ll Srove it now!”
   “…   and I’ve  bested him myselI,”  StilJar  continued. “He  seeks by this
tahaddi challenJe to Jet back at me as well. There’s too much oI violence in
Jamis Ior him ever to make a Jood leader—too much JhaIla, the distraction.
He Jives his mouth to the rules and his heart to the sarIa, the turninJ away.
No,  he could  never  make a  Jood  leader. I’ve  Sreserved him  this  lonJ
because he’s useIul in a IiJht as such, but when he Jets this carvinJ anJer
on him he’s danJerous to his own society.”
   “StilJar-r-r-r!”   Jamis rumbled.
   And  Jessica saw what StilJar was doinJ, tryinJ  to enraJe Jamis, to take
the challenJe away Irom Paul.
   StilJar  Iaced Jamis, and aJain Jessica heard the soothinJ in the rumblinJ
voice. “Jamis, he’s but a boy. He’s—”
   “You  named him a man,” Jamis said. “His mother says he’s been throuJh
the Jom Mabbar. He’s Iull-Ileshed and with a surIeit oI water. The ones who
carried their  Sack say there’s literMons oI water  in  it.  LiterMons! And us
siSSinJ our catch-Sockets the instant they show dew-sSarkle.”
   StilJar  Jlanced at Jessica. “Is this true? Is there water in your Sack?”
   “Yes.”
   “LiterMons oI it?”
   “Two  literMons.”
   “What  was intended with this wealth?”
   Wealth? she thouJht.  She shook  her head, IeelinJ  the  coldness in his
voice.
   “Where  I was born, water Iell Irom the sky and ran over the land in wide
rivers,” she said. “There were oceans oI it  so broad you could not  see the
other shore. I’ve not  been trained to your water  disciSline. I never beIore
had to think oI it this way.”
   A  siJhinJ JasS arose Irom the SeoSle around them: “Water Iell Irom the
sky … it ran over the land.”
   “Did   you know  there’re those amonJ us  who’ve lost  Irom  their catch-
Sockets by accident and will  be in sore trouble beIore we  reach Tabr this

336
niJht?”
   “How   could I  know?” Jessica shook her head. “II  they’re in  need, Jive
them water Irom our Sack.”
   “Is  that what you intended with this wealth?”
   “I  intended it to save liIe,” she said.
   “Then  we acceSt your blessinJ, Sayyadina.”
   “You’ll   not buy  us oII with  water,” Jamis Jrowled. “Nor  will   you anJer
me aJainst yourselI, StilJar. I see you tryinJ to make me call you out beIore
I’ve Sroved my words.”
   StilJar  Iaced  Jamis. “Are  you  determined to Sress this IiJht   aJainst a
child, Jamis?” His voice was low, venomous.
   “She must be chamSioned.”
   “Even  thouJh she has my countenance?”
   “I  invoke the amtal rule,” Jamis said. “It’s my riJht.”
   StilJar  nodded. “Then, iI the boy does not carve you down, you’ll answer
to my  kniIe aIterward.  And this  time I’ll   not  hold back the blade as I’ve
done beIore.”
   “You  cannot do this thinJ,” Jessica said. “Paul’s Must—”
   “You  must not interIere,  Sayyadina,” StilJar said. “Oh,  I  know you can
take me and, thereIore, can take anyone amonJ us, but you cannot best us
all united. This must be; it is the amtal rule.”
   Jessica Iell  silent, starinJ  at him  in  the Jreen liJht   oI the  JlowJlobes,
seeinJ the demoniacal  stiIIness that  had taken over  his  e[Sression. She
shiIted her  attention to  Jamis, saw  the broodinJ  look  to  his  brows  and
thouJht: I should’ve seen that before. He broods. He’s the silent kind,  one
who works himself up inside. I should’ve been prepared.
   “II   you harm my son,” she said, “You’ll  have me to meet. I call  you out
now. I’ll carve you into a Moint oI—”
   “Mother.”  Paul steSSed Iorward, touched her sleeve. “PerhaSs iI I e[Slain
to Jamis how—”
   “E[Slain!”   Jamis sneered.
   Paul Iell  silent, starinJ at the man. He Ielt no Iear oI him. Jamis aSSeared
clumsy  in  his  movements  and  he  had Iallen   so  easily  in  their   niJht
encounter on the sand. But Paul still Ielt the ne[us-boilinJ oI this cave, still
remembered the Srescient visions oI himselI dead under a kniIe. There had
been so Iew avenues oI escaSe Ior him in that vision….
   StilJar  said: “Sayyadina, you must steS back now where—”

337
   “StoS  callinJ  her Sayyadina!” Jamis said. “That’s  yet to  be Sroved. So
she knows the Srayer! What’s that? Every child amonJ us knows it.”
   He  has  talked enough,  Jessica thouJht. I’ve  the  key  to  him.  I  could
immobilize him with a word. She hesitated. But I cannot stop them all.
   “You  will  answer to me then,” Jessica said, and she Sitched her voice in a
twistinJ tone with a little whine in  it and a catch at the end.
   Jamis stared at her, IriJht visible on his Iace.
   “I’ll   teach you aJony,” she said in the same tone. “Remember that as you
IiJht. You’ll  have aJony such as will make the Jom Mabbar a haSSy memory
by comSarison. You will writhe with your entire—”
   “She  tries a sSell on me!”  Jamis JasSed. He Sut his clenched riJht  Iist
beside his ear. “I invoke the silence on her!”
   “So  be it then,” StilJar  said. He cast a warninJ Jlance at Jessica. “II you
sSeak aJain, Sayyadina, we’ll   know  it’s   your  witchcraIt  and  you’ll   be
IorIeit.”  He nodded Ior her to steS back.
   Jessica Ielt hands SullinJ her, helSinJ her back, and she sensed they were
not unkindly. She saw Paul beinJ seSarated Irom the thronJ, the elIin-Iaced
Chani whisSerinJ in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.
   A  rinJ Iormed within  the trooS. More JlowJlobes were brouJht and all oI
them tuned to the yellow band.
   Jamis  steSSed into the rinJ,   sliSSed out oI  his  robe  and tossed it  to
someone in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy Jray slickness oI stillsuit
that was Satched and marked by tucks and Jathers. For a moment, he bent
with his mouth to his shoulder, drinkinJ Irom  a catchSocket tube. Presently
he straiJhtened, Seeled oII and detached the suit, handed it careIully into the
crowd. He stood waitinJ,  clad in  loin-cloth  and some tiJht Iabric over  his
Ieet, a cryskniIe in his riJht hand.
   Jessica saw the Jirl-child  Chani helSinJ Paul, saw her Sress a cryskniIe
handle into his Salm, saw him heIt it, testinJ the weiJht and balance. And it
came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in Srana and bindu, the nerve and
the Iiber—that he had been tauJht IiJhtinJ in  a deadly school, his teachers
men like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were leJends in their
own liIetimes. The boy knew the devious ways oI the Bene Gesserit and he
looked suSSle and conIident.
   But he’s only fifteen, she thouJht. And he has no shield. I must stop this.
Somehow, there must be a way to…. She looked uS, saw StilJar watchinJ
her.

338
   “You  cannot stoS it,” he said. “You must not sSeak.”
   She Sut  a hand over  her mouth,  thinkinJ:  I’ve  planted  fear in  Jamis’
mind. It’ll  slow him some … perhaps. If I could only pray—trulypray.
   Paul stood alone now Must into the rinJ, clad in  the IiJhtinJ  trunks he’d
worn under his stillsuit. He held a cryskniIe in  his riJht hand; his Ieet were
bare aJainst the sand-Jritted rock. Idaho had warned him  time and aJain:
“When  in  doubt of  your  surface, bare  feet are  best. ”   And  there were
Chani’s words oI instruction still  in  the Iront oI  his consciousness: “Jamis
turns to the right  with his  knife after a parry.  It’s a  habit in him  we’ve all
seen. And he’ll aim for the eyes to catch a blink in which to slash you. And
he can fight either hand; look out for a knife shift.”
   But  stronJest in Paul so that he Ielt  it with  his entire body  was traininJ
and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him
day aIter day, hour aIter hour on the Sractice Iloor.
   Gurney Halleck’s words were there to remember: “The good knife fighter
thinks on  point and  blade and  shearing-guard simultaneously. The point
can also cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your
opponent’s blade. ”
   Paul Jlanced at the cryskniIe. There was no shearinJ-Juard; only the slim
round rinJ oI  the handle with its  raised liSs to Srotect the hand. And even
so, he realized that he did not know the breakinJ tension oI this blade, did
not even know iI it could be broken.
   Jamis beJan sidlinJ to the riJht alonJ the edJe oI the rinJ oSSosite Paul.
   Paul  crouched, realizinJ then that  he had no shield, but  was trained to
IiJhtinJ  with  its subtle Iield  around him,  trained to react on  deIense with
utmost sSeed while his attack would  be timed  to the controlled  slowness
necessary Ior SenetratinJ the enemy’s shield. In sSite oI constant warninJ
Irom his trainers not to  deSend on the shield’s mindless bluntinJ oI attack
sSeed, he knew that shield-awareness was Sart oI him.
   Jamis called out in ritual challenJe: “May thy kniIe chiS and shatter!”
   This knife will  break then, Paul thouJht.
   He  cautioned himselI  that Jamis also was without  shield,  but the  man
wasn’t trained to its use, had no shield-IiJhter inhibitions.
   Paul stared across the rinJ at Jamis. The man’s body looked like knotted
whiScord on a dried skeleton. His cryskniIe shone milky yellow in the liJht
oI the JlowJlobes.

339
   Fear coursed throuJh Paul. He Ielt suddenly alone and naked standinJ in
dull  yellow   liJht   within   this   rinJ   oI  SeoSle. Prescience had  Ied   his
knowledJe with  countless e[Seriences, hinted at the stronJest currents oI
the Iuture and the strinJs oI decision that Juided them, but this was the real-
now.  This   was  death  hanJinJ   on   an  inIinite    number  oI   miniscule
mischances.
   AnythinJ  could tiS the Iuture here, he realized. Someone couJhinJ in the
trooS oI watchers, a distraction. A  variation in  a JlowJlobe’s  brilliance,  a
deceStive shadow.
   I’m  afraid, Paul told himselI.
   And  he circled  warily  oSSosite Jamis, reSeatinJ silently to himselI  the
Bene Gesserit litany aJainst Iear. “Fear is the mind-killer….”  It was a cool
bath washinJ over him.  He Ielt  muscles untie themselves, become Soised
and ready.
   “I’ll   sheath my kniIe in your blood,”  Jamis snarled. And in the middle oI
the last word he Sounced.
   Jessica saw the motion, stiIled an outcry.
   Where  the man  struck there was  only  emSty air  and Paul  stood now
behind Jamis with a clear shot at the e[Sosed back.
   Now, Paul! Now! Jessica screamed it in her mind.
   Paul’s  motion was slowly  timed,  beautiIully  Iluid,  but  so slow  it  Jave
Jamis the marJin to twist away, backinJ and turninJ to the riJht.
   Paul withdrew, crouchinJ low. “First,  you must Iind my blood,” he said.
   Jessica recoJnized the shield-IiJhter timinJ  in her son, and it came over
her what a  two-edJed thinJ  that was.  The boy’s  reactions were those oI
youth and trained to a Seak these SeoSle had never seen. But the attack was
trained, too,  and  conditioned by  the  necessities oI  SenetratinJ a  shield
barrier. A   shield  would  reSel  too  Iast  a  blow,  admit  only  the  slowly
deceStive counter. It needed control and trickery to Jet throuJh a shield.
   Does Paul see it? she asked herselI. He must!
   AJain  Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes JlarinJ, his body a yellow blur under
the JlowJlobes.
   And  aJain Paul sliSSed away to return too slowly on the attack.
   And  aJain.
   And  aJain.
   Each time, Paul’s counterblow came an instant late.

340
   And  Jessica saw a thinJ she hoSed Jamis did not see. Paul’s deIensive
reactions were blindinJly  Iast, but  they moved each time at  the Srecisely
correct anJle they would take iI a shield were helSinJ deIlect Sart oI Jamis’
blow.
   “Is  your son SlayinJ with that Soor Iool?” StilJar asked. He waved her to
silence beIore she could resSond. “Sorry; you must remain silent.”
   Now  the  two  IiJures on  the rock  Iloor  circled  each other: Jamis with
kniIe hand held Iar Iorward and tiSSed uS sliJhtly; Paul crouched with kniIe
held low.
   AJain,  Jamis Sounced, and this time he twisted to  the riJht where Paul
had been dodJinJ.
   Instead oI  IakinJ  back and out,  Paul met the  man’s kniIe  hand on the
Soint oI his  own blade. Then the boy  was Jone, twistinJ  away to the leIt
and thankIul Ior Chani’s warninJ.
   Jamis backed into the center oI the circle, rubbinJ his kniIe  hand. Blood
driSSed Irom the inMury Ior a moment,  stoSSed. His eyes were wide and
starinJ—two blue-black  holes—studyinJ Paul with  a new wariness in  the
dull liJht oI  the JlowJlobes.
   “Ah,  that one hurt,” StilJar murmured.
   Paul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do  aIter Iirst
blood, called out: “Do you yield?”
   “Hah!”  Jamis cried.
   An  anJry murmur arose Irom the trooS.
   “Hold!”    StilJar  called out.  “The lad  doesn’t know  our  rule.”  Then, to
Paul: “There can be no yieldinJ  in the tahaddi-challenJe. Death is the test
oI it.”
   Jessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thouJht: He’s never killed a man
like this … in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?
   Paul  circled  slowly  riJht,   Iorced by  Jamis’  movement. The  Srescient
knowledJe oI the  time-boilinJ  variables in this  cave came back to SlaJue
him now.  His  new understandinJ told  him  there  were too  many swiItly
comSressed decisions in this IiJht   Ior  any clear  channel ahead to show
itselI.
   Variable Siled on variable—that was why this cave lay as a blurred ne[us
in his Sath. It was like  a JiJantic rock in  the Ilood, creatinJ maelstroms in
the current around it.
   “Have  an end to it, lad,” StilJar muttered. “Don’t Slay with him.”

341
   Paul creSt Iarther into the rinJ, relyinJ on his own edJe in sSeed.
   Jamis backed now that the realization sweSt over him—that this was no
soIt oIIworlder in the tahaddi rinJ, easy Srey Ior a Fremen cryskniIe.
   Jessica saw the shadow oI desSeration in the man’s Iace. Now  is when
he’s most dangerous, she thought. Now he’s desperate and can do anything.
He sees that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine
born and trained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come
to bloom.
   And  she Iound in herselI a sense oI Sity Ior Jamis—an emotion temSered
by awareness oI the immediate Seril to her son.
   Jamis could do anything … any unpredictable thing, she told herselI. She
wondered then iI  Paul had  JlimSsed this  Iuture, iI  he  were relivinJ   this
e[Serience. But she saw the way her son moved, the beads oI SersSiration
on his  Iace  and  shoulders, the careIul  wariness  visible  in  the  Ilow   oI
muscles. And Ior  the Iirst  time  she sensed, without understandinJ it,  the
uncertainty Iactor in Paul’s JiIt.
   Paul Sressed the IiJht  now, circlinJ  but  not attackinJ. He  had seen the
Iear in  his  oSSonent. Memory oI  Duncan  Idaho’s voice  Ilowed  throuJh
Paul’s awareness: “When your opponent fears you, then’s the moment when
you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become
terror.   The  terrified    man   fights   himself.  Eventually,   he   attacks  in
desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can
be trusted usually to  make a fatal  mistake. You are being trained here to
detect these mistakes and use them.”
   The crowd in the cavern beJan to mutter.
   They think  Paul’s toying with  Jamis, Jessica thouJht. They think Paul’s
being needlessly cruel.
   But   she  sensed  also  the  undercurrent  oI   crowd   e[citement,   their
enMoyment oI the sSectacle. And she could see the Sressure buildinJ uS in
Jamis. The moment when it  became too much Ior  him  to contain was as
aSSarent to her as it was to Jamis … or to Paul.
   Jamis leaSed hiJh, IeintinJ and strikinJ down with his riJht  hand, but the
hand was emSty. The cryskniIe had been shiIted to his leIt hand.
   Jessica JasSed.
   But  Paul had been warned by Chani:  “Jamis  fights with  either hand. ”
And the deSth oI his traininJ had taken in that trick  en passant. “Keep the
mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it, ”   Gurney Halleck had

342
told him time  and aJain. “The knife  is more dangerous than the hand and
the knife can be in either hand. ”
   And  Paul had seen Jamis’ mistake: bad Iootwork so that it took the man a
heartbeat lonJer to  recover  Irom  his  leaS, which  had  been intended to
conIuse Paul and hide the kniIe shiIt.
   E[ceSt  Ior the  low yellow  liJht  oI  the JlowJlobes and the inky  eyes oI
the starinJ trooS, it  was similar to  a session on the Sractice Iloor. Shields
didn’t count where the body’s own movement could be used aJainst it. Paul
shiIted his  own  kniIe  in  a  blurred  motion,  sliSSed sideways and thrust
uSward where Jamis’ chest was descendinJ—then away to watch the man
crumble.
   Jamis Iell  like  a limS  raJ, Iace down,  JasSed once and turned his Iace
toward Paul, then lay still  on the rock  Iloor. His  dead eyes stared out like
beads oI dark Jlass.
   “Killing    with the  point lacks artistry,  ”  Idaho  had once told Paul, “but
don’t let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself. ”
   The trooS rushed Iorward, IillinJ   the rinJ,  SushinJ Paul aside. They hid
Jamis in a Irenzy  oI  huddlinJ activity.  Presently a JrouS oI  them hurried
back into the deSths oI the cavern carryinJ a burden wraSSed in a robe.
   And  there was no body on the rock Iloor.
   Jessica Sressed throuJh toward her son. She Ielt that she swam in a sea oI
robed and stinkinJ backs, a thronJ stranJely silent.
   Now  is the terrible  moment, she thought. He has killed  a man  in clear
superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.
   She Iorced  herselI throuJh  the last oI  the trooS and into  a  small oSen
sSace where two bearded Fremen were helSinJ Paul into his stillsuit.
   Jessica stared at her son. Paul’s eyes were briJht. He  breathed heavily,
SermittinJ the ministrations to his body rather than helSinJ them.
   “Him  aJainst Jamis and not a mark on him,” one oI the men muttered.
   Chani stood at one side, her eyes Iocused on Paul. Jessica saw the Jirl’s
e[citement, the admiration in the elIin Iace.
   It  must be done now and swiftly, Jessica thouJht.
   She comSressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: “Well-l-l,
now—how does it Ieel to be a killer?”
   Paul stiIIened  as thouJh he had been struck. He  met his mother’s  cold
Jlare and his Iace darkened with a rush oI blood. Involuntarily   he Jlanced
toward the Slace on the cavern Iloor where Jamis had lain.

343
   StilJar  Sressed throuJh to Jessica’s side, returninJ Irom the cave deSths
where the body  oI  Jamis had been  taken. He sSoke to  Paul in  a  bitter,
controlled tone: “When  the time comes Ior you  to call  me out and try  Ior
my burda, do  not think  you  will  Slay  with  me the way  you Slayed with
Jamis.”
   Jessica sensed the way her own words and StilJar’s sank into Paul, doinJ
their harsh work on  the boy. The mistake these SeoSle made—it served a
SurSose now. She searched the Iaces around them as Paul was doinJ, seeinJ
what he  saw. Admiration,  yes, and  Iear …  and  in  some—loathinJ. She
looked at StilJar, saw his Iatalism, knew how the IiJht had seemed to him.
   Paul looked at his mother. “You know what it was,” he said.
   She heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica sweSt her
Jlance across the trooS, said: “Paul has never beIore killed  a man with  a
naked blade.”
   StilJar  Iaced her, disbelieI in his Iace.
   “I  wasn’t SlayinJ with  him,” Paul said. He Sressed in Iront oI his mother,
straiJhteninJ his  robe, Jlanced at  the dark  Slace oI Jamis’  blood on  the
cavern Iloor. “I did not want to kill  him.”
   Jessica saw belieI  come slowly  to StilJar,  saw the  relieI  in him  as he
tuJJed  at  his  beard with   a  deeSly veined  hand.  She heard  mutterinJ
awareness sSread throuJh the trooS.
   “That’s  why  y’  asked him to  yield,”  StilJar  said. “I  see. Our ways  are
diIIerent,  but  you’ll   see the sense in  them.  I  thouJht  we’d  admitted  a
scorSion into our midst.”  He hesitated, then: “And I  shall not call  you lad
the more.”
   A  voice Irom the trooS called out: “Needs a naminJ, Stil.”
   StilJar  nodded, tuJJinJ  at his  beard. “I  see strenJth in you …  like  the
strenJth beneath a Sillar.”  AJain  he  Saused, then: “You shall  be known
amonJ us as Usul,  the base oI the  Sillar. This  is your  secret name, your
trooS name. We oI Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so Sresume
… Usul.”
   MurmurinJ   went  throuJh the  trooS: “Good  choice,  that  …  stronJ …
brinJ  us  luck.”   And  Jessica sensed the  acceStance, knowinJ  she was
included in it with her chamSion. She was indeed Sayyadina.
   “Now,  what name oI manhood do you choose Ior us to call you oSenly?”
StilJar asked.

344
   Paul  Jlanced  at his  mother,  back  to  StilJar.  Bits  and  Sieces oI  this
moment reJistered on his Srescient memory, but he Ielt the diIIerences as
thouJh they were Shysical, a Sressure IorcinJ him throuJh the narrow door
oI the Sresent.
   “How   do you call  amonJ you the little   mouse, the mouse that MumSs?”
Paul asked,  rememberinJ the  pop-hop  oI  motion   at  Tuono  Basin.  He
illustrated with one hand.
   A  chuckle sounded throuJh the trooS.
   “We call  that one muad’dib,” StilJar said.
   Jessica JasSed. It was the name Paul had told her, sayinJ that the Fremen
would acceSt them and call him thus. She Ielt a sudden Iear of her son and
for him.
   Paul  swallowed.  He  Ielt   that  he  Slayed a  Sart already  Slayed  over
countless times in his mind … yet …  there were diIIerences. He could see
himselI  Serched on  a  dizzyinJ  summit,  havinJ   e[Serienced much  and
Sossessed oI a SroIound store oI knowledJe, but all around him was abyss.
   And  aJain  he remembered the vision  oI  Ianatic  leJions IollowinJ   the
Jreen and black banner oI  the Atreides,  SillaJinJ  and burninJ across the
universe in the name oI their SroShet Muad’Dib.
   That must not happen, he told himselI.
   “Is  that the name you wish, Muad’Dib?” StilJar asked.
   “I  am an Atreides,” Paul whisSered, and then louder: “It’s not riJht that I
Jive uS entirely the name my Iather Jave me. Could I be known amonJ you
as Paul-Muad’Dib?”
   “You  are Paul-Muad’Dib,” StilJar said.
   And  Paul thouJht: That was in no vision of mine. I did a different thing.
   But he Ielt that the abyss remained all around him.
   AJain  a  murmurinJ resSonse went throuJh the trooS as man  turned to
man: “Wisdom with  strenJth …  Couldn’t  ask more …  It’s  the leJend Ior
sure … Lisan al-Gaib … Lisan al-Gaib….”
   “I  will   tell you a thinJ  about your new name,” StilJar  said. “The choice
Sleases us. Muad‘Dib is wise in the ways oI  the desert. Muad’Dib  creates
his own water. Muad‘Dib  hides Irom the sun and travels in the cool niJht.
Muad’Dib   is  IruitIul   and  multiSlies  over  the  land.  Muad‘Dib   we  call
’instructor-oI-boys.’  That is  a SowerIul base on which  to  build  your liIe,
Paul-Muad’Dib, who is Usul amonJ us. We welcome you.”

345
   StilJar   touched Paul’s  Iorehead  with  one  Salm,  withdrew  his   hand,
embraced Paul and murmured, “Usul.”
   As  StilJar  released him, another member oI  the  trooS embraced Paul,
reSeatinJ his new  trooS  name. And  Paul  was Sassed Irom  embrace to
embrace throuJh the trooS, hearinJ the voices, the shadinJs oI tone: “Usul
… Usul  …  Usul.”  Already, he  could Slace some oI  them by  name. And
there was Chani who Sressed her cheek aJainst his as she held him and said
his name.
   Presently Paul stood aJain beIore StilJar, who said: “Now, you are oI the
Ichwan  Bedwine,  our  brother.”  His  Iace  hardened, and he  sSoke with
command in his voice. “And now, Paul-Muad‘Dib, tiJhten uS that stillsuit.”
He Jlanced at Chani. “Chani! Paul-Muad’Dib’s  nose SluJs are as Soor a Iit
I’ve ever seen! I thouJht I ordered you to see aIter him!”
   “I  hadn’t the makinJs, Stil,” she said. “There’s Jamis’, oI course, but—”
   “EnouJh  oI that!”
   “Then  I’ll  share one oI mine,” she said. “I can make do with one until—”
   “You  will   not,” StilJar  said.“I  know  there are sSares amonJ us. Where
are the sSares? Are we a trooS toJether or a band oI savaJes?”
   Hands reached out Irom the trooS oIIerinJ  hard, Iibrous  obMects. StilJar
selected Iour, handed them to Chani. “Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina.”
   A  voice liIted Irom  the back oI the trooS: “What oI the water, Stil? What
oI the literMons in their Sack?”
   “I   know  your  need, Farok,”  StilJar   said. He  Jlanced at  Jessica. She
nodded.
   “Broach  one Ior those that need it,” StilJar said. “Watermaster … where
is a watermaster? Ah, Shimoom, care Ior the measurinJ oI what is needed.
The necessity  and no  more.  This   water is   the dower  SroSerty  oI  the
Sayyadina and will be reSaid in the sietch at Iield rates less Sack Iees.”
   “What  is the reSayment at Iield rates?” Jessica asked.
   “Ten Ior  one,” StilJar said.
   “But—”
   “It’s  a wise rule as you’ll come to see,” StilJar said.
   A  rustlinJ  oI  robes marked movement at the back oI  the trooS as men
turned to Jet the water.
   StilJar  held uS a hand, and there was silence. “As to Jamis,” he said, “I
order the  Iull   ceremony. Jamis was  our  comSanion and brother  oI  the
Ichwan Bedwine. There shall be  no turninJ  away without the  resSect due

346
one who Sroved our Iortune by his tahaddi-challenJe. I invoke the rite … at
sunset when the dark shall cover him.”
   Paul, hearinJ  these words, realized that he had SlunJed once more into
the abyss … blind time. There was no Sast occuSyinJ the Iuture in his mind
… e[ceSt  … e[ceSt  … he  could still  sense the Jreen and black Atreides
banner wavinJ … somewhere ahead … still see the Mihad’s bloody swords
and Ianatic leJions.
   It  will not be, he told himselI. Icannot let it be.

347
        God created Arrakis to train the faithful.
                                                  —from “The Wisdom of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  IN THE stillness  oI the  cavern, Jessica heard the  scraSe oI sand on rock  as
SeoSle moved, the distant  bird calls  that StilJar   had said were the siJnals  oI
his watchmen.
    The Jreat  Slastic hood-seals  had been removed  Irom  the cave’s  oSeninJ.
She could see the  march oI  eveninJ  shadows across the  liS oI  rock  in  Iront
oI  her and  the  oSen basin  beyond.  She sensed the  dayliJht   leavinJ   them,
sensed it  in  the  dry   heat  as well   as the  shadows.  She  knew  her  trained
awareness soon  would   Jive   her  what   these Fremen   obviously   had—the
ability  to sense even the sliJhtest  chanJe in the air’s  moisture.
    How   they  had  scurried   to  tiJhten    their  stillsuits    when  the  cave   was
oSened! DeeS within  the cave, someone beJan chantinJ:

        “Ima  trava okolo! 
        I korenMa okolo!” 

    Jessica translated silently:  These are ashes! And these are roots!”
    The Iuneral  ceremony Ior  Jamis was beJinninJ.
    She looked out  at the Arrakeen  sunset, at the banked decks oI  color  in the
sky. NiJht   was  beJinninJ  to  utter  its  shadows  alonJ  the distant  rocks  and
the dunes.
    Yet the heat Sersisted.
    Heat Iorced  her thouJhts  onto water  and the observed Iact  that this  whole
SeoSle could be trained to be thirsty  only  at Jiven  times.
    Thirst.
    She could   remember  moonlit   waves  on  Caladan  throwinJ   white   robes
over  rocks  …  and  the  wind   heavy  with   damSness. Now   the breeze  that
IinJered   her  robes   seared  the  Satches  oI   e[Sosed   skin   at  cheeks  and
Iorehead.  The  new  nose SluJs  irritated   her, and  she  Iound  herselI  overly
conscious  oI   the  tube   that  trailed   down   across  her   Iace  into   the  suit,
recoverinJ  her breath’s moisture.
    The suit itselI  was a sweatbo[.

348
   “Your  suit  will  be  more comfortable when  you’ve adjusted to  a lower
water content in your body, ” StillJar had said.
   She knew  he was riJht, but  the knowledJe made this moment no  more
comIortable. The unconscious SreoccuSation with water here weiJhed on
her mind. No, she corrected herselI: it was preoccupation with moisture.
   And  that was a more subtle and SroIound matter.
   She  heard aSSroachinJ IootsteSs, turned to see Paul come  out oI  the
cave’s deSths trailed by the elIin-Iaced Chani.
   There’s another  thing,  Jessica thouJht. Paul  must be  cautioned about
their women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As
concubine, yes, but not as wife.
   Then  she wondered at herselI, thinkinJ:  Have  I  been infected with his
schemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. I can think of
the marital  needs of royalty without  once weighing my own concubinage.
Yet … I was more than concubine.
   “Mother.”
   Paul stoSSed in Iront oI her. Chani stood at his elbow.
   “Mother,  do you know what they’re doinJ back there?”
   Jessica looked at the dark Satch oI his eyes starinJ out Irom the hood. “I
think so.”
   “Chani  showed me …  because I’m suSSosed to see it and Jive my  …
Sermission Ior the weiJhinJ oI the water.”
   Jessica looked at Chani.
   “They’re  recoverinJ  Jamis’ water,” Chani said, and her thin voice  came
out nasal Sast the nose SluJs. “It’s the rule. The Ilesh belonJs to the Serson,
but his water belonJs to the tribe … e[ceSt in the combat.”
   “They  say the water’s mine,” Paul said.
   Jessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.
   “Combat  water  belonJs to  the winner,”  Chani  said. “It’s   because you
have to IiJht in  the oSen without stillsuits. The winner has to Jet his water
back that he loses while IiJhtinJ.”
   “I   don’t  want his  water,” Paul muttered.  He Ielt  that he was  a Sart oI
many  imaJes  movinJ  simultaneously  in   a  IraJmentinJ  way   that  was
disconcertinJ to the inner eye. He could  not be certain what he would do,
but oI one thinJ he was Sositive: he did not want the water distilled  out oI
Jamis’ Ilesh.
   “It’s  … water,” Chani said.

349
   Jessica marveled at the way she said it. “Water.” So much meaninJ in a
simSle sound. A Bene Gesserit a[iom came to Jessica’s mind: “Survival is
the ability to  swim in strange water.”  And Jessica thouJht: Paul and I, we
must find the currents and patterns in  these strange waters … if  we’re to
survive.
   “You  will  acceSt the water,” Jessica said.
   She recoJnized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once
with Leto, tellinJ  her lost Duke that he would acceSt a larJe sum oIIered Ior
his suSSort in a Tuestionable venture—because money maintained Sower
Ior the Atreides.
   On Arrakis,  water was money. She saw that clearly.
   Paul remained silent, knowinJ then that he would do as she ordered—not
because she ordered it, but because her tone oI voice had Iorced him to re-
evaluate. To reIuse the  water  would  be to  break with   acceSted Fremen
Sractice.
   Presently Paul recalled the words  oI 467  Kalima in  Yueh’s O.C. Bible.
He said: “From water does all liIe beJin.”
   Jessica stared at  him.  Where did  he learn   that Tuotation?  she asked
herselI. He hasn’t sutdied the mysteries.
   “Thus  it is  sSoken,” Chani said. “Giudichar mantene: It is written  in the
Shah-Nama that water was the Iirst oI all thinJs created.”
   For  no reason she could  e[Slain (and  this bothered her  more than the
sensation), Jessica suddenly  shuddered. She  turned  away  to  hide  her
conIusion and was Must in time to see the sunset. A violent calamity oI color
sSilled over the sky as the sun diSSed beneath the horizon.
   “It  is time!”
   The voice  was StilJar’s rinJinJ  in  the cavern. “Jamis’ weaSon has been
killed. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud, who has ordained the
Shases Ior the moons that daily wane and—in the end—aSSear as bent and
withered twiJs.” StilJar’s  voice lowered. “Thus it is with Jamis.”
   Silence Iell like  a blanket on the cavern.
   Jessica saw the  Jray-shadow movement oI  StilJar  like  a  Jhost IiJure
within  the dark inner  reaches. She Jlanced back at the basin, sensinJ the
coolness.
   “The  Iriends oI Jamis will aSSroach,” StilJar said.
   Men  moved  behind Jessica, droSSinJ a curtain across the  oSeninJ. A
sinJle JlowJlobe was liJhted overhead Iar back in the cave. Its yellow Jlow

350
Sicked out an inIlowinJ  oI human IiJures. Jessica heard the rustlinJ oI the
robes.
   Chani took a steS away as thouJh Sulled by the liJht.
   Jessica bent close to  Paul’s ear, sSeakinJ in  the Iamily  code:  “Follow
their lead; do as they do. It will  be a simSle ceremony to Slacate the shade
oI Jamis.”
   It  will  be more than that, Paul thouJht. And he Ielt a wrenchinJ sensation
within  his  awareness as thouJh he  were tryinJ   to  JrasS some thinJ  in
motion and render it motionless.
   Chani  Jlided back  to Jessica’s side, took her hand. “Come,  Sayyadina.
We must sit aSart.”
   Paul watched them move oII into the shadows, leavinJ him alone. He Ielt
abandoned.
   The men who had Ii[ed the curtain came uS beside him.
   “Come, Usul.”
   He  allowed himselI  to be Juided Iorward,  to be Sushed into a circle  oI
SeoSle beinJ Iormed around StilJar, who stood beneath the JlowJlobe and
beside a bundled, curvinJ, and anJular shaSe Jathered beneath a robe on the
rock Iloor.
   The  trooS crouched down at a Jesture Irom  StilJar,  their robes hissinJ
with  the movement. Paul settled  with  them, watchinJ  StilJar, notinJ  the
way the overhead Jlobe made Sits oI his eyes and briJhtened the touch oI
Jreen Iabric  at  his  neck. Paul  shiIted  his attention  to  the  robe-covered
mound at StilJar’s Ieet, recoJnized the handle oI a baliset SrotrudinJ Irom
the Iabric.
   “The  sSirit  leaves the body’s water when  the Iirst  moon rises,”  StilJar
intoned. “Thus  it  is sSoken. When we  see the Iirst  moon rise this  niJht,
whom will it  summon?”
   “Jamis,”  the trooS resSonded.
   StilJar  turned Iull  circle on one heel, SassinJ his Jaze across the rinJ oI
Iaces. “I  was a Iriend oI  Jamis,” he  said. “When the  hawk Slane stooSed
uSon us at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis Sulled me to saIety.”
   He bent over the Sile beside him, liIted away the robe. “I take this robe as
a Iriend  oI  Jamis—leader’s riJht.”   He draSed the  robe over  a shoulder,
straiJhteninJ.
   Now,  Paul saw the contents oI  the mound e[Sosed: the Sale JlisteninJ
Jray oI  a stillsuit,  a battered literMon, a kerchieI with  a small  book in  its

351
center, the bladeless handle oI a cryskniIe, an emSty sheath, a Iolded Sack, a
SaracomSass, a distrans, a thumSer, a Sile oI Iist-sized metallic hooks, an
assortment oI what looked like small rocks within  a Iold  oI cloth, a clumS
oI bundled Ieathers … and the baliset e[Sosed beside the Iolded Sack.
   So Jamis played the baliset, Paul thouJht. The instrument reminded him
oI Gurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul knew with his memory oI  the
Iuture in  the  Sast that some chance-lines could  Sroduce a meetinJ with
Halleck, but the reunions were Iew and shadowed. They Suzzled him. The
uncertainty Iactor touched him with wonder. Does it mean that something I
will do … that  I may do, could destroy Gurney … or bring him back to life
… or….
   Paul swallowed, shook his head.
   AJain,  StilJar bent over the mound.
   “For  Jamis’ woman and Ior the Juards,” he said. The small rocks and the
book were taken into the Iolds oI his robe.
   “Leader’s riJht,”  the trooS intoned.
   “The  marker Ior  Jamis’ coIIee service,” StilJar  said, and he liIted a Ilat
disc oI Jreen  metal. “That  it shall  be Jiven  to Usul  in suitable ceremony
when we return to the sietch.”
   “Leader’s riJht,”  the trooS intoned.
   Lastly,  he took the cryskniIe  handle and stood with  it. “For  the Iuneral
Slain,” he said.
   “For  the Iuneral Slain,” the trooS resSonded.
   At  her Slace in the circle  across Irom Paul, Jessica nodded, recoJnizinJ
the ancient  source oI   the  rite,  and  she thouJht:  The  meeting between
ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture—it  begins in  the
dignity  with   which   we  treat   our   dead.  She  looked  across  at  Paul,
wondering: Will he see it? Will he know what to do?’
   “We  are Iriends oI Jamis,” StilJar said. “We are not wailinJ  Ior our dead
like a Sack oI JarvarJ.”
   A  Jray-bearded man to Paul’s leIt stood uS. “I was a Iriend oI Jamis,” he
said. He crossed to the mound, liIted  the distrans. “When  our water went
below minim at the sieJe at Two Brids, Jamis shared.” The man returned to
his Slace in the circle.
   Am I  supposed to say I was a friend of  Jamis? Paul wondered. Do they
expect me to take something from that pile? He saw Iaces turn toward him,
turn away. They do expect it!

352
   Another  man across Irom Paul arose, went to the Sack and removed the
SaracomSass. “I was a Iriend oI Jamis,” he said. “When the Satrol cauJht us
at BiJht-oI-the-CliII    and  I  was  wounded, Jamis  drew  them oII   so  the
wounded could be saved.” He returned to his Slace in the circle.
   AJain,  the Iaces turned toward Paul, and he saw the e[Sectancy in them,
lowered his eyes. An  elbow nudJed him  and a voice hissed: “Would  you
brinJ the destruction on us?”
   How can I say I was his friend? Paul wondered.
   Another  IiJure  arose Irom  the circle  oSSosite Paul and, as the hooded
Iace came into the liJht, he recoJnized his mother. She removed a kerchieI
Irom the  mount. “I  was a Iriend  oI  Jamis,” she said. “When  the sSirit  oI
sSirits within him saw the needs oI truth, that sSirit withdrew and sSared my
son.” She returned to her Slace.
   And  Paul recalled the scorn in his mother’s voice as she had conIronted
him aIter the IiJht. “How  does it feel to be a killer?”
   AJain,  he saw the Iaces turned toward him, Ielt the anJer and Iear in the
trooS. A SassaJe his mother had once Iilmbooked Ior him on “The Cult oI
the Dead” Ilickered throuJh Paul’s mind. He knew what he had to do.
   Slowly,  Paul Jot to his Ieet.
   A  siJh Sassed around the circle.
   Paul Ielt  the diminishment  oI his self  as he advanced into the center oI
the circle. It was as thouJh he lost a IraJment oI himselI and souJht it here.
He bent  over  the mound  oI  belonJinJs,  liIted  out  the  baliset. A  strinJ
twanJed soItly as it struck aJainst somethinJ in the Sile.
   “I  was a Iriend oI Jamis,” Paul whisSered.
   He Ielt  tears burninJ his eyes, Iorced more volume into his voice. “Jamis
tauJht me …  that …  when you  kill  …  you Say Ior  it.  I  wish I’d  known
Jamis better.”
   Blindly,  he JroSed his way back to his Slace in the circle, sank to the rock
Iloor.
   A  voice hissed: “He sheds tears!”
   It  was taken uS around the rinJ: “Usul Jives moisture to the dead!”
   He Ielt  IinJers touch his damS cheek, heard the awed whisSers.
   Jessica, hearinJ the voices, Ielt the deSth oI the e[Serience, realized what
terrible inhibitions there must be aJainst sheddinJ tears. She Iocused on the
words: “He gives moisture to the dead. ” It  was a JiIt to the shadow world
—tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.

353
   NothinJ  on this Slanet had so IorceIully hammered into her the ultimate
value oI water. Not the water-sellers, not the dried skins oI the natives, not
stillsuits or the rules oI  water disciSline. Here there was a substance more
Srecious than all  others—it was  liIe  itselI  and entwined  all around  with
symbolism and ritual.
   Water.
   “I  touched his cheek,” someone whisSered. “I Ielt the JiIt.”
   At  Iirst,  the  IinJers touchinJ  his Iace IriJhtened  Paul. He  clutched the
cold handle oI the baliset, IeelinJ the strinJs bite his Salm. Then he saw the
Iaces beyond the JroSinJ hands—the eyes wide and wonderinJ.
   Presently, the hands withdrew. The Iuneral ceremony resumed. But now
there was a subtle sSace around Paul, a drawinJ back as the trooS honored
him by a resSectIul isolation.
   The ceremony ended with a low chant:

       “Full  moon calls thee—
       Shai-hulud shalt thou see;  
       Red the niJht, dusky sky,  
       Bloody  death didst thou die.  
       We Sray to a moon: she is round— 
       Luck with  us will then abound,      
       What we seek Ior shall be Iound  
       In the land oI solid Jround.” 






   A  bulJinJ  sack remained at StilJar’s Ieet. He crouched, Slaced his Salms
aJainst it. Someone came uS beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul
recoJnized Chani’s Iace in the hood shadow.
   “Jamis   carried  thirty-three  liters   and  seven and  three-thirty-seconds
drachms oI the tribe’s water,” Chani said. “I bless it now in the Sresence oI
a Sayyadina. Ekkeri-akairi, this is the water, Iillissin-Iollasy  oI Paul-Muad’
Dib!  Kivi  a-kavi,  never the more,  nakalas! Nakelas! to  be measured and
counted, ukair-an! by the heartbeats Man-Man-Man oI our Iriend … Jamis.”
   In  an abruSt and SroIound silence, Chani turned, stared at Paul. Presently
she said: “Where I am Ilame be thou the coals. Where I am dew be thou the

354
water.”
   “Bi-lal   kaiIa,” intoned the trooS.
   “To  Paul-Muad’Dib  Joes this Sortion,” Chani said. “May  he Juard it Ior
the tribe, SreservinJ it aJainst careless loss. May he be Jenerous with it in
time oI need. May he Sass it on in his time Ior the Jood oI the tribe.”
   “Bi-lal   kaiIa,” intoned the trooS.
   I  must accept that water, Paul thouJht. Slowly, he arose, made his way to
Chani’s side. StilJar steSSed back to make room Ior him,  took the baliset
Jently Irom his hand.
   “Kneel,”  Chani said.
   Paul knelt.
   She Juided  his  hands to the  waterbaJ, held them  aJainst the  resilient
surIace. “With this  water the tribe entrusts thee,” she said. “Jamis is Jone
Irom it. Take it in Seace.” She stood, SullinJ Paul uS with her.
   StilJar  returned the baliset, e[tended a  small Sile oI  metal rinJs  in one
Salm. Paul looked at them, seeinJ the diIIerent sizes, the way the liJht  oI
the JlowJlobe reIlected oII them.
   Chani took  the larJest rinJ,  held it on  a IinJer. “Thirty   liters,”  she said.
One by  one, she took  the others, showinJ  each to  Paul, countinJ  them.
“Two  liters;   one  liter;  seven  watercounters oI   one  drachm  each; one
watercounter oI three-thirty-seconds drachms. In all—thirty-three liters and
seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.”
   She held them uS on her IinJer Ior Paul to see.
   “Do  you acceSt them?” StilJar asked.
   Paul swallowed, nodded. “Yes.”
   “Later,”   Chani said, “I  will  show  you how  to tie them  in a kerchieI  so
they won’t rattle and Jive you away when you need silence.” She e[tended
her hand.
   “Will   you … hold them Ior me?” Paul asked.
   Chani turned a startled Jlance on StilJar.
   He  smiled, said,  “Paul-Muad’Dib  who  is  Usul does not  yet know  our
ways, Chani. Hold his watercounters without commitment until it’s  time to
show him the manner oI carryinJ them.”
   She nodded, whiSSed a ribbon oI cloth Irom beneath her robe, linked the
rinJs  onto it   with  an  intricate over  and  under weavinJ,  hesitated, then
stuIIed them into the sash beneath her robe.

355
   I  missed something there, Paul thouJht. He sensed the IeelinJ oI humor
around him, somethinJ banterinJ in  it, and his mind  linked uS a Srescient
memory: watercounters offered to a woman—courtship ritual.
   “Watermasters,” StilJar said.
   The  trooS arose in a hissinJ  oI robes. Two  men steSSed out, liIted the
waterbaJ. StilJar took  down  the JlowJlobe,  led  the way  with  it  into the
deSths oI the cave.
   Paul was Sressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery Jlow  oI  liJht  over
rock walls, the way the shadows danced, and he Ielt the trooS’s liIt oI sSirits
contained in a hushed air oI e[Sectancy.
   Jessica, Sulled into the end oI the trooS by eaJer hands, hemmed around
by MostlinJ bodies, suSSressed a moment oI  Sanic. She had  recoJnized
IraJments oI the ritual, identiIied the shards oI Chakobsa and Bhotani-Mib in
the words, and she knew the wild violence that could e[Slode  out oI these
seeminJly simSle moments.
   Jan-jan-jan, she thouJht. Go-go-go.
   It  was like a child’s Jame that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.
   StilJar  stoSSed at a yellow rock wall. He Sressed an outcroSSinJ and the
wall swunJ  silently away Irom  him,  oSeninJ alonJ an irreJular crack.  He
led the way  throuJh  Sast a dark honey-comb lattice  that  directed a cool
wash oI air across Paul when he Sassed it.
   Paul turned a TuestioninJ stare on Chani, tuJJed her arm. “That  air Ielt
damS,” he said.
   “Sh-h-h-h,”  she whisSered.
   But  a  man behind them  said: “Plenty  oI  moisture  in the  traS toniJht.
Jamis’ way oI tellinJ us he’s satisIied.”
   Jessica Sassed throuJh the secret door, heard it close behind.  She saw
how  the Fremen  slowed  while  SassinJ the  honeycomb lattice,  Ielt   the
damSness oI the air as she came oSSosite it.
   Windtrap!  she thouJht. They’ve a concealed windtrap somewhere on the
surface to  funnel air   down here into  cooler  regions  and precipitate  the
moisture from it.
   They Sassed throuJh another rock door with latticework above it, and the
door closed behind them. The draIt oI air at their backs carried a sensation
oI moisture clearly SerceStible to both Jessica and Paul.
   At  the head oI the trooS, the JlowJlobe in StilJar’s hands droSSed below
the level oI  the heads in Iront  oI Paul. Presently he Ielt  steSs beneath his

356
Ieet, curvinJ down to the leIt.  LiJht  reIlected back uS across hooded heads
and a windinJ movement oI SeoSle sSiralinJ down the steSs.
   Jessica sensed mountinJ tension in the SeoSle around her, a Sressure oI
silence that rasSed her nerves with its urJency.
   The steSs ended and the trooS Sassed throuJh another low door. The liJht
oI the JlowJlobe  was swallowed in a Jreat oSen sSace with a hiJh curved
ceilinJ.
   Paul  Ielt Chani’s  hand on his  arm, heard a Iaint  driSSinJ sound in  the
chill  air,  Ielt  an  utter  stillness  come over  the  Fremen in  the  cathedral
Sresence oI water.
   I  have seen this place in a dream, he thouJht.
   The  thouJht was both  reassurinJ and IrustratinJ.  Somewhere ahead oI
him on this Sath, the Ianatic hordes cut their Jory Sath across the universe
in his name. The Jreen and black Atreides banner would become a symbol
oI terror.  Wild  leJions would  charJe into  battle screaminJ their  war cry:
“Muad’Dib!”
   It  must not be, he thought. I cannot let it happen.
   But  he could Ieel the demandinJ race consciousness within him, his own
terrible  SurSose, and  he  knew  that  no  small   thinJ  could   deIlect  the
MuJJernaut. It was JatherinJ weiJht and momentum. II he died this instant,
the thinJ would  Jo  on throuJh  his mother and his  unborn sister. NothinJ
less than the deaths oI all the trooS Jathered here and now—himselI and his
mother included—could stoS the thinJ.
   Paul stared around him, saw the trooS sSread out in a line. They Sressed
him Iorward  aJainst  a low  barrier  carved Irom  native  rock. Beyond  the
barrier in the Jlow oI StilJar’s  Jlobe, Paul saw an unruIIled dark surIace oI
water. It stretched away into shadows—deeS and black—the Iar wall only
Iaintly visible, SerhaSs a hundred meters away.
   Jessica Ielt the dry SullinJ oI skin on her cheeks and Iorehead rela[inJ in
the Sresence oI moisture. The  water Sool was  deeS; she could sense its
deeSness, and resisted a desire to diS her hands into it.
   A  sSlashinJ sounded on her leIt. She looked down the shadowy line  oI
Fremen, saw StilJar with  Paul  standinJ beside him and the  watermasters
emStyinJ their  load into  the Sool throuJh  a Ilowmeter.  The meter was a
round Jray eye above the Sool’s rim. She saw its JlowinJ Sointer move as
the water Ilowed throuJh it, saw the Sointer stoS at thirty-three liters, seven
and three-thirty-seconds drachms.

357
   Superb accuracy in  water measurement, Jessica thouJht. And she noted
that the walls oI the meter trouJh held no trace oI moisture aIter the water’s
SassaJe. The water Ilowed oII those walls without bindinJ tension. She saw
a SroIound  clue  to  Fremen  technoloJy  in   the  simSle Iact:   they  were
SerIectionists.
   Jessica worked her way down the barrier to StilJar’s side. Way was made
Ior her with  casual courtesy. She noted the withdrawn look in Paul’s eyes,
but the mystery oI this Jreat Sool oI water dominated her thouJhts.
   StilJar  looked at her. “There were those amonJ us in need oI water,” he
said, “yet  they would  come here and not touch  this water. Do  you know
that?”
   “I  believe it,”  she said.
   He looked at the Sool. “We have more than thirty-eiJht million decaliters
here,” he said. “Walled oII Irom the little makers, hidden and Sreserved.”
   “A  treasure trove,” she said.
   StilJar  liIted  the Jlobe to look  into her eyes. “It  is Jreater than treasure.
We have thousands oI such caches. Only a Iew oI us know  them all.”  He
cocked his head to one side. The Jlobe cast a yellow-shadowed Jlow across
Iace and beard. “Hear that?”
   They listened.
   The driSSinJ oI water SreciSitated Irom the windtraS Iilled the room with
its Sresence. Jessica saw that the entire trooS was cauJht uS in a raSture oI
listeninJ. Only Paul seemed to stand remote Irom it.
   To  Paul, the sound was like moments tickinJ  away. He could  Ieel time
IlowinJ  throuJh him, the instants never to be recaStured. He sensed a need
Ior decision, but Ielt Sowerless to move.
   “It  has been calculated with Srecision,” StilJar  whisSered. “We know to
within a million   decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall
chanJe the Iace oI Arrakis.”
   A  hushed whisSer oI resSonse liIted Irom the trooS: “Bi-lal kaiIa.”
   “We  will  traS the dunes beneath Jrass SlantinJs,” StilJar said, his voice
JrowinJ  stronJer.  “We  will   tie  the  water  into  the  soil   with  trees and
underJrowth.”
   “Bi-lal   kaiIa,” intoned the trooS.
   “Each year the Solar ice retreats,” StilJar said.
   “Bi-lal   kaiIa,” they chanted.

358
   “We  shall  make a  homeworld  oI  Arrakis—with  meltinJ   lenses at the
Soles, with lakes in the  temSerate zones, and only the deeS desert Ior the
maker and his sSice.”
   “Bi-lal   kaiIa.”
   “And  no man ever aJain shall want Ior  water. It shall be his Ior  diSSinJ
Irom well  or Sond or lake or canal. It shall run down throuJh the Tanats to
Ieed our Slants. It  shall be  there Ior  any man to  take. It  shall be his  Ior
holdinJ out his hand.”
   “Bi-lal   kaiIa.”
   Jessica Ielt the reliJious  ritual in  the words, noted her own instinctively
awed resSonse. They’re in league with the future, she thouJht. They have
their mountain to  climb.  This is the scientist’s dream … and  these simple
people, these peasants, are filled with it.
   Her thouJhts turned to Liet-Kynes, the EmSeror’s Slanetary ecoloJist, the
man who had Jone native—and she wondered at him. This was a dream to
caSture men’s souls, and she could sense the hand oI the ecoloJist in it. This
was a dream  Ior  which  men would  die  willinJly.   It  was another oI  the
essential inJredients that she Ielt her son needed: SeoSle with a Joal. Such
SeoSle would be easy to imbue with Iervor and Ianaticism. They could  be
wielded like a sword to win back Paul’s Slace Ior him.
   “We  leave now,” StilJar said, “and wait Ior the Iirst  moon’s risinJ. When
Jamis is saIely on his way, we will Jo home.”
   WhisSerinJ  their reluctance, the  trooS Iell  in  behind him,  turned back
alonJ the water barrier and uS the stairs.
   And  Paul,  walkinJ  behind Chani,  Ielt  that a vital   moment had Sassed
him, that he had missed an essential decision and was now cauJht uS in his
own myth.  He  knew  he had seen this  Slace beIore, e[Serienced it   in  a
IraJment oI  Srescient dream on Iaraway Caladan, but details oI the Slace
were beinJ  Iilled  in  now  that  he had not  seen. He  Ielt  a new  sense oI
wonder at the limits oI his JiIt.  It was as thouJh he rode within the wave oI
time, sometimes in its trouJh, sometimes on a crest—and all around him the
other waves liIted  and Iell,  revealinJ  and then hidinJ  what  they bore on
their surIace.
   ThrouJh  it all, the wild  Mihad still loomed ahead oI him, the violence and
the slauJhter. It was like a Sromontory above the surI.
   The trooS Iiled  throuJh the last door into the main cavern. The door was
sealed. LiJhts were e[tinJuished, hoods removed Irom the cavern oSeninJs,

359
revealinJ the niJht and the stars that had come over the desert.
   Jessica moved to the dry liS oI the cavern’s edJe, looked uS at the stars.
They were sharS and near. She Ielt  the  stirrinJ  oI  the trooS around her,
heard the sound oI a baliset beinJ tuned somewhere behind her, and Paul’s
voice humminJ the Sitch. There was a melancholy in his tone that she did
not like.
   Chani’s voice  intruded Irom the deeS cave darkness: “Tell me about the
waters oI your birthworld, Paul Muad’Dib.”
   And  Paul: “Another time, Chani. I Sromise.”
   Such sadness.
   “It’s  a Jood baliset,” Chani said.
   “Very  Jood,” Paul said. “Do you think Jamis’ll mind my  usinJ it?”
   He   speaks of  the  dead  in   the  present  tense, Jessica thouJht.   The
imSlications disturbed her.
   A  man’s voice intruded: “He liked music betimes, Jamis did.”
   “Then  sinJ me one oI your sonJs,” Chani Sleaded.
   Such feminine  allure  in  that girl-child’s   voice, Jessica thouJht. I  must
caution Paul about their women … and soon.
   “This  was a sonJ oI a Iriend oI mine,” Paul said. “I e[Sect he’s dead now,
Gurney is. He called it his evensonJ.”
   The trooS Jrew still,  listeninJ  as Paul’s voice liIted in a sweet boy tenor
with the baliset tinklinJ and strumminJ beneath it:

       “This  clear time oI seeinJ embers—
       A  Jold-briJht sun’s lost in Iirst dusk.  
       What Irenzied senses, desS‘rate musk 
       Are consort oI rememb’rinJ.” 

   Jessica Ielt  the  verbal  music  in  her breast—SaJan and charJed  with
sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware oI herselI, IeelinJ her
own body and its needs. She listened with a tense stillness.

       “NiJht’s  Searl-censered reTui-em … 
       ’Tis  Ior us!                                         
       What Moys run, then— 
       BriJht  in your eyes— 
       What Ilower-sSanJled  amores 
                                                        

360
       Pull at our hearts … 
       What Ilower-sSanJled  amores 
       Fill  our desires.” 

   And  Jessica heard the aIter-stillness that hummed in the air with the last
note. Why does  my son  sing a  love  song to  that  girl-child?   she  asked
herselI. She Ielt an abruSt Iear. She could sense liIe IlowinJ around her and
she had no JrasS on its reins. Why did he choose that song? she wondered.
The instincts are true sometimes. Why did he do this?
   Paul  sat silently in  the darkness, a sinJle  stark thouJht dominatinJ  his
awareness: My mother is my enemy. She does not know it, but she is. She is
bringing the jihad. She bore me; she trained me. She is my enemy.

361
        The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the
        future.
                                            —from “Collected SayinJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  ON HIS   seventeenth  birthday,   Feyd-Rautha   Harkonnen    killed   his   one
hundredth slave-Jladiator   in  the  Iamily  James.  VisitinJ   observers Irom   the
ImSerial   Court—a   Count   and   Lady   FenrinJ—were    on   the  Harkonnen
homeworld  oI  Giedi  Prime  Ior  the  event, invited   to  sit that  aIternoon  with
the immediate  Iamily  in the  Jolden bo[   above the trianJular  arena.
    In  honor  oI  the  na-Baron’s  nativity    and to  remind   all  Harkonnens  and
subMects that Feyd-Rautha   was  heir-desiJnate,   it   was   holiday   on  Giedi
Prime. The  old Baron  had decreed  a meridian-to-meridian   rest  Irom  labors,
and eIIort  had been sSent in the Iamily  city  oI Harko  to create the illusion   oI
Jaiety:  banners  Ilew  Irom   buildinJs,   new  Saint had  been  sSlashed on the
walls alonJ  Court  Way.
    But  oII   the  main  way,  Count   FenrinJ   and  his  lady  noted  the  rubbish
heaSs, the scabrous brown walls  reIlected  in  the dark Suddles oI  the streets,
and the Iurtive  scurryinJ  oI  the SeoSle.
    In  the  Baron’s  blue-walled    keeS, there  was  IearIul   SerIection,  but   the
Count  and  his   lady   saw  the  Srice  beinJ   Said—Juards   everywhere   and
weaSons with  that sSecial sheen that told  a trained  eye they  were in  reJular
use. There  were  checkSoints   Ior  routine   SassaJe Irom  area  to  area even
within   the keeS.  The  servants  revealed  their  military   traininJ   in   the way
they walked,  in  the set  oI their  shoulders  …  in  the way  their  eyes watched
and watched and watched.
    “The   Sressure’s  on,”   the  Count   hummed   to  his   lady   in  their   secret
lanJuaJe. “The  Baron  is Must beJinninJ to  see the Srice he really  Said to  rid
himselI  oI the Duke  Leto.”
    “Sometime  I must  recount Ior  you the leJend  oI the Shoeni[,”   she said.
    They  were in  the  receStion  hall  oI  the keeS waitinJ   to  Jo  to the  Iamily
James. It  was  not a  larJe hall—SerhaSs  Iorty   meters lonJ  and  halI  that  in
width—but   Ialse  Sillars   alonJ  the  sides  had been  shaSed with   an  abruSt
taSer, and  the  ceilinJ   had  a subtle   arch,  all  JivinJ    the  illusion   oI  much
Jreater sSace.

362
   “Ah-h-h,  here comes the Baron,” the Count said.
   The   Baron  moved  down  the  lenJth   oI  the  hall   with   that  Seculiar
waddlinJ-Jlide   imSarted by   the  necessities oI  JuidinJ   susSensor-hunJ
weiJht. His Mowls bobbed uS and down; the susSensors MiJJled and shiIted
beneath his oranJe robe. RinJs Jlittered  on his  hands and oSaIires shone
where they had been woven into the robe.
   At  the Baron’s elbow walked Feyd-Rautha. His dark hair was dressed in
close rinJlets that seemed inconJruously Jay above sullen eyes. He wore a
tiJht-IittinJ   black tunic and snuJ  trousers with a suJJestion oI  bell at  the
bottom. SoIt-soled sliSSers covered his small Ieet.
   Lady FenrinJ, notinJ  the younJ man’s Soise and the sure Ilow oI muscles
beneath the tunic thouJht: Here’s one who won’t let himself go to fat.
   The  Baron  stoSSed in  Iront   oI  them,  took  Feyd-Rautha’s arm  in   a
Sossessive JriS,    said,    “My     neShew,  the    na-Baron,   Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen.” And,  turninJ his  baby-Iat Iace toward Feyd-Rautha, he said,
“The Count and Lady FenrinJ oI whom I’ve sSoken.”
   Feyd-Rautha diSSed his head with the reTuired courtesy. He stared at the
Lady FenrinJ. She was Jolden-haired and willowy, her SerIection oI IiJure
clothed  in  a  IlowinJ    Jown   oI  ecru—simSle  Iitness  oI   Iorm   without
ornament. Gray-Jreen eyes stared back at him. She had that Bene Gesserit
serene reSose about her that the younJ man Iound subtly disturbinJ.
   “Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m-m,”   said the  Count. He studied Feyd-Rautha.
“The, hm-m-m-m, precise younJ man, ah, my … hm-m-m-m … dear?” The
Count Jlanced at the Baron. “My dear Baron, you say you’ve sSoken oI us
to this Srecise younJ man? What did you say?”
   “I  told my  neShew oI the Jreat esteem our EmSeror holds Ior you, Count
FenrinJ,” the  Baron said, And he  thouJht: Mark  him well,  Feyd!  A killer
with the manners of a rabbit—this is the most dangerous kind.
   “OI  course!” said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.
   Feyd-Rautha Iound the man’s actions and words almost insultinJ.  They
stoSSed Must short oI somethinJ overt that would reTuire notice. The younJ
man Iocused his attention on the  Count: a small man,  weak-lookinJ. The
Iace was weaselish with overlarJe dark eyes. There was Jray at the temSles.
And his movements—he moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he
sSoke another way. It was diIIicult to Iollow.
   “Um-m-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m,     you   come   uSon  such,   mm-m-m,
Sreciseness so rarely,” the Count said, addressinJ the Baron’s shoulder. “I

363
… ah, conJratulate you on the  hm-m-m SerIection oI your  ah-h-h heir. In
the liJht oI the hm-m-m elder, one miJht say.”
   “You  are too  kind,”  the Baron said. He  bowed, but Feyd-Rautha noted
that his uncle’s eyes did not aJree with the courtesy.
   “When  you’re  mm-m-m ironic,  that ah-h-h  suJJests you’re hm-m-m-m
thinkinJ deeS thouJhts,” the Count said.
   There  he goes again,  Feyd-Rautha thouJht.  It  sounds like  he’s being
insulting, but there’s nothing you can call out for satisfaction.
   ListeninJ  to  the man Jave Feyd-Rautha the IeelinJ  his head was beinJ
Sushed throuJh mush … um-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m-m! Feyd-Rautha turned
his attention back to the Lady FenrinJ.
   “We’re  ah-h-h takinJ uS too much oI this younJ man’s time,” she said. “I
understand he’s to aSSear in the arena today.”
   By  the houris of  the Imperial  hareem, she’s a lovely one!  Feyd-Rautha
thouJht. He said:  “I  shall make  a kill  Ior  you  this day, my  Lady. I  shall
make the dedication in the arena, with your Sermission.”
   She returned  his stare serenely, but her  voice  carried whiSlash as she
said: “You do not have my Sermission.”
   “Feyd!”   the Baron said.  And he thouJht:  That imp!  Does he want  this
deadly Count to call him out?
   But the Count only smiled and said: “Hm-m-m-m-um-m-m.”
   “You  really  must be JettinJ ready Ior  the arena, Feyd,” the Baron said.
“You must be rested and not take any Ioolish risks.”
   Feyd-Rautha bowed, his Iace dark with resentment. “I’m sure everythinJ
will  be as you  wish, Uncle.”  He  nodded to Count  FenrinJ. “Sir.”   To the
lady: “My  Lady.”  And he turned, strode out oI  the hall, barely JlancinJ  at
the knot oI Families Minor near the double doors.
   “He’s  so younJ,” the Baron siJhed.
   “Um-m-m-m-ah  indeed hmmm,” the Count said.
   And  the Lady FenrinJ thouJht: Can that be the young man the Reverend
Mother meant? Is that a bloodline we must preserve?
   “We’ve  more  than an hour beIore JoinJ  to  the arena,” the Baron  said.
“PerhaSs we could have our little talk now, Count  FenrinJ.” He tiSSed his
Jross head to the riJht.  “There’s a considerable amount oI  SroJress to be
discussed.”
   And  the Baron thouJht:  Let us see now how  the Emperor’s errand boy
gets across whatever message he carries without ever being so crass as to

364
speak it right out.
   The Count  sSoke to his lady: “Um-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m,  you mm-m
will ah-h-h e[cuse us, my dear?”
   “Each  day, some time each hour, brinJs chanJe,”  she said. “Mm-m-m-
m.”  And she smiled  sweetly at the  Baron beIore turninJ  away. Her  lonJ
skirts swished and she walked with a straiJht-backed reJal stride toward the
double doors at the end oI the hall.
   The  Baron noted how  all  conversation amonJ the Houses Minor  there
stoSSed at her aSSroach, how the eyes Iollowed  her. Bene Gesserit! the
Baron thouJht. The universe would be better rid of them all!
   “There’s  a cone oI  silence between two oI  the Sillars over here on  our
leIt,”  the Baron said. “We can talk there without  Iear oI beinJ overheard.”
He led  the  way  with  his  waddlinJ  Jait  into  the  sound-deadeninJ Iield,
IeelinJ the noises oI the keeS become dull and distant.
   The Count moved uS beside the Baron, and they turned, IacinJ the wall
so their liSs could not be read.
   “We’re   not   satisIied  with   the  way  you   ordered  the  Sardaukar oII
Arrakis,” the Count said.
   Straight talk!  the Baron thouJht.
   “The  Sardaukar could not stay lonJer without  riskinJ  that others would
Iind out how the EmSeror helSed me,” the Baron said.
   “But   your  neShew Rabban  does not  aSSear to  be SressinJ  stronJly
enouJh toward a solution oI the Fremen Sroblem.”
   “What  does the EmSeror wish?” the Baron asked. “There cannot be more
than  a  handIul   oI   Fremen  leIt   on   Arrakis.   The  southern  desert  is
uninhabitable. The northern desert is sweSt reJularly by our Satrols.”
   “Who  says the southern desert is uninhabitable?”
   “Your  own SlanetoloJist said it, my dear Count.”
   “But  Doctor Kynes is dead.”
   “Ah,  yes … unIortunate, that.”
   “We’ve  word Irom  an overIliJht  across the southern reaches,” the Count
said. “There’s evidence oI Slant liIe.”
   “Has the Guild then aJreed to a watch Irom sSace?”
   “You  know  better than that, Baron.  The EmSeror cannot leJally  Sost a
watch on Arrakis.”
   “And  I cannot aIIord it,”  the Baron said. “Who made this overIliJht?”
   “A  … smuJJler.”

365
   “Someone has lied  to you,  Count,”  the Baron said. “SmuJJlers  cannot
naviJate the southern reaches any better than can Rabban’s men. Storms,
sand-static, and all that,  you know.  NaviJation  markers are knocked  out
Iaster than they can be installed.”
   “We’ll  discuss various tySes oI static another time,” the Count said.
   Ah-h-h-h,  the  Baron  thouJht. “Have   you  Iound some  mistake in  my
accountinJ then?” he demanded.
   “When  you  imaJine mistakes there can be no  selI-deIense,” the Count
said.
   He’s deliberately trying  to arouse my anger, the Baron thouJht. He took
two deeS breaths to calm himselI. He could  smell his own  sweat, and the
harness oI the susSensors beneath his robe Ielt suddenly itchy and JallinJ.
   “The  EmSeror cannot be unhaSSy about the death oI the concubine and
the boy,” the Baron said. “They Iled into the desert. There was a storm.”
   “Yes, there were so many convenient accidents,” the Count aJreed.
   “I  do not like your tone, Count,” the Baron said.
   “AnJer  is  one thinJ, violence another,” the Count said. “Let  me caution
you: Should an unIortunate accident occur to me here the Great Houses all
would learn what you did  on Arrakis. They’ve  lonJ susSected how you do
business.”
   “The    only   recent  business  I   can   recall,”   the   Baron   said,  “was
transSortation oI several leJions oI Sardaukar to Arrakis.”
   “You  think you could hold that over the EmSeror’s head?”
   “I  wouldn’t  think oI it!”
   The   Count  smiled.  “Sardaukar  commanders could   be  Iound  who’d
conIess they acted without orders because they wanted a battle with your
Fremen scum.”
   “Many   miJht  doubt such a conIession,”  the Baron said,  but the threat
staJJered him. Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined? he wondered.
   “The  EmSeror does wish to audit your books,” the Count said.
   “Any  time.”
   “You  … ah … have no obMections?”
   “None.   My    CHOAM   ComSany  directorshiS  will    bear  the   closest
scrutiny.” And he thouJht: Let him bring  a false accusation against me and
have it exposed. I shall stand there, promethean, saying: “Behold me, I am
wronged. ” Then let him bring any other accusation against me, even a true

366
one. The Great Houses will  not  believe a second attack from  an accuser
once proved wrong.
   “No  doubt your books will bear the closest scrutiny,” the Count muttered.
   “Why   is the  EmSeror so interested in  e[terminatinJ  the Fremen?”  the
Baron asked.
   “You  wish the subMect to be chanJed, eh?” The Count shruJJed. “It is the
Sardaukar who wish it, not the EmSeror. They needed Sractice in killinJ …
and they hate to see a task leIt undone.”
   Does he  think to  frighten me by  reminding me that  he is supported by
bloodthirsty killers? the Baron wondered.
   “A   certain amount oI  killinJ  has always been an arm oI  business,” the
Baron said, “but a line  has to be drawn somewhere. Someone must be leIt
to work the sSice.”
   The Count emitted a short, barkinJ lauJh. “You think you can harness the
Fremen?”
   “There  never were enouJh oI  them Ior  that,”  the Baron  said. “But  the
killinJ  has made the rest oI my  SoSulation uneasy. It’s reachinJ the Soint
where I’m  considerinJ another solution to the Arrakeen Sroblem, my dear
FenrinJ.  And   I   must   conIess  the  EmSeror   deserves credit   Ior   the
insSiration.”
   “Ah-h-h?”
   “You  see, Count, I have the EmSeror’s Srison Slanet, Salusa Secundus, to
insSire me.”
   The   Count  stared  at  him   with   JlitterinJ   intensity.   “What   Sossible
connection is there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?”
   The Baron Ielt the alertness in FenrinJ’s eyes, said: “No connection yet.”
   “Yet?”
   “You  must admit  it’d  be a way  to develoS a substantial work  Iorce on
Arrakis—use the Slace as a Srison Slanet.”
   “You  anticiSate an increase in Srisoners?”
   “There  has been unrest,” the Baron admitted. “I’ve had to sTueeze rather
severely, FenrinJ. AIter all, you know the Srice I Said that damnable Guild
to transSort our  mutual Iorce  to Arrakis.  That  money has to  come Irom
somewhere.
   “I  suJJest you not use Arrakis  as a Srison Slanet without the EmSeror’s
Sermission, Baron.”

367
   “OI  course not,”  the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in
FenrinJ’s voice.
   “Another  matter,”  the Count  said. “We  learn that Duke  Leto’s Mentat,
ThuIir Hawat, is not dead but in your emSloy.”
   “I  could not brinJ myselI to waste him,” the Baron said.
   “You  lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead.”
   “Only   a  white  lie,  my  dear  Count. I   hadn’t  the stomach  Ior  a lonJ
arJument with the man.”
   “Was Hawat the real traitor?”
   “Oh,   Joodness, no!   It  was  the  Ialse  doctor.”   The  Baron  wiSed  at
SersSiration on his neck. “You must understand, FenrinJ, I  was without a
Mentat. You  know  that. I’ve  never  been without  a Mentat.  It  was most
unsettlinJ.”
   “How  could you Jet Hawat to shiIt alleJiance?”
   “His  Duke was dead.” The Baron Iorced a smile. “There’s nothinJ to Iear
Irom Hawat, my dear Count. The Mentat’s Ilesh has been imSreJnated with
a latent  Soison.  We  administer an  antidote  in   his  meals. Without   the
antidote, the Soison is triJJered—he’d die in a Iew days.”
   “Withdraw  the antidote,” the Count said.
   “But  he’s useIul!”
   “And  he knows too many thinJs no livinJ man should know.”
   “You  said the EmSeror doesn’t Iear e[Sosure.”
   “Don’t  Slay James with me, Baron!”
   “When  I see such an order above the ImSerial seal I’ll obey it,” the Baron
said. “But I’ll  not submit to your whim.”
   “You  think it whim?”
   “What  else can it be? The EmSeror has obliJations to me, too, FenrinJ. I
rid him oI the troublesome Duke.”
   “With  the helS oI a Iew Sardaukar.”
   “Where  else  would  the EmSeror  have Iound  a House  to  Srovide the
disJuisinJ uniIorms to hide his hand in this matter?”
   “He   has asked himselI  the same Tuestion, Baron,  but  with  a sliJhtly
diIIerent emShasis.”
   The  Baron  studied  FenrinJ, notinJ   the stiIIness  oI  Maw muscles, the
careIul control. “Ah-h-h, now,”  the Baron said. “I hoSe the EmSeror doesn’t
believe he can move aJainst me in total secrecy.”
   “He  hoSes it won’t become necessary.”

368
   “The  EmSeror cannot believe I threaten him!” The Baron Sermitted anJer
and JrieI  to edJe his  voice, thinkinJ:  Let  him wrong  me in  that!  I could
place myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how I’d  been
wronged.
   The  Count’s  voice  went  dry  and  remote  as he  said:  “The  EmSeror
believes what his senses tell him.”
   “Dare   the EmSeror charJe  me with   treason beIore a  Iull   Landstraad
Council?” And the Baron held his breath with the hoSe oI it.
   “The  EmSeror need dare nothinJ.”
   The Baron whirled away in his susSensors to hide his e[Sression. It could
happen in my lifetime! he thouJht. Emperor! Let him wrong me! Then—the
bribes and coercion, the rallying  of  the Great Houses: they’d  flock to  my
banner like peasants running for shelter. The thing they fear above all else
is the Emperor’s Sardaukar loosed upon them one House at a time.
   “It’s   the EmSeror’s  sincere hoSe he’ll  never have to  charJe you  with
treason,” the Count said.
   The  Baron Iound  it diIIicult   to  keeS irony out  oI his  voice and Sermit
only  the e[Sression  oI  hurt,  but  he  manaJed. “I’ve   been a  most loyal
subMect. These words hurt me beyond my caSacity to e[Sress.”
   “Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m,”   said the Count.
   The  Baron keSt his back to the Count, noddinJ.  Presently he said, “It’s
time to Jo to the arena.”
   “Indeed,”  said the Count.
   They moved out oI  the cone oI silence and, side by side, walked toward
the clumSs oI Houses Minor  at  the end oI  the hall.  A  bell beJan a slow
tollinJ   somewhere in  the  keeS—twenty-minute  warninJ   Ior  the  arena
JatherinJ.
   “The  Houses Minor wait  Ior you to lead them,”  the Count said, noddinJ
toward the SeoSle they aSSroached.
   Double meaning … double meaning, the Baron thouJht.
   He  looked  uS at the  new  talismans IlankinJ  the  e[it  to  his  hall—the
mounted bull’s head and the oil SaintinJ oI the Old Duke Atreides, the late
Duke Leto’s Iather. They Iilled  the Baron with an odd sense oI IorebodinJ,
and he wondered what thouJhts these talismans had insSired in the Duke
Leto as they hunJ in the halls oI Caladan and then on Arrakis—the bravura
Iather and the head oI the bull that had killed him.

369
   “Mankind   has ah only  one mm-m-m  science,” the  Count said as they
Sicked uS their  Sarade oI Iollowers  and  emerJed Irom  the hall  into  the
waitinJ  room—a narrow sSace with hiJh  windows  and Iloor  oI Satterned
white and SurSle tile.
   “And  what science is that?” the Baron asked.
   “It’s  the um-m-m-ah-h science oI ah-h-h discontent,” the Count said.
   The  Houses Minor  behind  them, sheeS-Iaced and resSonsive, lauJhed
with  Must the riJht tone oI  aSSreciation, but the sound carried  a note  oI
discord as it  collided with  the  sudden blast oI motors  that came to them
when SaJes threw oSen the outer doors, revealinJ the line oI Jround cars,
their Juidon Sennants whiSSinJ in a breeze.
   The  Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, “I  hoSe
you’ll  not  be  discontented with   the SerIormance oI  my  neShew today,
Count FenrinJ.”
   “I  ah-h-h am  Iilled  um-m-m only  with a hm-m-m  sense oI anticiSation,
yes,” the Count said. “Always in the ah-h-h Sroces verbal, one um-m-m ah-
h-h must consider the ah-h-h oIIice oI oriJin.”
   The Baron did  his sudden stiIIeninJ oI surSrise by stumblinJ on the Iirst
steS down Irom  the  e[it.   Proces verbal!  That  was a  report  of  a  crime
against the Imperium!
   But  the Count chuckled to  make it seem a Moke, and Satted the Baron’s
arm.
   All  the way  to the arena, thouJh, the Baron sat back amonJ the armored
cushions oI   his  car,  castinJ  covert  Jlances at  the  Count  beside  him,
wonderinJ why the EmSeror’s errand boy had thouJht it necessary to make
that Sarticular kind oI Moke in Iront oI the Houses Minor. It was obvious that
FenrinJ seldom did anythinJ he Ielt  to be unnecessary, or used two words
where one would do, or held himselI to a sinJle meaninJ in a sinJle Shrase.
   They  were seated in the Jolden  bo[  above the trianJular  arena—horns
blarinJ, the tiers above and around them Mammed with a hubbub oI SeoSle
and wavinJ Sennants—when the answer came to the Baron.
   “My   dear Baron,”  the Count said, leaninJ close to  his ear, “you  know,
don’t you, that the EmSeror has not Jiven oIIicial sanction to your choice oI
heir?”
   The  Baron Ielt  himselI  to be within  a  sudden Sersonal cone oI silence
Sroduced by his own shock. He stared at FenrinJ, barely seeinJ the Count’s
lady come throuJh the Juards beyond to Moin the Sarty in the Jolden bo[.

370
   “That’s  really why I’m  here today,” the Count said. “The EmSeror wishes
me to reSort on whether you’ve chosen a worthy successor. There’s nothinJ
like the arena to e[Sose the true Serson Irom beneath the mask, eh?”
   “The  EmSeror Sromised me Iree choice oI heir!” the Baron Jrated.
   “We  shall see,” FenrinJ said, and turned away to Jreet his lady. She sat
down, smilinJ   at the  Baron, then  JivinJ  her  attention to  the sand  Iloor
beneath them where Feyd-Rautha was emerJinJ in  Jiles  and tiJhts—the
black Jlove  and the lonJ kniIe  in  his riJht  hand, the white  Jlove and the
short kniIe in his leIt hand.
   “White  Ior  Soison, black Ior  Surity,” the Lady  FenrinJ said. “A  curious
custom, isn’t it, my love?”
   “Um-m-m-m,”   the Count said.
   The  JreetinJ  cheer liIted   Irom  the Iamily   Jalleries,  and Feyd-Rautha
Saused to acceSt it, lookinJ uS and scanninJ the Iaces—seeinJ his cousines
and cousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out-Ireyn relations. They
were so many Sink trumSet mouths yammerinJ amidst a Ilutter oI colorIul
clothinJ and banners.
   It  came to Feyd-Rautha then that the Sacked ranks oI Iaces would look
Must as avidly at his blood as at that oI the slave-Jladiator. There was not a
doubt oI the  outcome in this  IiJht,  oI  course. Here was only the  Iorm oI
danJer without its substance—yet….
   Feyd-Rautha held uS his knives  to the sun, saluted the three corners oI
the arena in  the  ancient manner. The  short  kniIe  in  white-Jloved  hand
(white, the siJn oI Soison) went Iirst into  its sheath. Then the lonJ blade in
the black-Jloved  hand—the Sure blade  that now  was unSure, his  secret
weaSon to turn this day into a Surely Sersonal victory: Soison on the black
blade.
   The adMustment oI his body shield took only a moment, and he Saused to
sense the skin-tiJhteninJ  at  his  Iorehead assurinJ him  he  was SroSerly
Juarded.
   This  moment carried its own  susSense, and Feyd-Rautha draJJed it out
with the sure hand oI a showman, noddinJ to  his handlers and distractors,
checkinJ their eTuiSment with a measurinJ stare—Jyves in Slace with their
Srickles sharS and JlisteninJ, the barbs and hooks wavinJ with  their  blue
streamers.
   Feyd-Rautha siJnaled the musicians.

371
   The slow march beJan, sonorous with its ancient SomS, and Feyd-Rautha
led his trouSe across the arena Ior obeisance at the Ioot oI his uncle’s bo[.
He cauJht the ceremonial key as it was thrown.
   The music stoSSed.
   Into  the abruSt silence, he steSSed back two Saces, raised the key and
shouted. “I  dedicate this truth  to….”  And  he  Saused, knowinJ his uncle
would think:  The young fool’s going to  dedicate to Lady Fenring  after all
and cause a ruckus!
   “…   to  my  uncle and  Satron, the Baron  Vladimir   Harkonnen!”  Feyd-
Rautha shouted.
   And  he was deliJhted to see his uncle siJh.
   The  music resumed at the  Tuick-march, and Feyd-Rautha led his  men
scamSerinJ back across the arena to the Srudence door that admitted only
those wearinJ the SroSer identiIication band. Feyd-Rautha Srided himselI
that he never used the Sru-door and seldom needed distractors. But it was
Jood  to  know  they  were  available  this  day—sSecial  Slans sometimes
involved sSecial danJers.
   AJain,  silence settled over the arena.
   Feyd-Rautha turned,  Iaced the  biJ  red door  across Irom  him  throuJh
which the Jladiator would emerJe.
   The sSecial Jladiator.
   The  Slan ThuIir  Hawat  had devised was admirably  simSle and direct,
Feyd-Rautha thouJht.  The  slave  would  not  be  druJJed—that  was  the
danJer. Instead, a key word had been drummed into the man’s unconscious
to immobilize his  muscles at a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the vital
word in his  mind, mouthinJ it  without  sound: “Scum!”  To the audience, it
would aSSear that an undruJJed slave had been sliSSed into the arena to kill
the na-Baron. And all  the careIully  arranJed evidence would Soint to  the
slavemaster.
   A  low  humminJ  arose Irom  the red door’s  servo-motors as they were
armed Ior oSeninJ.
   Feyd-Rautha Iocused all  his awareness on the door. This  Iirst  moment
was the critical one. The aSSearance oI the Jladiator as he emerJed told the
trained eye much it  needed to know.  All  Jladiators  were suSSosed to be
hySed on elacca druJ to  come out kill-ready  in  IiJhtinJ   stance—but you
had to watch how they heIted the kniIe, which way they turned in  deIense,

372
whether they were actually aware oI the audience in the stands. The way a
slave cocked his head could Jive the most vital clue to counter and Ieint.
   The red door slammed oSen.
   Out  charJed a tall,  muscular  man with  shaved head and darkly  Sitted
eyes. His skin was carrot-colored as it should be Irom the elacca druJ, but
Feyd-Rautha knew the color was Saint. The slave wore Jreen leotards and
the red belt oI  a semishield—the belt’s arrow  SointinJ leIt  to indicate the
slave’s leIt  side was  shielded. He  held  his kniIe   sword-Iashion, cocked
sliJhtly outward in  the stance oI a trained IiJhter. Slowly, he advanced into
the arena, turninJ his shielded side toward Feyd-Rautha and the JrouS at the
Sru-door.
   “I   like  not the look  oI  this one,”  said one oI  Feyd-Rautha’s barb-men.
“Are you sure he’s druJJed, m’Lord?”
   “He  has the color,” Feyd-Rautha said.
   “Yet  he stands like a IiJhter,” said another helSer.
   Feyd-Rautha advanced two steSs onto the sand, studied this slave.
   “What  has he done to his arm?” asked one oI the distractors.
   Feyd-Rautha’s  attention went  to  a  bloody  scratch  on  the  man’s leIt
Iorearm, Iollowed the arm down to the hand as it Sointed to a desiJn drawn
in  blood  on the  leIt  hiS  oI  the  Jreen leotards—a wet  shaSe there: the
Iormalized outline oI a hawk.
   Hawk!
   Feyd-Rautha looked uS into the  darkly Sitted eyes, saw them JlarinJ  at
him with uncommon alertness.
   It’s  one of  Duke Leto’s fighting  men we took  on Arrakis!  Feyd-Rautha
thouJht.  No  simple  gladiator   this!   A  chill    ran  throuJh  him,   and  he
wondered iI Hawat had another Slan Ior  this arena—a Ieint within  a Ieint
within a Ieint. And only the slavemaster SreSared to take the blame!
   Feyd-Rautha’s chieI handler sSoke at his ear: “I like not the look on that
one, m’Lord. Let me set a barb or two in his kniIe arm to try him.”
   “I’ll    set my own  barbs,” Feyd-Rautha said. He took a Sair oI  the lonJ,
hooked shaIts Irom  the handler,  heIted them, testinJ  the balance. These
barbs, too, were suSSosed to be druJJed—but not this time, and the chieI
handler miJht die because oI that. But it was all Sart oI the Slan.
   “You’ll   come out of this a hero, ” Hawat had said. “Killed your gladiator
man to man and in spite of treachery. The slavemaster will be executed and
your man will step into his spot. ”

373
   Feyd-Rautha advanced another Iive Saces into the arena, SlayinJ out the
moment, studyinJ the  slave. Already,  he knew, the e[Serts  in  the stands
above him were aware that  somethinJ was wronJ.  The Jladiator  had the
correct skin color Ior  a druJJed man, but he stood his Jround and did  not
tremble. The  aIicionados would   be whisSerinJ  amonJ themselves now:
“See how he  stands. He should be  aJitated—attackinJ or  retreatinJ. See
how he conserves his strenJth, how he waits. He should not wait.”
   Feyd-Rautha Ielt  his  own e[citement  kindle.  Let there  be treachery in
Hawat’s mind, he thought. I  can handle this  slave. And it’s my  long knife
that carries  the poison this  time,  not the short  one. Even Hawat  doesn’t
know that.
   “Hai,  Harkonnen!” the slave called. “Are you SreSared to die?”
   Deathly stillness JriSSed the arena. Slaves did not issue the challenge!
   Now,  Feyd-Rautha had a clear view oI the Jladiator’s eyes, saw the cold
Ierocity oI  desSair in them. He marked the way  the man stood, loose and
ready, muscles  SreSared Ior  victory.  The   slave JraSevine  had  carried
Hawat’s messaJe to this one: “You’ll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron.
” That much oI the scheme was as they’d Slanned it, then.
   A  tiJht  smile crossed Feyd-Rautha’s mouth. He liIted  the barbs, seeinJ
success Ior his Slans in the way the Jladiator stood.
   “Hai!  Hai!”  the slave challenJed, and creSt Iorward two steSs.
   No one in the galleries can mistake it now, Feyd-Rautha thouJht.
   This slave should have been Sartly criSSled by druJ-induced terror. Every
movement should have  betrayed his inner  knowledJe  that there  was no
hoSe Ior him—he could not win. He should have been Iilled with the stories
oI the Soisons the na-Baron chose Ior the blade in his white-Jloved  hand.
The na-Baron never Jave Tuick death; he deliJhted  in demonstratinJ rare
Soisons, could stand in the arena SointinJ out interestinJ side eIIects on a
writhinJ victim.  There was Iear in the slave, yes—but not terror.
   Feyd-Rautha liIted the barbs hiJh, nodded in an almost-JreetinJ.
   The Jladiator Sounced.
   His  Ieint  and deIensive counter were as Jood as any  Feyd-Rautha had
ever seen. A timed side blow  missed by the barest Iraction Irom  severinJ
the tendons oI the na-Baron’s leIt leJ.
   Feyd-Rautha danced away, leavinJ  a  barbed shaIt in  the  slave’s riJht
Iorearm, the hooks  comSletely buried  in Ilesh  where the  man could  not
withdraw thim without riSSinJ tendons.

374
   A  concerted JasS liIted Irom the Jalleries.
   The sound Iilled Feyd-Rautha with elation.
   He knew  now what his uncle was e[SeriencinJ, sittinJ  uS there with the
FenrinJs, the observers Irom the ImSerial Court, beside him. There could be
no interIerence with  this  IiJht.   The Iorms  must be  observed in  Iront  oI
witnesses. And the Baron would interSret the events in the arena only one
way—threat to himselI.
   The slave backed, holdinJ kniIe  in  teeth and lashinJ the barbed shaIt to
his arm with the Sennant. “I do not Ieel your needle!” he shouted. AJain he
creSt Iorward, kniIe  ready, leIt side Sresented, his body bent backward to
Jive it the Jreatest surIace oI Srotection Irom the halI-shield.
   That  action, too, didn’t  escaSe the Jalleries. SharS cries came Irom the
Iamily bo[es.  Feyd-Rautha’s handlers were callinJ out to ask iI  he needed
them.
   He waved them back to the Sru-door.
   I’ll   give  them a  show such as they’ve  never had  before, Feyd-Rautha
thouJht. No  tame killing   where they  can sit  back and  admire  the style.
This’ll  be something to  take them by the  guts and twist  them. When I’m
Baron they’ll remember this day and won’t be a one of them can escape fear
of me because of this day.
   Feyd-Rautha Jave Jround slowly beIore the Jladiator’s crablike advance.
Arena sand Jrated underIoot. He heard the slave’s SantinJ, smelled his own
sweat and a Iaint odor oI blood on the air.
   Steadily, the na-Baron moved backward, turninJ to  the riJht, his  second
barb ready. The slave danced sideways. Feyd-Rautha aSSeared to stumble,
heard the scream Irom the Jalleries.
   AJain,  the slave Sounced.
   Gods,  what a  fighting  man!  Feyd-Rautha thouJht  as he leaSed aside.
Only youth’s Tuickness saved him, but he leIt the second barb buried in the
deltoid muscle oI the slave’s riJht arm.
   Shrill  cheers rained Irom the Jalleries.
   They cheer me now, Feyd-Rautha thouJht. He heard the wildness in the
voices Must as Hawat had said he would. They’d  never cheered a Iamily
IiJhter that way beIore. And he thouJht with an edJe oI Jrimness on a thinJ
Hawat had told him: “It’s easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.”
   SwiItly,  Feyd-Rautha retreated to the center oI the arena where all could
see clearly. He drew his lonJ blade, crouched and waited Ior the advancinJ

375
slave.
   The man took only the time to lash the second barb tiJht to his arm, then
sSed in Sursuit.
   Let  the family  see me  do this  thing,  Feyd-Rautha thouJht. I  am  their
enemy: let them think of me as they see me now.
   He drew his short blade.
   “I  do  not Iear you, Harkonnen swine,” the Jladiator  said. “Your tortures
cannot hurt a dead man. I can be dead on my own blade beIore a handler
lays IinJer to my Ilesh. And I’ll  have you dead beside me!”
   Feyd-Rautha  Jrinned,  oIIered now   the lonJ   blade, the  one  with  the
Soison. “Try this on,”  he said, and Ieinted with the short blade in his other
hand.
   The  slave  shiIted  kniIe  hands, turned  inside both  Sarry  and Ieint  to
JraSSle the na-Baron’s short blade—the one in the white Jloved hand that
tradition said should carry the Soison.
   “You  will  die, Harkonnen,” the Jladiator JasSed.
   They  struJJled  sideways across the sand. Where Feyd-Rautha’s shield
met the slave’s halIshield, a blue Jlow marked the contact. The air around
them Iilled with ozone Irom the Iield.
   “Die  on your own Soison!” the slave Jrated.
   He  beJan IorcinJ  the  white-Jloved  hand inward,  turninJ  the blade he
thouJht carried the Soison.
   Let them see this! Feyd-Rautha thouJht. He brouJht down the lonJ blade,
Ielt it clanJ uselessly aJainst the barbed shaIt lashed to the slave’s arm.
   Feyd-Rautha  Ielt  a  moment  oI  desSeration. He  had not  thouJht  the
barbed shaIts would be an advantaJe Ior the slave. But they Jave the man
another shield. And the strenJth oI this Jladiator! The short blade was beinJ
Iorced inward ine[orably,  and Feyd-Rautha Iocused on the Iact that a man
could also die on an unSoisoned blade.
   “Scum!”  Feyd-Rautha JasSed.
   At   the key  word,   the Jladiator’s  muscles  obeyed with  a  momentary
slackness. It was enouJh Ior Feyd-Rautha. He oSened a sSace between them
suIIicient Ior  the lonJ  blade. Its  Soisoned tiS Ilicked out,  drew a red line
down the slave’s chest. There was instant  aJony in  the Soison. The man
disenJaJed himselI, staJJered backward.
   Now, let my dear  family watch, Feyd-Rautha thought. Let them think on
this slave who tried to turn the knife he thought poisoned and use it against

376
me. Let them wonder how a gladiator could come into this arena ready for
such an attempt. And let them always be aware they cannot know for sure
which of my hands carries the poison.
   Feyd-Rautha stood in silence, watchinJ the slowed motions oI the slave.
The man moved within a hesitation-awareness. There was an orthoJraShic
thinJ on his Iace now Ior every watcher to recoJnize. The death was written
there. The slave knew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been
done. The wronJ blade had carried the Soison.
   “You!”  the man moaned.
   Feyd-Rautha drew back to  Jive death its sSace. The SaralyzinJ druJ in
the Soison had yet to  take Iull   eIIect, but  the man’s slowness told  oI its
advance.
   The slave staJJered Iorward as thouJh drawn by a strinJ—one draJJinJ
steS at a time. Each steS was the only steS in his universe. He still clutched
his kniIe, but its Soint wavered.
   “One day … one … oI us … will  … Jet … you,”  he JasSed.
   A  sad little moue contorted his mouth. He sat, saJJed, then stiIIened and
rolled away Irom Feyd-Rautha, Iace down.
   Feyd-Rautha advanced in the silent arena, Sut a toe under the Jladiator
and rolled him onto  his back to Jive  the Jalleries a clear view  oI the Iace
when the Soison beJan its twistinJ, wrenchinJ work on the muscles. But the
Jladiator came over with his own kniIe, SrotrudinJ Irom his breast.
   In   sSite  oI   Irustration,   there  was  Ior    Feyd-Rautha a   measure oI
admiration  Ior   the  eIIort  this   slave  had  manaJed in   overcominJ  the
Saralysis to  do   this  thinJ   to  himselI.   With  the  admiration   came the
realization that here was truly a thinJ to Iear.
   That which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.
   As  he Iocused  on this  thouJht, Feyd-Rautha became conscious oI  the
eruStion oI  noise Irom  the  stands and Jalleries  around him.  They  were
cheerinJ with utter abandon.
   Feyd-Rautha turned, lookinJ uS at them.
   All   were cheerinJ e[ceSt the Baron, who  sat with hand to chin  in deeS
contemSlation—and the Count and his  lady, both  oI  whom  were starinJ
down at him, their Iaces masked by smiles.
   Count  FenrinJ turned to his  lady, said: “Ah-h-h-um-m-m,  a  resourceIul
um-m-m-m younJ man. Eh, mm-m-m-ah, my dear?”
   “His  ah-h-h synaStic resSonses are very swiIt,” she said.

377
   The Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the arena,
thinkinJ:  If  someone could get that close to  one of mine!  RaJe beJan to
reSlace his Iear. I’ll have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night…
and if this Count and his lady had a hand in it….
   The  conversation in  the Baron’s  bo[  was  remote movement to  Feyd-
Rautha, the voices drowned in the Ioot-stamSinJ chant that came now Irom
all around:
   “Head!  Head! Head! Head!”
   The   Baron  scowled,   seeinJ  the  way   Feyd-Rautha  turned  to   him.
LanJuidly, controllinJ   his raJe with  diIIiculty,   the Baron waved his  hand
toward the younJ man standinJ in the arena beside the sSrawled body oI the
slave. Give the boy a head. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster.
   Feyd-Rautha saw the siJnal oI aJreement, thouJht: They think they honor
me. Let them see what I think!
   He  saw his  handlers aSSroachinJ with  a saw-kniIe  to  do  the honors,
waved them back, reSeated the Jesture as they hesitated. They think they
honor me with just a head! he thouJht. He bent and crossed the Jladiator’s
hands around the  SrotrudinJ  kniIe  handle, then  removed the  kniIe  and
Slaced it in the limS hands.
   It  was  done in an  instant, and he straiJhtened, beckoned his handlers.
“Bury  this  slave intact  with  his  kniIe  in  his hands,”  he said. “The  man
earned it.”
   In  the Jolden  bo[,  Count  FenrinJ leaned close to  the Baron,  said: “A
Jrand  Jesture, that—true  bravura.  Your   neShew has  style  as well   as
couraJe.”
   “He  insults the crowd by reIusinJ the head,” the Baron muttered.
   “Not  at all,”  Lady FenrinJ said. She turned, lookinJ uS at the tiers around
them.
   And  the  Baron noted  the line  oI  her neck—a  truly  lovely  IlowinJ   oI
muscles—like a younJ boy’s.
   “They  like what your neShew did,” she said.
   As  the imSort  oI  Feyd-Rautha’s Jesture Senetrated to the most distant
seats, as the SeoSle saw the handlers carryinJ oII the dead Jladiator intact,
the Baron  watched  them and  realized  she had  interSreted the  reaction
correctly. The SeoSle were JoinJ  wild,  beatinJ on  each other, screaminJ
and stamSinJ.

378
   The Baron sSoke wearily. “I  shall have to order a Iete. You cannot send
SeoSle home like this, their  enerJies unsSent. They must see that I share
their elation.” He Jave a hand siJnal to his Juard, and a servant above them
diSSed the Harkonnen oranJe Sennant over  the bo[—once,  twice,  three
times—siJnal Ior a Iete.
   Feyd-Rautha crossed the  arena to  stand beneath the  Jolden  bo[,   his
weaSons sheathed, arms hanJinJ at  his  sides. Above  the  undiminished
Irenzy oI the crowd, he called: “A Iete, Uncle?”
   The noise beJan to subside as SeoSle saw the conversation and waited.
   “In  your honor, Feyd!”  the Baron called down. And aJain, he caused the
Sennant to be diSSed in siJnal.
   Across the arena, the Sru-barriers had been droSSed and younJ men were
leaSinJ down into the arena, racinJ toward Feyd-Rautha.
   “You  ordered the Sru-shields droSSed, Baron?” the Count asked.
   “No  one will harm the lad,” the Baron said. “He’s a hero.”
   The Iirst  oI  the charJinJ mass reached Feyd-Rautha, liIted him on their
shoulders, beJan SaradinJ around the arena.
   “He  could walk  unarmed and unshielded throuJh the Soorest Tuarters oI
Harko toniJht,”  the Baron said. “They’d Jive him  the last oI their Iood and
drink Must Ior his comSany.”
   The  Baron  Sushed himselI Irom  his  chair, settled  his weiJht  into  his
susSensors. “You will IorJive me, Slease. There are matters that reTuire my
immediate attention. The Juard will see you to the keeS.”
   The Count arose, bowed. “Certainly, Baron. We’re lookinJ Iorward to the
Iete. I’ve ah-h-h-mm-m-m never seen a Harkonnen Iete.”
   “Yes,”  the Baron said. “The Iete.” He turned, was enveloSed by Juards as
he steSSed into the Srivate e[it Irom the bo[.
   A  Juard caStain bowed to Count FenrinJ. “Your orders, my Lord?”
   “We  will  ah-h-h wait Ior the worst mm-m-m crush to um-m-m Sass,” the
Count said.
   “Yes, m’Lord.”  The man bowed himselI back three Saces.
   Count  FenrinJ Iaced his  lady, sSoke aJain in  their Sersonal humminJ-
code tonJue: “You saw it, oI course?”
   In  the  same humminJ  tonJue, she  said: “The  lad  knew  the Jladiator
wouldn’t be druJJed. There was a moment oI Iear, yes, but no surSrise.”
   “It  was Slanned,” he said. “The entire SerIormance.”
   “Without  a doubt.”

379
   “It  stinks oI Hawat.”
   “Indeed,”  she said.
   “I  demanded earlier that the Baron eliminate Hawat.”
   “That  was an error, my dear.”
   “I  see that now.”
   “The  Harkonnens may have a new Baron ere lonJ.”
   “II  that’s Hawat’s Slan.”
   “That  will  bear e[amination, true,” she said.
   “The  younJ one will be more amenable to control.”
   “For  us … aIter toniJht,” she said.
   “You  don’t anticiSate diIIiculty seducinJ him, my little  brood-mother?”
   “No,  my love. You saw how he looked at me.”
   “Yes, and I can see now why we must have that bloodline.”
   “Indeed,  and it’s obvious we must have a hold on him. I’ll   Slant deeS in
his deeSest selI the necessary Srana-bindu Shrases to bend him.”
   “We’ll  leave as soon as Sossible—as soon as you’re sure,” he said.
   She shuddered. “By all  means. I should not want to  bear a child in  this
terrible Slace.”
   “The  thinJs we do in the name oI humanity,” he said.
   “Yours is the easy Sart,” she said.
   “There are some ancient SreMudices I overcome,” he said. “They’re Tuite
Srimordial, you know.”
   “My   Soor dear,” she said, and Satted his cheek. “You  know this  is the
only way to be sure oI savinJ that bloodline.”
   He sSoke in a dry voice: “I Tuite understand what we do.”
   “We won’t  Iail,”  she said.
   “Guilt  starts as a IeelinJ oI Iailure,” he reminded.
   “There’ll   be no Juilt,”   she said. “HySno-liJation  oI  that Feyd-Rautha’s
Ssyche and his child in my womb—then we Jo.”
   “That  uncle,” he said. “Have you ever seen such distortion?”
   “He’s  Sretty  Iierce,”  she said, “but  the neShew could well  Jrow  to  be
worse.”
   “Thanks  to that uncle. You know, when you think what this lad could’ve
been with some other uSbrinJinJ—with the Atreides code to Juide him, Ior
e[amSle.”
   “It’s  sad,” she said.

380
   “Would   that we  could’ve saved both  the Atreides  youth and  this one.
From what I heard oI that younJ Paul—a most admirable lad, Jood union oI
breedinJ and traininJ.” He shook his head. “But we shouldn’t waste sorrow
over the aristocracy oI misIortune.”
   “There’s a Bene Gesserit sayinJ,” she said.
   “You  have sayinJs Ior everythinJ!” he Srotested.
   “You’ll   like  this  one,” she said. “It  Joes: ‘Do  not  count a human dead
until you’ve seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.’ ”

381
        MuadDib tells us in “A Time of Reflection” that his first collisions with Arrakeen necessities
        were the true beginnings of his education. He learned then how to pole the sand for its
        weather, learned the language of the wind‘s needles stinging his skin, learned how the nose
        can buzz with sand-itch and how to gather his body’s precious moisture around him to guard it
        and preserve it. As his eyes assumed the blue of the Ibad, he teamed the Chakobsa way.
                                           —StilJar’s preface to “Muad’Dib, the Man” by the Princess Irulan



 
  STILGAR’S    TROOP   returninJ     to  the  sietch   with    its  two   strays   Irom   the
desert  climbed    out  oI  the  basin   in  the  waninJ    liJht   oI   the  Iirst   moon.   The
robed  IiJures   hurried   with   the  smell   oI  home  in   their  nostrils.    Dawn’s   Jray
line  behind    them  was   briJhtest   at  the   notch  in   their   horizon-calendar     that
marked  the  middle   oI  autumn,  the  month   oI CaSrock.
    Wind-raked     dead  leaves  strewed   the  cliIIbase    where   the  sietch   children
had been  JatherinJ    them,   but  the  sounds  oI  the  trooS’s   SassaJe  (e[ceSt   Ior
occasional   blunderinJs    by  Paul   and  his  mother)   could   not  be  distinJuished
Irom  the  natural  sounds  oI  the  niJht.
    Paul   wiSed   sweat-caked    dust  Irom    his  Iorehead,    Ielt   a  tuJ   at  his  arm,
heard  Chani’s   voice  hissinJ.    “Do   as I  told  you:   brinJ   the  Iold   oI  your  hood
down    over   your    Iorehead!     Leave    only    the    eyes   e[Sosed.    You    waste
moisture.”
    A  whisSered   command   behind   them  demanded  silence:   “The   desert  hears
you!”
    A  bird  chirruSed   Irom   the  rocks  hiJh  above  them.
    The  trooS  stoSSed,  and Paul  sensed  abruSt  tension.
    There  came  a Iaint   thumSinJ   Irom   the  rocks,  a sound  no  louder   than  mice
MumSinJ in the  sand.
    AJain,   the  bird  chirruSed.
    A  stir   Sassed throuJh    the trooS’s   ranks.   And  aJain,   the  mouse-thumSinJ
Secked its  way  across  the  sand.
    Once  more,  the  bird  chirruSed.
    The  trooS  resumed   its  climb   uS into   a crack   in  the  rocks,  but  there  was  a
stillness   oI  breath  about   the  Fremen   now  that   Iilled   Paul  with   caution,    and
he  noted  covert    Jlances   toward   Chani,    the  way   she  seemed  to   withdraw,
SullinJ   in  uSon herselI.

382
   There  was rock underIoot  now, a  Iaint  Jray swishinJ  oI  robes around
them, and Paul sensed a rela[inJ  oI  disciSline, but still   that Tuiet-oI-the-
Serson about Chani and the others. He Iollowed a shadow shaSe—uS steSs,
a turn, more steSs, into a tunnel, Sast two moisture-sealed doors and into a
JlobeliJhted narrow SassaJe with yellow rock walls and ceilinJ.
   All    around him,   Paul  saw  the  Fremen  throwinJ  back  their   hoods,
removinJ nose SluJs, breathinJ deeSly. Someone siJhed. Paul looked Ior
Chani, Iound that she had leIt  his side. He  was hemmed in by  a Sress oI
robed bodies. Someone Mostled him, said, “E[cuse me, Usul. What a crush!
It’s always this way.”
   On  his  leIt,  the  narrow  bearded Iace oI  the  one called  Farok  turned
toward Paul. The stained eyeSits and blue darkness oI eyes aSSeared even
darker under the yellow Jlobes. “Throw  oII  your hood, Usul,”  Farok said.
“You’re home.”  And he helSed Paul, releasinJ the hood catch, elbowinJ a
sSace around them.
   Paul sliSSed out his nose SluJs, swunJ the mouth baIIle aside. The odor
oI the Slace assailed him: unwashed bodies, distillate esthers oI reclaimed
wastes, everywhere the  sour  eIIluvia   oI  humanity  with,   over  it  all,   a
turbulence oI sSice and sSicelike harmonics.
   “Why  are we waitinJ, Farok?” Paul asked.
   “For   the  Reverend  Mother,  I   think.   You  heard the   messaJe—Soor
Chani.”
   Poor  Chani?  Paul asked himselI. He  looked around, wonderinJ  where
she was, where his mother had Jot to in all this crush.
   Farok took a deeS breath. “The smells oI home,” he said.
   Paul saw that the man was enMoyinJ the stink oI this air, that there was no
irony in his tone. He heard his mother couJh then, and her voice came back
to him throuJh  the Sress oI the trooS: “How rich  the odors oI your sietch,
StilJar. I  see you do much workinJ  with  the sSice … you make SaSer …
Slastics … and isn’t that chemical e[Slosives?”
   “You  know this Irom what you smell?” It was another man’s voice.
   And  Paul realized she was sSeakinJ Ior his beneIit that she wanted him to
make a Tuick acceStance oI this assault on his nostrils.
   There came a buzz oI  activity  at the head oI the trooS and a SrolonJed
indrawn breath that  seemed to Sass throuJh the Fremen, and Paul heard
hushed voices back down the line: “It’s true then—Liet is dead.”

383
   Liet, Paul thouJht. Then: Chani, daughter of Liet. The Sieces Iell toJether
in his mind. Liet was the Fremen name oI the SlanetoloJist.
   Paul looked at Farok, asked: “Is it the Liet known as Kynes?”
   “There is only  one Liet,” Farok said.
   Paul turned, stared at the robed back oI a Fremen in Iront  oI  him. Then
Liet-Kynes is dead, he thouJht.
   “It   was Harkonnen treachery,” someone hissed. “They made it seem an
accident … lost in the desert … a ’thoSter crash….”
   Paul Ielt a burst oI anJer. The man who had beIriended them, helSed save
them Irom   the Harkonnen  hunters, the  man  who  had sent  his Fremen
cohorts searchinJ Ior  two  strays  in  the desert …  another  victim  oI  the
Harkonnens.
   “Does Usul hunJer yet Ior revenJe?” Farok asked.
   BeIore  Paul could  answer, there came a low  call  and the  trooS sweSt
Iorward into a wider chamber, carryinJ Paul with them. He Iound himselI in
an oSen sSace conIronted  by  StilJar  and  a  stranJe woman  wearinJ  a
IlowinJ  wraSaround Jarment oI brilliant  oranJe and Jreen. Her arms were
bare to the shoulders, and he could see she wore no stillsuit. Her skin was a
Sale olive. Dark hair sweSt back Irom her hiJh Iorehead, throwinJ emShasis
on sharS cheekbones and aTuiline nose between the dense darkness oI her
eyes.
   She turned toward him,  and Paul saw Jolden rinJs  threaded with water
tallies danJlinJ Irom her ears.
   “This  bested my Jamis?” she demanded.
   “Be  silent,  Harah,” StilJar  said. “It   was Jamis’ doinJ—he  invoked the
tahaddi al-burhan.”
   “He’s  not but a boy!” she said. She Jave her head a sharS shake Irom side
to side, settinJ the water tallies to MinJlinJ. “My children made Iatherless by
another child? Surely, ’twas an accident!”
   “Usul,  how many years have you?” StilJar asked.
   “FiIteen  standard,” Paul said.
   StilJar  sweSt his eyes over the trooS. “Is there one amonJ you cares to
challenJe me?”
   Silence.
   StilJar  looked at the woman. “Until   I’ve  learned his weirdinJ ways, I’d
not challenJe him.”
   She returned his stare. “But—”

384
   “You  saw  the stranJer woman  who went  with  Chani  to the  Reverend
Mother?” StilJar  asked. “She’s an out-Ireyn Sayyadina, mother to this lad.
The mother and son are masters oI the weirdinJ ways oI battle.”
   “Lisan  al-Gaib,”  the woman whisSered. Her eyes held awe as she turned
them back toward Paul.
   The legend again, Paul thouJht.
   “PerhaSs,” StilJar  said. “It  hasn’t been tested, thouJh.” He returned his
attention to Paul. “Usul, it’s our way  that you’ve now the resSonsibility Ior
Jamis’ woman here and Ior his two sons. His yali … his Tuarters, are yours.
His coIIee service is yours … and this, his woman.”
   Paul studied the woman,  wonderinJ: Why isn’t  she mourning her man?
Why does she show no hate for me? AbruStly, he saw that the Fremen were
starinJ at him, waitinJ.
   Someone whisSered: “There’s work to do. Say how you acceSt her.”
   StilJar  said: “Do you acceSt Harah as woman or servant?”
   Harah  liIted  her arms,  turninJ  slowly  on one  heel. “I  am  still  younJ,
Usul. It’s  said I  still  look  as younJ as when  I was  with  GeoII …  beIore
Jamis bested him.”
   Jamis killed another to win her, Paul thouJht.
   Paul said: “II  I acceSt her as servant, may I yet chanJe my mind at a later
time?”
   “You’d   have a year to chanJe your  decision,” StilJar  said. “AIter   that,
she’s a Iree woman to  choose as she wishes … or  you could  Iree her to
choose Ior herselI at any time. But she’s your resSonsibility, no matter what,
Ior one year … and you’ll  always share some resSonsibility Ior the sons oI
Jamis.”
   “I  acceSt her as servant,” Paul said.
   Harah stamSed a Ioot, shook her shoulders with anJer. “But I’m younJ!”
   StilJar  looked  at Paul, said: “Caution’s  a worthy  trait  in  a man who’d
lead.”
   “But  I’m  younJ!”  Harah reSeated.
   “Be  silent,” StilJar  commanded. “II a thinJ has merit, it’ll  be. Show Usul
to his Tuarters and see he has Iresh clothinJ and a Slace to rest.”
   “Oh-h-h-h!”   she said.
   Paul had reJistered enouJh oI her to have a Iirst  aSSro[imation. He Ielt
the imSatience oI the trooS, knew many thinJs were beinJ delayed here. He

385
wondered iI he  dared ask the whereabouts oI his mother  and Chani, saw
Irom StilJar’s nervous stance that it would be a mistake.
   He  Iaced Harah, Sitched his voice with  tone and tremolo  to accent her
Iear and awe, said: “Show  me my  Tuarters, Harah! We will  discuss your
youth another time.”
   She backed away two steSs, cast a IriJhtened Jlance at StilJar. “He has
the weirdinJ voice,” she husked.
   “StilJar,”  Paul said. “Chani’s Iather Sut heavy obliJation on me. II there’s
anythinJ….”
   “It’ll    be  decided in  council,”  StilJar  said.  “You  can sSeak then.”  He
nodded in dismissal, turned away with the rest oI the trooS IollowinJ him.
   Paul  took Harah’s arm,  notinJ  how cool  her Ilesh  seemed, IeelinJ her
tremble. “I’ll  not harm you, Harah,”  he said. “Show me our Tuarters.” And
he smoothed his voice with rela[ants.
   “You’ll   not cast me out when the year’s Jone?” she said. “I know Ior true
I’m not as younJ as once I was.”
   “As  lonJ as I live  you’ll  have a Slace with me,” he said. He released her
arm. “Come now, where are our Tuarters?”
   She turned, led the way down the SassaJe, turninJ riJht into a wide cross
tunnel liJhted  by evenly  sSaced yellow overhead Jlobes. The stone Iloor
was smooth, sweSt clean oI sand.
   Paul  moved uS beside her, studied the aTuiline SroIile  as they walked.
“You do not hate me, Harah?”
   “Why  should I hate you?”
   She nodded to a cluster oI  children who  stared at them Irom the  raised
ledJe oI  a side SassaJe. Paul JlimSsed adult shaSes behind the children
Sartly hidden by Iilmy hanJinJs.
   “I…  bested Jamis.”
   “StilJar  said the ceremony was held and you’re  a Iriend oI  Jamis.” She
Jlanced sidelonJ at him. “StilJar said you Jave moisture to the dead. Is that
truth?”
   “Yes.”
   “It’s  more than I’ll  do … can do.”
   “Don’t  you mourn him?”
   “In  the time oI mourninJ, I’ll  mourn him.”
   They  Sassed an arched oSeninJ.  Paul looked  throuJh  it   at men  and
women workinJ with  stand-mounted machinery in a larJe, briJht chamber.

386
There seemed an e[tra temSo oI urJency to them.
   “What’re  they doinJ in there?” Paul asked.
   She Jlanced back as they Sassed beyond the arch, said: “They hurry to
Iinish the  Tuota in the  Slastics shoS beIore we Ilee. We  need many dew
collectors Ior the SlantinJ.”
   “Flee?”
   “Until   the butchers stoS huntinJ  us or are driven  Irom  our land.”  Paul
cauJht  himselI   in   a   stumble,  sensinJ   an  arrested  instant   oI   time,
rememberinJ a  IraJment, a  visual  SroMection oI Srescience—but it  was
disSlaced, like a montaJe in motion. The bits oI his Srescient memory were
not Tuite as he remembered them.
   “The  Sardaukar hunt us,” he said.
   “They’ll    not Iind   much e[ceStinJ  an  emSty sietch or  two,”  she  said.
“And they’ll  Iind their share oI death in the sand.”
   “They’ll   Iind this Slace?” he asked.
   “Likely.”
   “Yet  we take the time to….”  He motioned with his head toward the arch
now Iar behind them. “… make … dew collectors?”
   “The  SlantinJ Joes on.”
   “What’re  dew collectors?” he asked.
   The Jlance she turned on him was Iull oI surSrise. “Don’t they teach you
anythinJ in the… wherever it is you come Irom?”
   “Not  about dew collectors.”
   “Hai!”   she said, and there was a whole conversation in the one word.
   “Well,  what are they?”
   “Each  bush, each weed you see out there in the erJ,” she said, “how do
you suSSose it lives when we leave it? Each is Slanted most tenderly in its
own little Sit. The Sits are Iilled  with smooth ovals oI chromoSlastic. LiJht
turns them white. You can see them JlisteninJ in the dawn iI you look down
Irom a  hiJh Slace. White  reIlects. But  when Old  Father Sun deSarts, the
chromoSlastic reverts to transSarency in  the dark.  It  cools with  e[treme
raSidity. The  surIace condenses moisture  out  oI  the  air. That  moisture
trickles down to keeS our Slants alive.”
   “Dew  collectors,” he muttered, enchanted by the simSle beauty oI such a
scheme.
   “I’ll   mourn Jamis in the SroSer time Ior it,” she said, as thouJh her mind
had not leIt  his other Tuestion. “He  was a Jood man, Jamis, but Tuick  to

387
anJer. A Jood Srovider, Jamis, and a wonder with the children. He made no
seSaration between GeoII’s boy, my Iirstborn, and his own true son. They
were eTual in his eyes.” She turned a TuestinJ stare on Paul. “Would it be
that way with you, Usul?”
   “We don’t  have that Sroblem.”
   “But  iI—”
   “Harah!”
   She recoiled at the harsh edJe in his voice.
   They  Sassed another briJhtly liJhted  room  visible  throuJh  an arch on
their leIt. “What’s made there?” he asked.
   “They   reSair  the   weavinJ  machinery,”   she  said.  “But   it   must  be
dismantled by toniJht.  ”  She Jestured at a tunnel  branchinJ to  their leIt.
“ThrouJh    there   and   beyond,   that’s   Iood    SrocessinJ  and   stillsuit
maintenance.” She looked at Paul.  “Your  suit looks  new. But  iI  it  needs
work, I’m Jood with  suits. I work in the Iactory in season.”
   They  beJan cominJ on  knots oI  SeoSle now and thicker clusterinJs oI
oSeninJs in  the tunnel’s  sides. A  Iile   oI  men and  women Sassed them
carryinJ Sacks that JurJled heavily, the smell oI sSice stronJ about them.
   “They’ll   not Jet our water,” Harah said. “Or our sSice. You can be sure oI
that.”
   Paul Jlanced at the oSeninJs in the tunnel walls, seeinJ the heavy carSets
on the raised ledJe,  JlimSses oI  rooms with  briJht  Iabrics  on the  walls,
Siled cushions. PeoSle in the oSeninJs Iell silent at their aSSroach, Iollowed
Paul with untamed stares.
   “The  SeoSle Iind it stranJe you bested Jamis,” Harah said. “Likely you’ll
have some SrovinJ to do when we’re settled in a new sietch.”
   “I  don’t like  killinJ,”  he said.
   “Thus  StilJar tells it,”  she said, but her voice betrayed her disbelieI.
   A  shrill  chantinJ Jrew louder ahead oI them. They came to another side
oSeninJ wider than any oI  the others Paul had seen. He slowed his Sace,
starinJ  in  at  a  room  crowded  with  children   sittinJ  cross-leJJed  on  a
maroon-carSeted Iloor.
   At   a  chalkboard  aJainst  the  Iar  wall   stood  a  woman  in   a  yellow
wraSaround, a SroMecto-stylus in one hand.  The  board  was Iilled   with
desiJns—circles, wedJes and curves, snake tracks and sTuares, IlowinJ arcs
sSlit by Sarallel lines. The woman Sointed to the desiJns one aIter the other

388
as Iast as she could move the stylus,  and the children  chanted in rhythm
with her movinJ hand.
   Paul  listened,  hearinJ the  voices  Jrow  dimmer  behind  as he  moved
deeSer into the sietch with Harah.
   “Tree,”   the children  chanted. “Tree, Jrass, dune, wind,  mountain, hill,
Iire, liJhtninJ,  rock, rocks, dust, sand, heat, shelter, heat, Iull, winter, cold,
emSty, erosion,  summer,  cavern,  day,  tension,  moon,  niJht,   caSrock,
sandtide, sloSe, SlantinJ, binder….”
   “You  conduct classes at a time like this?” Paul asked.
   Her  Iace went somber and JrieI edJed her voice: “What  Liet  tauJht us,
we cannot Sause an instant in that. Liet who is dead must not be IorJotten.
It’s the Chakobsa way.”
   She crossed the tunnel to the leIt, steSSed uS onto a ledJe, Sarted Jauzy
oranJe hanJinJs and stood aside: “Your yali is ready Ior you, Usul.”
   Paul hesitated beIore MoininJ her on the ledJe. He Ielt a sudden reluctance
to be alone with this  woman. It  came to him that he was surrounded by a
way oI liIe that could only be understood by SostulatinJ an ecoloJy oI ideas
and values. He Ielt  that this Fremen world  was IishinJ  Ior  him, tryinJ   to
snare him in its ways. And he knew what lay in  that snare—the wild Mihad,
the reliJious war he Ielt he should avoid at any cost.
   “This  is your yali,”  Harah said. “Why do you hesitate?”
   Paul nodded, Moined her on the ledJe. He liIted the hanJinJs across Irom
her, IeelinJ metal Iibers in the Iabric, Iollowed her into a short entrance way
and then into a larJer room, sTuare, about si[ meters to a side—thick blue
carSets on  the  Iloor,   blue   and  Jreen  Iabrics  hidinJ   the   rock  walls,
JlowJlobes tuned to yellow overhead bobbinJ aJainst draSed yellow ceilinJ
Iabrics.
   The eIIect was that oI an ancient tent.
   Harah stood in Iront  oI him, leIt  hand on hiS, her eyes studyinJ his Iace.
“The children  are with  a Iriend,”  she said. “They  will  Sresent themselves
later.”
   Paul  masked his  unease beneath a Tuick scanninJ oI  the  room.  Thin
hanJinJs to the riJht, he saw, Sartly concealed a larJer room with cushions
Siled around the walls. He Ielt a soIt breeze Irom an air duct, saw the outlet
cunninJly hidden in a Sattern oI hanJinJs directly ahead oI him.
   “Do  you wish me to helS you remove your stillsuit?” Harah asked.
   “No…  thank you.”

389
   “Shall  I brinJ Iood?”
   “Yes.”
   “There  is a reclamation chamber oII the other room.” She Jestured. “For
your comIort and convenience when you’re out oI your stillsuit.”
   “You  said  we have  to leave this  sietch,”  Paul said.  “Shouldn’t  we be
SackinJ or somethinJ?”
   “It  will  be done in its time,” she said. “The butchers have yet to Senetrate
to our reJion.”
   Still  she hesitated, starinJ at him.
   “What  is it?” he demanded.
   “You’ve  not the eyes oI the Ibad,” she said. “It’s  stranJe but not entirely
unattractive.”
   “Get  the Iood,” he said. “I’m hunJry.”
   She smiled at him—a knowinJ, woman’s smile that he Iound disTuietinJ.
“I  am  your  servant,”  she said,  and whirled   away in   one lithe  motion,
duckinJ behind a heavy wall hanJinJ  that revealed another SassaJe beIore
IallinJ back into Slace.
   FeelinJ anJry with  himselI, Paul brushed throuJh the thin hanJinJ on the
riJht  and  into  the  larJer   room.  He  stood  there a  moment  cauJht  by
uncertainty. And he wondered where Chani was… Chani who had Must lost
her Iather.
   We’re alike in that, he thouJht.
   A  wailinJ  cry  sounded Irom the outer corridors,  its volume muIIled  by
the interveninJ hanJinJs.  It  was reSeated, a bit more distant. And  aJain.
Paul realized someone was callinJ the time. He Iocused on the Iact that he
had seen no clocks.
   The Iaint  smell oI  burninJ creosote bush came to his nostrils, ridinJ  on
the omniSresent stink oI the sietch. Paul saw that he had already suSSressed
the odorous assault on his senses.
   And  he wondered aJain about his mother, how  the movinJ  montaJe oI
the Iuture  would  incorSorate her…  and the  dauJhter she bore. Mutable
time-awareness danced around him. He shook his head sharSly, IocusinJ his
attention on the evidences that sSoke oI SroIound deSth and breadth in this
Fremen culture that had swallowed them.
   With  its subtle oddities.
   He  had  seen a  thinJ  about  the caverns  and this  room,  a  thinJ  that
suJJested Iar Jreater diIIerences than anythinJ he had yet encountered.

390
   There was no  siJn oI  a Soison snooSer here, no indication oI  their use
anywhere in  the cave  warren. Yet  he could  smell  Soisons in  the sietch
stench—stronJ ones, common ones.
   He heard a rustle oI hanJinJs, thouJht it  was Harah returninJ with Iood,
and turned  to  watch  her. Instead,  Irom  beneath a  disSlaced Sattern oI
hanJinJs, he saw two younJ boys—SerhaSs aJed nine and ten—starinJ out
at him with Jreedy eyes. Each wore a small kindMal-tySe oI cryskniIe, rested
a hand on the hilt.
   And  Paul recalled the stories oI the Fremen—that their children IouJht as
Ierociously as the adults.

391
        The hands move, the lips move—Ideas gush from his words, And his eyes devour! He is an
        island of Selfdom.
                                       —description from “A Manual of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  PHOSPHORTUBES IN  the Iaraway  uSSer reaches oI the cavern  cast a dim
liJht   onto  the   thronJed   interior,   hintinJ   at   the  Jreat  size  oI   this   rock-
enclosed sSace… larJer,   Jessica saw, than  even the  GatherinJ  Hall   oI  her
Bene Gesserit  school.  She  estimated  there  were  more  than  Iive  thousand
SeoSle Jathered out there beneath the ledJe where  she stood with  StilJar.
    And more  were cominJ.
    The air was murmurous  with  SeoSle.
    “Your  son  has been  summoned  Irom  his  rest,  Sayyadina,”   StilJar  said.
“Do  you wish  him to  share in your  decision?”
    “Could  he chanJe my  decision?”
    “Certainly,  the  air with  which  you  sSeak comes Irom your  own  lunJs, but
—”
    “The  decision stands,”  she said.
    But  she Ielt  misJivinJs,   wonderinJ   iI   she should  use Paul  as an e[cuse
Ior  backinJ  out  oI  a  danJerous  course. There  was  an  unborn  dauJhter  to
think  oI  as well.  What  endanJered  the Ilesh  oI  the  mother  endanJered the
Ilesh oI the  dauJhter.
    Men came with  rolled  carSets, JruntinJ  under  the weiJht  oI  them, stirrinJ
uS dust as the loads were droSSed onto the ledJe.
    StilJar  took her  arm, led her  back into  the acoustical  horn that Iormed  the
rear limits   oI  the  ledJe.  He indicated   a rock  bench  within   the  horn.  “The
Reverend Mother  will  sit  here, but you  may rest yourselI  until  she comes.”
    “I  SreIer to stand,”  Jessica said.
    She watched the men  unroll  the carSets, coverinJ  the ledJe,  looked out  at
the crowd. There  were at least ten thousand SeoSle on the rock  Iloor  now.
    And still  they  came.
    Out on  the desert,  she knew, it  already  was red  niJhtIall,   but  here in  the
cavern hall   was  SerSetual twiliJht,    a Jray   vastness thronJed   with  SeoSle
come to see her risk her liIe.

392
   A  way  was oSened throuJh the  crowd to  her riJht,  and  she saw Paul
aSSroachinJ Ilanked by two small boys. There was a swaJJerinJ air oI selI-
imSortance about the children. They keSt hands on knives, scowled at the
wall oI SeoSle on either side.
   “The  sons oI Jamis who are now the sons oI  Usul,”  StilJar said. “They
take their escort duties seriously.” He ventured a smile at Jessica.
   Jessica recoJnized the eIIort to liJhten her mood and was JrateIul Ior it,
but could not take her mind Irom the danJer that conIronted her.
   I  had no choice but to do this, she thouJht. We must move swiftly if we’re
to secure our place among these Fremen.
   Paul climbed to the ledJe, leavinJ the children below. He stoSSed in Iront
oI his  mother, Jlanced at StilJar,  back to  Jessica. “What is  haSSeninJ? I
thouJht I was beinJ summoned to council.”
   StilJar  raised a hand Ior silence, Jestured to his leIt  where another way
had been oSened in the thronJ. Chani came down the lane oSened there, her
elIin  Iace set in  lines oI  JrieI.  She had removed her stillsuit  and wore  a
JraceIul blue wraSaround that e[Sosed her thin arms. Near the shoulder on
her leIt arm, a Jreen kerchieI had been tied.
   Green for mourning, Paul thouJht.
   It  was one oI the customs the two sons oI Jamis had e[Slained to him by
indirection, tellinJ  him  they wore  no Jreen because they acceSted him as
Juardian-Iather.
   “Are  you  the Lisan al-Gaib?”  they had asked. And Paul had sensed the
Mihad in their words,  shruJJed oII   the Tuestion with   one oI  his  own—
learninJ then that KaleII, the elder oI the two,  was ten, and the natural son
oI GeoII. OrloS, the younJer, was eiJht, the natural son oI Jamis.
   It  had been a stranJe day with these two standinJ Juard over him because
he asked it, keeSinJ away the curious, allowinJ  him the  time to nurse his
thouJhts and Srescient memories, to Slan a way to Srevent the Mihad.
   Now,  standinJ beside his mother on the cavern ledJe and lookinJ out at
the thronJ, he wondered iI  any Slan could Srevent the wild  outSourinJ oI
Ianatic leJions.
   Chani,  nearinJ the  ledJe, was  Iollowed  at  a distance by  Iour  women
carryinJ another woman in a litter.
   Jessica iJnored   Chani’s  aSSroach, IocusinJ all   her  attention  on  the
woman in the litter—a  crone, a  wrinkled and shriveled  ancient thinJ in  a

393
black Jown with hood thrown back to reveal the tiJht knot oI  Jray hair and
the strinJy neck.
   The litter-carriers deSosited their burden Jently on the ledJe Irom below,
and Chani helSed the old woman to her Ieet.
   So this is their Reverend Mother, Jessica thouJht.
   The old  woman leaned heavily on Chani as she hobbled toward Jessica,
lookinJ like  a collection oI  sticks draSed in the black robe. She stoSSed in
Iront oI  Jessica, Seered uSward Ior a lonJ  moment beIore sSeakinJ in  a
husky whisSer.
   “So  you’re the one.” The old  head nodded once Srecariously on the thin
neck. “The Shadout MaSes was riJht to Sity you.”
   Jessica sSoke Tuickly, scornIully: “I need no one’s Sity.”
   “That   remains to  be seen,”  husked the  old  woman.  She turned with
surSrisinJ Tuickness and Iaced the thronJ. “Tell them, StilJar.”
   “Must  I?” he asked.
   “We  are the SeoSle oI Misr,”  the  old woman rasSed. “Since our  Sunni
ancestors Iled Irom Nilotic   al-Ourouba, we have known  IliJht  and death.
The younJ Jo on that our SeoSle shall not die.”
   StilJar  took a deeS breath, steSSed Iorward two Saces.
   Jessica Ielt   the  hush  come over  the  crowded  cavern—some twenty
thousand SeoSle now, standinJ silently, almost without movement. It made
her Ieel suddenly small and Iilled with caution.
   “ToniJht  we must leave this  sietch that has sheltered us Ior so lonJ and
Jo south into  the  desert,” StilJar  said. His  voice  boomed out across the
uSliIted Iaces, reverberatinJ with the Iorce  Jiven it  by the acoustical horn
behind the ledJe.
   Still  the thronJ remained silent.
   “The  Reverend Mother tells me she cannot survive another haMra,” StilJar
said. “We have lived beIore without  a Reverend Mother, but it is not Jood
Ior SeoSle to seek a new home in such straits.”
   Now, the thronJ stirred, riSSlinJ with whisSers and currents oI disTuiet.
   “That   this may  not  come to  Sass,” StilJar  said,  “our  new  Sayyadina
Jessica oI the WeirdinJ, has consented to enter the rite at this time. She will
attemSt to  Sass within  that  we  not  lose  the  strenJth oI   our  Reverend
Mother.”
   Jessica of the Weirding, Jessica thouJht. She saw Paul starinJ at her, his
eyes Iilled with  Tuestions, but his mouth held silent by  all the stranJeness

394
around them.
   If  I  die in  the attempt, what will  become of him?  Jessica asked herselI.
AJain she Ielt the misJivinJs Iill  her mind.
   Chani led the old Reverend Mother to a rock bench deeS in the acoustical
horn, returned to stand beside StilJar.
   “That  we may not lose all iI  Jessica oI the WeirdinJ should Iail,”  StilJar
said, “Chani, dauJhter oI Liet,  will  be consecrated in the Sayyadina at this
time.” He steSSed one Sace to the side.
   From  deeS in the acoustical horn,  the old  woman’s voice  came out to
them, an amSliIied  whisSer, harsh and  SenetratinJ: “Chani  has returned
Irom her haMra—Chani has seen the waters.”
   A  sussurant resSonse arose Irom the crowd: “She has seen the waters.”
   “I   consecrate the dauJhter oI  Liet  in  the  Sayyadina,”  husked the old
woman.
   “She is acceSted,” the crowd resSonded.
   Paul barely heard the ceremony, his attention still  centered on what had
been said oI his mother.
   If  she should fail?
   He  turned  and looked  back at  the one  they called  Reverend Mother,
studyinJ the dried crone Ieatures, the Iathomless blue Ii[ation  oI her eyes.
She looked as thouJh a  breeze would blow  her away, yet  there was that
about her which   suJJested she miJht  stand untouched in  the  Sath oI  a
coriolis storm. She carried the same aura oI Sower that he remembered Irom
the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam who had tested him with aJony
in the way oI the Jom Mabbar.
   “I,  the Reverend Mother Ramallo, whose voice sSeaks as a multitude, say
this  to  you,”   the  old  woman  said.  “It   is  IittinJ   that  Chani  enter  the
Sayyadina.”
   “It  is IittinJ,”   the crowd resSonded.
   The  old  woman  nodded, whisSered: “I   Jive  her the  silver  skies,  the
Jolden desert and its shininJ rocks, the Jreen Iields that will be. I Jive these
to Sayyadina Chani. And lest she IorJet that she’s servant oI us all, to  her
Iall the menial tasks in this  Ceremony oI the Seed. Let it be as Shai-hulud
will have it.”  She liIted a brown-stick arm, droSSed it.
   Jessica, IeelinJ the ceremony close around her with a current that sweSt
her beyond all  turninJ  back, Jlanced  once at Paul’s  Tuestion-Iilled Iace,
then SreSared herselI Ior the ordeal.

395
   “Let  the watermasters come Iorward,” Chani said with only  the sliJhtest
Tuaver oI uncertainty in her Jirl-child voice.
   Now,  Jessica Ielt herselI at the Iocus oI danJer, knowinJ its Sresence in
the watchIulness oI the thronJ, in the silence.
   A  band oI  men made its  way throuJh  a serSentine Sath oSened in the
crowd, movinJ  uS Irom  the back in  Sairs. Each Sair carried a small skin
sack, SerhaSs twice the size oI a human head. The sacks sloshed heavily.
   The  two  leaders deSosited their load at Chani’s  Ieet on  the ledJe  and
steSSed back.
   Jessica looked at the sack, then at the men. They had their hoods thrown
back, e[SosinJ lonJ hair tied in a roll at the base oI the neck. The black Sits
oI their eyes stared back at her without waverinJ.
   A   Iurry   redolence oI  cinnamon  arose Irom   the  sack, waIted  across
Jessica. The spice? she wondered.
   “Is  there water?” Chani asked.
   The  watermaster on the leIt,  a  man with  a SurSle scar line  across the
bridJe oI his nose, nodded once. “There is water, Sayyadina,” he said, “but
we cannot drink oI it.”
   “Is  there seed?” Chani asked.
   “There is seed,” the man said.
   Chani knelt and Sut her hands to the sloshinJ sack. “Blessed is the water
and its seed.”
   There was Iamiliarity  to the rite, and Jessica looked back at the Reverend
Mother Ramallo. The old  woman’s eyes were closed and she sat hunched
over as thouJh asleeS.
   “Sayyadina Jessica,” Chani said.
   Jessica turned to see the Jirl starinJ uS at her.
   “Have  you tasted the blessed water?” Chani asked.
   BeIore Jessica could answer, Chani said: “It is not Sossible that you have
tasted the blessed water. You are outworlder and unSrivileJed.”
   A  siJh  Sassed throuJh the crowd, a sussuration oI robes that made the
naSe hairs creeS on Jessica’s neck.
   “The  croS was larJe and the maker has been destroyed,” Chani said. She
beJan unIasteninJ a coiled sSout Ii[ed to the toS oI the sloshinJ sack.
   Now,  Jessica Ielt the sense oI danJer boilinJ around her. She Jlanced at
Paul, saw that he was cauJht uS in the mystery oI  the ritual and had eyes
only Ior Chani.

396
   Has he seen this moment in time? Jessica wondered. She rested a hand on
her abdomen, thinkinJ oI  the unborn dauJhter there, askinJ  herselI: Do I
have the right to risk us both?
   Chani liIted  the sSout toward Jessica, said: “Here is the Water oI LiIe, the
water that is Jreater than water—Kan, the water that Irees the soul. II  you
be a Reverend Mother, it oSens the universe to you. Let Shai-hulud MudJe
now.”
   Jessica Ielt  herselI torn  between duty to  her unborn child  and  duty to
Paul. For Paul, she knew, she should take that sSout and drink oI the sack’s
contents, but as she bent to the SroIIered sSout, her senses told her its Seril.
   The stuII  in the sack had a bitter smell subtly akin  to many Soisons that
she knew, but unlike them, too.
   “You  must drink it now,” Chani said.
   There’s no turning back, Jessica reminded herselI. But nothinJ in all her
Bene Gesserit traininJ came into her mind to helS her throuJh this instant.
   What is it? Jessica asked herselI. LiTuor? A drug?
   She bent over the sSout, smelled the esthers oI cinnamon, rememberinJ
then the drunkenness oI Duncan Idaho. Spice liTuor? she asked herselI. She
took the siShon tube in her mouth, Sulled uS only the most minuscule siS. It
tasted oI the sSice, a Iaint bite acrid on the tonJue.
   Chani Sressed down on the skin baJ. A Jreat JulS oI the stuII surJed into
Jessica’s mouth  and beIore  she  could  helS  herselI,  she swallowed  it,
IiJhtinJ to retain her calmness and diJnity.
   “To  acceSt a little death is worse than death itselI,” Chani said. She stared
at Jessica, waitinJ.
   And  Jessica stared back, still holdinJ the sSout in her mouth. She tasted
the sack’s contents in her nostrils, in the rooI oI her mouth, in her cheeks, in
her eyes—a bitinJ sweetness, now.
   Cool.
   AJain,  Chani sent the liTuid JushinJ into Jessica’s mouth.
   Delicate.
   Jessica studied Chani’s Iace—elIin  Ieatures—seeinJ the traces oI Liet-
Kynes there as yet unIi[ed by time.
   This is a drug they feed me, Jessica told herselI.
   But  it  was unlike  any other druJ  oI her  e[Serience, and Bene Gesserit
traininJ included the taste oI many druJs.
   Chani’s Ieatures were so clear, as thouJh outlined in liJht.

397
   A drug.
   WhirlinJ   silence settled around Jessica. Every Iiber oI her body acceSted
the Iact that somethinJ SroIound had haSSened to it. She Ielt that she was a
conscious mote, smaller than any subatomic Sarticle, yet caSable oI motion
and oI sensinJ her  surroundinJs. Like  an abruSt revelation—the curtains
whiSSed away—she realized she had become aware oI a Ssychokinesthetic
e[tension oI herselI. She was the mote, yet not the mote.
   The  cavern remained around her—the  SeoSle. She sensed them: Paul,
Chani, StilJar, the Reverend Mother Ramallo.
   Reverend Mother!
   At   the  school there  had been rumors  that  some did  not  survive  the
Reverend Mother ordeal, that the druJ took them.
   Jessica Iocused her attention on  the Reverend Mother  Ramallo, aware
now that all this was haSSeninJ in a Irozen instant oI time—susSended time
Ior her alone.
   Why  is  time  suspended? she asked herselI. She  stared at  the Irozen
e[Sressions around her, seeinJ a dust mote  above Chani’s head, stoSSed
there.
   WaitinJ.
   The answer to this instant came like an e[Slosion  in her consciousness :
her Sersonal time was susSended to save her liIe.
   She  Iocused  on  the  Ssychokinesthetic e[tension   oI  herselI,  lookinJ
within,  and  was conIronted  immediately  with   a  cellular  core, a  Sit  oI
blackness Irom which she recoiled.
   That  is the place where we cannot look, she thouJht. There is the place
the Reverend Mothers are so reluctant to mention—the place where only a
Kwisatz Haderach may look.
   This  realization returned a small  measure oI conIidence, and aJain she
ventured to Iocus on the Ssychokinesthetic e[tension, becominJ a mote-selI
that searched within her Ior danJer.
   She Iound it within  the druJ she had swallowed.
   The stuII  was dancinJ Sarticles within her, its motions so raSid that even
Irozen time could not stoS them. DancinJ Sarticles. She beJan recoJnizinJ
Iamiliar structures, atomic linkaJes: a carbon atom here, helical waverinJ…
a Jlucose molecule. An entire chain  oI molecules conIronted her, and she
recoJnized a Srotein… a methyl-Srotein conIiJuration.
   Ah-h-h!

398
   It  was a soundless mental siJh within  her  as she saw the nature oI the
Soison.
   With  her Ssychokinesthetic SrobinJ, she moved into it, shiIted an o[yJen
mote,  allowed  another  carbon  mote  to   link,   reattached a  linkaJe   oI
o[yJen… hydroJen.
   The chanJe sSread… Iaster and Iaster as the catalyzed reaction oSened its
surIace oI contact.
   The susSension oI time rela[ed its hold uSon her, and she sensed motion.
The tube sSout Irom the sack was touched to her mouth-Jently, collectinJ a
droS oI moisture.
   Chani’s  taking the catalyst  from my  body to change the poison  in that
sack, Jessica thouJht. Why?
   Someone eased her  to  a sittinJ   Sosition.  She saw the  old  Reverend
Mother Ramallo beinJ  brouJht to  sit beside her on the  carSeted ledJe. A
dry hand touched her neck.
   And  there  was another Ssychokinesthetic mote  within  her  awareness!
Jessica tried to reMect it, but the mote sweSt closer… closer.
   They touched!
   It  was like an ultimate simpatico, beinJ two SeoSle at once: not teleSathy,
but mutual awareness.
   With the old Reverend Mother!
   But  Jessica saw that the Reverend Mother didn’t think oI herselI as old.
An  imaJe unIolded  beIore  the mutual  mind’s  eye: a  younJ  Jirl   with  a
dancinJ sSirit and tender humor.
   Within   the mutual awareness, the younJ Jirl   said, “Yes, that  is how  I
am.”
   Jessica could only acceSt the words, not resSond to them.
   “You’ll   have it all soon, Jessica,” the inward imaJe said.
   This is hallucination,  Jessica told herselI.
   “You  know better than that,” the inward imaJe said. “SwiItly now, do not
IiJht  me. There isn’t  much time. We….”  There came a lonJ  Sause, then:
“You should’ve told us you were SreJnant!”
   Jessica Iound the voice that talked within the mutual awareness. “Why?”
   “This  chanJes both oI you! Holy Mother, what have we done?”
   Jessica sensed a Iorced shiIt in the mutual awareness, saw another mote-
Sresence with the inward  eye. The other  mote darted wildly   here, there,
circlinJ. It  radiated Sure terror.

399
   “You’ll   have to  be stronJ,”  the old  Reverend Mother’s imaJe-Sresence
said. “Be thankIul  it’s  a dauJhter you  carry. This would’ve  killed  a  male
Ietus. Now…  careIully,  Jently…  touch  your dauJhter-Sresence. Be your
dauJhter-Sresence. Absorb the Iear… soothe… use your couraJe and your
strenJth… Jently now… Jently….”
   The  other whirlinJ   mote sweSt near, and Jessica comSelled herselI to
touch it.
   Terror threatened to overwhelm her.
   She IouJht it  the only way  she knew: “I  shall not fear. Fear is the mind
killer…. ”
   The  litany  brouJht a semblance oI calm.  The other mote lay  Tuiescent
aJainst her.
   Words won’t work, Jessica told herselI.
   She reduced herselI to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comIort,
a warm snuJJlinJ oI Srotection.
   The terror receded.
   AJain,  the Sresence oI the old Reverend Mother asserted itselI, but now
there was a  triSlinJ  oI  mutual  awareness—two active  and one  that lay
Tuietly absorbinJ.
   “Time  comSels me,” the Reverend Mother said within the awareness. “I
have much to Jive you. And I  do not know iI  your  dauJhter can acceSt all
this  while  remaininJ  sane. But  it   must  be: the  needs oI   the tribe  are
Saramount.”
   “What—”
   “Remain silent and acceSt!”
   E[Seriences beJan to unroll beIore Jessica. It was like a lecture striS in a
subliminal  traininJ  SroMector at the Bene Gesserit school… but  Iaster…
blindinJly  Iaster.
   Yet… distinct.
   She  knew each e[Serience  as it  haSSened: there was a lover—virile,
bearded, with the Fremen eyes, and Jessica saw his strenJth and tenderness,
all oI him in one blink-moment, throuJh the Reverend Mother’s memory.
   There  was no  time  now to  think  oI  what  this  miJht  be doinJ  to  the
dauJhter Ietus, only time to  acceSt and record. The e[Seriences Soured in
on  Jessica—birth,  liIe,   death—imSortant matters  and  unimSortant,  an
outSourinJ oI sinJle-view time.

400
   Why should a fall  of sand from a clifftop stick in  the memory? she asked
herselI.
   Too late, Jessica saw what was haSSeninJ: the old woman was dyinJ and,
in  dyinJ,  SourinJ  her  e[Seriences into  Jessica’s awareness as water is
Soured into a cuS. The other mote Iaded back into Sre-birth  awareness as
Jessica watched it. And, dyinJ-in-conceStion, the old Reverend Mother leIt
her liIe in Jessica’s memory with one last siJhinJ blur oI words.
   “I’ve  been a lonJ time waitinJ Ior you,”  she said. “Here is my liIe.”
   There it was, encaSsuled, all oI it.
   Even the moment oI death.
   I  am now a Reverend Mother, Jessica realized.
   And  she knew  with  a  Jeneralized awareness that she had become, in
truth, Srecisely what was meant by a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. The
Soison druJ had transIormed her.
   This  wasn’t  e[actly  how  they  did  it  at the  Bene Gesserit school, she
knew. No one had ever introduced her to the mysteries oI it, but she knew.
   The end result was the same.
   Jessica sensed the  dauJhter-mote still   touchinJ  her  inner  awareness,
Srobed it without resSonse.
   A  terrible  sense oI loneliness creSt throuJh Jessica in the realization oI
what had haSSened to her. She saw her own liIe as a Sattern that had slowed
and all  liIe  around her sSeeded uS so that the dancinJ  interSlay became
clearer.
   The sensation oI mote-awareness Iaded sliJhtly, its intensity easinJ as her
body rela[ed Irom the threat oI the Soison, but still she Ielt that other mote,
touchinJ it with a sense oI Juilt at what she had allowed to haSSen to it.
   I  did it,  my poor, unformed, dear little  daughter, I brought  you into this
universe and  exposed your  awareness to   all  its  varieties   without  any
defenses.
   A   tiny  outIlowinJ   oI  love-comIort,  like  a reIlection  oI  what  she had
Soured into it, came Irom the other mote.
   BeIore  Jessica could resSond, she Ielt the adab Sresence oI demandinJ
memory. There  was  somethinJ  that  needed doinJ.   She JroSed  Ior  it,
realizinJ  she was  beinJ  imSeded by  a muzziness oI   the chanJed  druJ
SermeatinJ her senses.
   I  could change that, she thouJht. I could take away the drug action  and
make it harmless. But she sensed this would be an error. I’m within a rite of

401
joining.
   Then she knew what she had to do.
   Jessica oSened her eyes, Jestured to the watersack now beinJ held above
her by Chani.
   “It   has been blessed,” Jessica said. “MinJle  the waters, let  the chanJe
come to all, that the SeoSle may Sartake and share in the blessinJ.”
   Let  the catalyst do its work,  she thought. Let the people drink  of it  and
have their awareness of each other heightened for awhile. The drug is safe
now… now that a Reverend Mother has changed it.
   Still,   the  demandinJ  memory  worked   on  her,  thrustinJ.  There  was
another thinJ she had to do, she realized, but the druJ made it  diIIicult  to
Iocus.
   Ah-h-h-h-h … the old Reverend Mother.
   “I  have met the Reverend Mother Ramallo,”  Jessica said. “She is Jone,
but she remains. Let her memory be honored in the rite.”
   Now, where did I get those words? Jessica wondered.
   And  she realized they came Irom another memory, the life that had been
Jiven to  her and now  was Sart oI  herselI. SomethinJ  about that JiIt  Ielt
incomSlete, thouJh.
   “Let  them have their orgy, ”  the other-memory said within her. “They’ve
little enouJh Sleasure out oI livinJ.  Yes, and you and I need this little time
to become acTuainted beIore I recede and Sour out throuJh your memories.
Already, I Ieel myselI beinJ tied to bits oI you. Ah-h-h, you’ve a mind Iilled
with interestinJ thinJs. So many thinJs I’d never imaJined.”
   And  the memory-mind encaSsulated within her oSened itselI to Jessica,
SermittinJ a view  down  a wide corridor  to  other Reverend Mothers until
there seemed no end to them.
   Jessica recoiled, IearinJ she would become lost in an ocean oI oneness.
Still, the corridor remained, revealinJ to Jessica that the Fremen culture was
Iar older than she had susSected.
   There had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a SeoSle Jrown soIt with an
easy Slanet, Iair  Jame Ior   ImSerial raiders  to  harvest and Slant  human
colonies on Bela TeJeuse and Salusa Secundus.
   Oh, the wailinJ  Jessica sensed in that SartinJ.
   Far  down the  corridor, an imaJe-voice  screamed: “They denied us the
HaMM!”

402
   Jessica saw the slave cribs on Bela TeJeuse down that inner corridor, saw
the  weedinJ  out   and  the  selectinJ   that  sSread men   to  Rossak  and
HarmontheS. Scenes oI brutal Ierocity  oSened to her like  the Setals oI  a
terrible Ilower.  And  she saw the thread oI  the Sast carried by  Sayyadina
aIter Sayyadina—Iirst by word oI mouth, hidden in the sand chanteys, then
reIined throuJh  their  own  Reverend Mothers  with  the  discovery oI   the
Soison druJ on Rossak … and now develoSed to subtle strenJth on Arrakis
in the discovery oI the Water oI LiIe.
   Far down the inner  corridor, another voice screamed: “Never to IorJive!
Never to IorJet!”
   But  Jessica’s attention was Iocused on the revelation oI the Water oI LiIe,
seeinJ its source: the liTuid e[halation oI a dyinJ sandworm, a maker. And
as she saw the killinJ oI it in her new memory, she suSSressed a JasS.
   The creature was drowned!
   “Mother,  are you all riJht?”
   Paul’s  voice  intruded  on  her, and  Jessica struJJled  out oI   the inner
awareness to stare uS at him, conscious oI duty to  him, but  resentinJ his
Sresence.
   I’m  like  a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from
the first  moment of awareness—until one day the ability  to  feel is  forced
into them.
   The thouJht hunJ in her mind, an enclosinJ awareness.
   And I  say: “Look!  I  have no hands!”  But the people all around me say:
“What are hands?”
   “Are  you all riJht?”  Paul reSeated.
   “Yes.”
   “Is  this  all  riJht  Ior  me to  drink?”  He Jestured to  the sack in  Chani’s
hands. “They want me to drink it.”
   She heard the hidden meaninJ in his words, realized he had detected the
Soison in the oriJinal, unchanJed substance, that he was concerned Ior her.
It occurred to Jessica then to wonder about the limits oI Paul’s Srescience.
His Tuestion revealed much to her.
   “You  may  drink  it,”  she said. “It   has been chanJed.” And  she looked
beyond him to see StilJar starinJ down at her, the dark-dark eyes studyinJ.
   “Now,  we know you cannot be Ialse,” he said.
   She sensed hidden meaninJ here, too, but the muzziness oI the druJ was
overSowerinJ her senses. How warm it was and soothinJ. How beneIicent

403
these Fremen to brinJ her into the Iold oI such comSanionshiS.
   Paul saw the druJ take hold oI his mother.
   He  searched his memory—the Ii[ed  Sast, the Ilu[-lines   oI the Sossible
Iutures. It was like scanninJ throuJh arrested instants oI time, disconcertinJ
to the  lens oI  the inner  eye. The  IraJments were diIIicult   to  understand
when snatched out oI the Ilu[.
   This  druJ—he  could assemble knowledJe about it,  understand what it
was doinJ to his mother, but the knowledJe lacked a natural rhythm, lacked
a system oI mutual reIlection.
   He realized suddenly that it  was one thinJ to see the Sast occuSyinJ the
Sresent, but the true test oI Srescience was to see the Sast in the Iuture.
   ThinJs Sersisted in not beinJ what they seemed.
   “Drink  it,”  Chani said. She waved the hornsSout oI a watersack under his
nose.
   Paul straiJhtened, starinJ at Chani. He Ielt carnival e[citement in the air.
He  knew  what   would   haSSen iI   he  drank  this   sSice druJ   with   its
Tuintessence oI the substance that brouJht the chanJe onto him. He would
return to the vision oI Sure time, oI time-become-sSace. It would Serch him
on the dizzyinJ summit and deIy him to understand.
   From behind Chani, StilJar said: “Drink  it, lad. You delay the rite.”
   Paul  listened to  the  crowd  then, hearinJ  the wildness  in  their  voices
—“Lisan al-Gaib,”  they said. “Muad’Dib!”   He looked  down at his mother.
She aSSeared SeaceIully asleeS in a sittinJ Sosition—her breathinJ even
and deeS. A Shrase out oI the Iuture that was his lonely Sast came into his
mind: “She sleeps in the Waters of Life. ”
   Chani tuJJed at his sleeve.
   Paul took the hornsSout into his mouth, hearinJ the SeoSle shout. He Ielt
the liTuid Jush into his throat as Chani Sressed the sack, sensed Jiddiness in
the Iumes.  Chani  removed the  sSout, handed the  sack  into  hands that
reached Ior it Irom the Iloor oI the cavern. His eyes Iocused on her arm, the
Jreen band oI mourninJ there.
   As  she straiJhtened, Chani saw  the direction  oI his  Jaze, said: “I   can
mourn him even in the haSSiness oI the waters. This was somethinJ he Jave
us.” She Sut her hand into his, SullinJ him alonJ the ledJe. “We are alike in
a thinJ, Usul: We have each lost a Iather to the Harkonnens.”
   Paul Iollowed  her. He Ielt that his head had been seSarated Irom his body
and restored with odd connections. His leJs were remote and rubbery.

404
   They entered a narrow side SassaJe, its walls dimly liJhted by sSaced-out
JlowJlobes. Paul Ielt  the druJ beJinninJ  to have its uniTue eIIect on him,
oSeninJ time like a Ilower. He  Iound need to steady himselI aJainst Chani
as they turned throuJh another shadowed tunnel. The mi[ture oI whiScord
and soItness he  Ielt  beneath her  robe  stirred  his  blood.  The  sensation
minJled with the work  oI the druJ, IoldinJ  Iuture and Sast into the Sresent,
leavinJ him the thinnest marJin oI trinocular Iocus.
   “I  know  you, Chani,”  he whisSered. “We’ve sat uSon a ledJe above the
sand while I  soothed your Iears. We’ve caressed in the dark oI the sietch.
We’ve….” He Iound himselI losinJ Iocus, tried to shake his head, stumbled.
   Chani  steadied him,  led  him  throuJh  thick  hanJinJs  into  the  yellow
warmth  oI  a  Srivate  aSartment—low  tables, cushions,  a  sleeSinJ  Sad
beneath an oranJe sSread.
   Paul Jrew aware that they had stoSSed, that Chani stood IacinJ him, and
that her eyes betrayed a look oI Tuiet terror.
   “You  must tell me,” she whisSered.
   “You  are Sihaya,” he said, “the desert sSrinJ.”
   “When  the tribe shares the Water,” she said, “we’re toJether—ail  oI us.
We … share. I can… sense the others with me, but I’m aIraid to share with
you.”
   “Why?”
   He  tried  to  Iocus  on her,  but  Sast and Iuture  were merJinJ  into   the
Sresent, blurrinJ her imaJe. He saw her in countless ways and Sositions and
settinJs.
   “There’s somethinJ IriJhteninJ  in you,” she said. “When I took you away
Irom  the others… I  did  it  because I could  Ieel  what the  others wanted.
You… Sress on SeoSle. You… make us see thinJs!”
   He Iorced himselI to sSeak distinctly: “What do you see?”
   She looked down at her hands. “I see a child… in my arms. It’s our child,
yours and mine.”  She Sut a hand to  her mouth. “How  can  I know  every
Ieature oI you?”
   They’ve  a little   of the  talent,  his mind  told  him.  But  they suppress it
because it terrifies.
   In  a moment oI clarity, he saw how Chani was tremblinJ.
   “What  is it you want to say?” he asked.
   “Usul,”  she whisSered, and still she trembled.
   “You  cannot back into the Iuture,” he said.

405
   A  SroIound comSassion Ior her sweSt throuJh him. He Sulled her aJainst
him, stroked her head. “Chani, Chani, don’t Iear.”
   “Usul,  helS me,” she cried.
   As  she sSoke, he Ielt  the  druJ comSlete its  work  within  him,  riSSinJ
away the curtains to let him see the distant Jray turmoil oI his Iuture.
   “You’re  so Tuiet,” Chani said.
   He  held himselI  Soised in the awareness, seeinJ time stretch out in  its
weird dimension, delicately balanced yet whirlinJ, narrow yet sSread like a
net JatherinJ countless worlds and Iorces, a tiJhtwire that he must walk, yet
a teeter-totter on which he balanced.
   On one side he could see the ImSerium, a Harkonnen called Feyd-Rautha
who Ilashed toward him like  a deadly blade, the Sardaukar raJinJ oII their
Slanet to sSread SoJrom on Arrakis, the Guild connivinJ  and SlottinJ, the
Bene Gesserit with their scheme oI selective breedinJ. They lay massed like
a thunderhead on his horizon, held back by no more than the Fremen and
their Muad’Dib,   the sleeSinJ Jiant  Fremen Soised Ior their  wild  crusade
across the universe.
   Paul  Ielt  himselI  at the center, at  the Sivot  where the whole  structure
turned, walkinJ a thin wire  oI Seace with a measure oI haSSiness, Chani at
his side. He could see it stretchinJ ahead oI him, a time oI relative Tuiet in a
hidden sietch, a moment oI Seace between Seriods oI violence.
   “There’s no other Slace Ior Seace,” he said.
   “Usul,  you’re cryinJ,”  Chani murmured. “Usul, my  strenJth, do you Jive
moisture to the dead? To whose dead?”
   “To  ones not yet dead,” he said.
   “Then  let them have their time oI liIe,” she said.
   He sensed throuJh the druJ IoJ how riJht she was, Sulled her aJainst him
with savaJe Sressure. “Sihaya!” he said.
   She Sut a Salm aJainst his cheek, “I’m   no lonJer aIraid,  Usul. Look  at
me. I see what you see when you hold me thus.”
   “What  do you see?” he demanded.
   “I  see us JivinJ love to each other in a time oI Tuiet between storms. It’s
what we were meant to do.”
   The druJ  had him aJain and he thouJht: So many times you’ve given me
comfort and forgetfulness. He Ielt anew the hySerillumination with its hiJh-
relieI imaJery  oI  time, sensed his Iuture becominJ memories—the tender

406
indiJnities  oI  Shysical love,  the  sharinJ  and communion  oI  selves, the
soItness and the violence.
   “You’re  the stronJ one, Chani,” he muttered. “Stay with me.”
   “Always,”   she said, and kissed his cheek.

THE PROPHET

408
        No woman, no man, no child ever was deeply intimate with my father. The closest anyone ever
        came to casual cameraderie with the Padishah Emperor was the relationship offered by Count
        Hasimir Fenring, a companion from childhood. The measure of Count Fenring’s friendship
        may be seen first in a positive thing: he allayed the Landraad’s suspicions after the Arrakis
        Affair. It cost more than a billion solaris in spice bribes, so my mother said, and there were
        other gifts as well: slave women, royal honors, and tokens of rank. The second major evidence
        of the Count’s friendship was negative. He refused to kill a man even though it was within his
        capabilities and my father commanded it. I will relate this presently.
                                                               —“Count FenrinJ: A Profile” by the Princess Irulan



 
  THE  BARON     Vladimir      Harkonnen     raJed   down    the   corridor     Irom    his
Srivate   aSartments,   IlittinJ    throuJh    Satches  oI   late  aIternoon    sunliJht    that
Soured  down  Irom   hiJh   windows.    He  bobbed  and  twisted   in  his  susSensors
with  violent   movements.
    Past   the  Srivate    kitchen    he   stormed—Sast    the   library,    Sast   the  small
receStion   room    and   into    the   servants’    antechamber    where    the   eveninJ
rela[ation    already  had  set in.
    The  Juard   caStain,  Iakin   NeIud,   sTuatted   on  a divan   across  the  chamber,
the  stuSor  oI   semuta  dullness   in   his  Ilat   Iace,  the   eerie  wailinJ    oI   semuta
music  around  him.   His  own  court   sat near  to do  his  biddinJ.
    “NeIud!”     the Baron   roared.
    Men  scrambled.
    NeIud   stood,   his  Iace   comSosed   by  the  narcotic    but  with   an  overlay    oI
Saleness that  told  oI  his  Iear.  The  semuta  music  had  stoSSed.
    “My    Lord   Baron,”    NeIud   said.  Only    the  druJ   keSt  the  tremblinJ    out   oI
his voice.
    The  Baron  scanned  the  Iaces  around  him,   seeinJ  the  looks  oI  Irantic   Tuiet
in them.   He returned   his  attention   to NeIud,   and  sSoke  in a silken   tone:
    “How   lonJ   have  you  been my   Juard  caStain,  NeIud?”
    NeIud   swallowed.    “Since   Arrakis,   my  Lord.   Almost   two   years.”
    “And   have  you  always   anticiSated   danJers  to  my  Serson?”
    “Such   has been  my  only  desire,  my  Lord.”
    “Then   where  is  Feyd-Rautha?”    the  Baron  roared.
    NeIud   recoiled.   “M’Lord?”
    “You   do  not   consider   Feyd-Rautha    a  danJer  to  my   Serson?”   AJain,    the
voice  was  silken.

409
   NeIud  wet his liSs with  his tonJue. Some oI the semuta dullness leIt his
eyes. “Feyd-Rautha’s in the slave Tuarters, my Lord.”
   “With   the  women aJain,  eh?” The  Baron trembled  with  the  eIIort  oI
suSSressinJ anJer.
   “Sire,  it could be he’s—”
   “Silence!”
   The  Baron advanced another steS into the antechamber, notinJ how the
men moved  back,  clearinJ   a  subtle  sSace around NeIud,  dissociatinJ
themselves Irom the obMect oI wrath.
   “Did  I not command you to know Srecisely where the na-Baron was at all
times?” the Baron asked. He moved a steS closer. “Did I not say to you that
you were to know precisely what the na-Baron was sayinJ at all times—and
to whom?”  Another steS. “Did  I  not say to  you that  you were to  tell  me
whenever he went into the Tuarters oI the slave women?”
   NeIud swallowed. PersSiration stood out on his Iorehead.
   The Baron held his voice Ilat,  almost devoid oI emShasis: “Did I not say
these thinJs to you?”
   NeIud nodded.
   “And  did I not say to that you were to check all slave boys sent to me and
that you were to do this yourselI… personally?”
   AJain,  NeIud nodded.
   “Did  you, Serchance, not see the blemish on the thiJh oI the one sent me
this eveninJ?” the Baron asked. “Is it Sossible you—”
   “Uncle.”
   The Baron  whirled, stared at Feyd-Rautha standinJ in the doorway. The
Sresence oI his neShew here, now—the look oI hurry that the younJ  man
could not Tuite conceal—all revealed much. Feyd-Rautha had his own sSy
system Iocused on the Baron.
   “There  is a body in  my chambers that I wish removed,” the Baron  said,
and he keSt his hand at the SroMectile weaSon beneath his robes, thankIul
that his shield was the best.
   Feyd-Rautha Jlanced at two  Juardsmen aJainst the riJht  wall,  nodded.
The two  detached themselves, scurried out  the door  and  down the  hall
toward the Baron’s aSartments.
   Those two, eh? the Baron thouJht.  Ah, this young monster has much to
learn yet about conspiracy!

410
   “I   Sresume you leIt  matters SeaceIul in the  slave Tuarters, Feyd,” the
Baron said.
   “I’ve   been SlayinJ cheoSs with the slavemaster,” Feyd-Rautha said, and
he thouJht:  What  has gone  wrong?  The boy  we sent  to  my uncle  has
obviously been killed. But he was perfect for the job. Even Hawat couldn’t
have made a better choice. The boy was perfect!
   “PlayinJ  Syramid chess,” the Baron said. “How nice. Did you win?”
   “I  … ah, yes, Uncle.” And Feyd-Rautha strove to contain his disTuiet.
   The  Baron snaSSed his IinJers. “NeIud, you wish  to be restored to  my
Jood Jraces?”
   “Sire,  what have I done?” NeIud Tuavered.
   “That’s   unimSortant  now,”   the   Baron  said.  “Feyd   has  beaten  the
slavemaster at cheoSs. Did you hear that?”
   “Yes … Sire.”
   “I  wish you to take three men and Jo to the slavemaster,” the Baron said.
“Garrote the slavemaster. BrinJ his body to me when you’ve Iinished that I
may see it was done SroSerly. We cannot have such ineSt chess Slayers in
our emSloy.”
   Feyd-Rautha went Sale, took a steS Iorward. “But, Uncle, I—”
   “Later,  Feyd,” the Baron said, and waved a hand. “Later.”
   The two  Juards who had Jone to the Baron’s Tuarters Ior the slave boy’s
body staJJered Sast the antechamber door with their load saJJinJ between
them, arms trailinJ. The Baron watched until they were out oI siJht.
   NeIud steSSed uS beside the Baron. “You wish me to kill the slavemaster,
now, my Lord?”
   “Now,”   the Baron said. “And  when you’ve Iinished, add those two who
Must Sassed to your list. I don’t like  the  way they  carried that body. One
should do such thinJs neatly. I’ll wish to see their carcasses, too.”
   NeIud said, “My  Lord, is it anythinJ that I’ve—”
   “Do  as your master has ordered,” Feyd-Rautha said. And he thouJht: All
I can hope for now is to save my own skin.
   Good!  the Baron thouJht. He  yet knows how to cut  his losses. And the
Baron smiled inwardly  at himselI, thinkinJ:  The lad  knows, too, what will
please me and be most apt to stay my wrath from falling on him. He knows I
must preserve him. Who else do I have who could take the reins I must leave
someday? I have  no  other as  capable. But  he  must learn!  And  I  must
preserve myself while he’s learning.

411
   NeIud siJnaled men to assist him, led them out the door.
   “Would  you accomSany me to my chambers, Feyd?” the Baron asked.
   “I   am yours to command,”  Feyd-Rautha said. He bowed, thinkinJ:  I’m
caught.
   “AIter  you,”  the Baron said, and he Jestured to the door.
   Feyd-Rautha indicated  his  Iear  by  only  the barest  hesitation. Have  I
Iailed utterly?  he  asked himselI.  Will  he slip  a  poisoned blade  into  my
back… slowly, through the shield? Does he have an alternative successor ?
   Let him experience this moment of terror, the Baron thouJht as he walked
alonJ behind his neShew. He will succeed me, but at a time of my choosing.
I’ll  not have him throwing away what I’ve built!
   Feyd-Rautha tried not  to walk  too swiItly.  He  Ielt the skin  crawlinJ  on
his back as thouJh his body itselI wondered when the blow could come. His
muscles alternately tensed and rela[ed.
   “Have  you heard the latest word Irom Arrakis?” the Baron asked.
   “No,  Uncle.”
   Feyd-Rautha Iorced himselI  not to  look back. He  turned down the  hall
out oI the servants’ winJ.
   “They’ve   a new  SroShet or reliJious   leader oI  some kind  amonJ the
Fremen,” the Baron said. “They  call him  Muad‘Dib.  Very Iunny, really.  It
means ‘the Mouse.’ I’ve  told  Rabban to let them  have their reliJion.  It’ll
keeS them occuSied.”
   “That’s  very  interestinJ, Uncle,”  Feyd-Rautha said. He  turned into  the
Srivate corridor to his uncle’s Tuarters, wonderinJ: Why does he talk about
religion? Is it some subtle hint to me?
   “Yes, isn’t  it?” the Baron said.
   They came into the Baron’s aSartments throuJh the receStion salon to the
bedchamber. Subtle siJns oI  a struJJle  Jreeted them  here—a susSensor
lamS disSlaced, a bedcushion on the Iloor, a soother-reel sSilled oSen across
a bedstand.
   “It   was a clever Slan,” the Baron said. He keSt his body shield tuned to
ma[imum,  stoSSed, IacinJ his neShew. “But  not clever enouJh. Tell  me,
Feyd, why  didn’t  you strike  me down  yourselI? You’ve  had oSSortunity
enouJh.”
   Feyd-Rautha Iound a susSensor chair, accomSlished a mental shruJ as he
sat down in it without beinJ asked.
   I  must be bold now, he thouJht.

412
   “You  tauJht me that my own hands must remain clean,” he said.
   “Ah,   yes,” the Baron  said. “When  you Iace the  EmSeror, you must be
able to  say  truthIully   that you  did   not  do the  deed. The  witch   at the
EmSeror’s elbow will  hear your words  and know their  truth or Ialsehood.
Yes. I warned you about that.”
   “Why   haven’t you  ever bouJht  a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?”  Feyd-Rautha
asked. “With a Truthsayer at your side—”
   “You  know my tastes!” the Baron snaSSed.
   Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle, said: “Still, one would be valuable Ior—”
   “I   trust them  not!”  the Baron  snarled. “And  stoS tryinJ  to  chanJe the
subMect!”
   Feyd-Rautha sSoke mildly: “As you wish, Uncle.”
   “I  remember a time in the arena several years aJo,” the Baron said.
   “It   seemed there that day a slave had been set to kill  you. Is  that truly
how it was?”
   “It’s  been so lonJ aJo, Uncle. AIter all, I—”
   “No   evasions, Slease,” the Baron  said, and the  tiJhtness oI  his  voice
e[Sosed the rein on his anJer.
   Feyd-Rautha looked at  his uncle, thinkinJ:  He  knows, else he wouldn’t
ask.
   “It  was a sham, Uncle. I arranJed it to discredit your slavemaster.”
   “Very  clever,”  the Baron said. “Brave,  too.  That slave-Jladiator almost
took you, didn’t he?”
   “Yes.”
   “II   you had Iinesse and subtlety to  match such couraJe, you’d be truly
Iormidable.”  The Baron shook his head Irom  side to side. And  as he had
done many  times  since that  terrible  day  on  Arrakis,  he  Iound  himselI
reJrettinJ the  loss oI  Piter, the  Mentat. There’d  been a man oI  delicate,
devilish subtlety. It  hadn’t saved him, thouJh. AJain,  the Baron shook his
head. Fate was sometimes inscrutable.
   Feyd-Rautha Jlanced around the bedchamber, studyinJ the siJns oI  the
struJJle, wonderinJ how his uncle had overcome the slave they’d SreSared
so careIully.
   “How   did I  best him?”  the  Baron asked, “Ah-h-h,  now,  Feyd—let me
keeS some weaSons to Sreserve me in my old aJe. It’s better we use this
time to strike a barJain.”

413
   Feyd-Rautha stared at him. A bargain! He means to keep me as his heir
for  certain,  then. Else  why bargain.  One  bargains with  eTuals  or  near
eTuals!
   “What   barJain,  Uncle?”  And   Feyd-Rautha Ielt  Sroud  that  his  voice
remained calm and reasonable, betrayinJ none oI the elation that Iilled him.
   The  Baron, too,  noted the control.  He nodded. “You’re  Jood  material,
Feyd. I don’t waste Jood material. You Sersist, however, in reIusinJ to learn
my true value to  you. You are obstinate. You do not  see why I  should be
Sreserved as someone oI the utmost value to you. This ….” He Jestured at
the evidence oI the struJJle in the bedchamber. “This was Ioolishness. I do
not reward Ioolishness.”
   Get to the point, you oldfool! Feyd-Rautha thouJht.
   “You  think oI me as an old Iool,” the Baron said. “I must dissuade you oI
that.”
   “You  sSeak oI a barJain.”
   “Ah,    the  imSatience oI   youth,”  the   Baron  said.  “Well,   this  is  the
substance oI it, then: You will cease these Ioolish attemSts on my liIe. And
I, when you are ready Ior it, will  steS aside in your Iavor. I will  retire to an
advisory Sosition, leavinJ you in the seat oI Sower.”
   “Retire,  Uncle?”
   “You  still  think  me the Iool,”  the Baron  said, “and this but  conIirms it,
eh? You think I’m  beJJinJ  you!  SteS cautiously, Feyd. This old Iool  saw
throuJh the shielded needle you’d Slanted in that slave boy’s  thiJh. RiJht
where I’d  Sut  my hand  on it,  eh? The  smallest Sressure and—snick! A
Soison needle in the old Iool’s Salm! Ah-h-h, Feyd….”
   The  Baron shook his head, thinkinJ:  It  would’ve worked, too,  if Hawat
hadn’t warned me. Well, let the lad believe I saw the plot on  my own. In a
way, I did. I  was the one who saved Hawat from the wreckage of Arrakis.
And this lad needs greater respect for my prowess.
   Feyd-Rautha  remained  silent,  struJJlinJ   with   himselI.   Is   he  being
truthful? Does he really mean to retire? Why not? I’m  sure to succeed him
one day if I move carefully. He can’t live  forever. Perhaps it was foolish to
try hurrying the process.
   “You  sSeak oI a barJain,” Feyd-Rautha said. “What SledJe do we Jive to
bind it?”
   “How  can we trust each other, eh?” the Baron asked. “Well, Feyd, as Ior
you: I’m  settinJ  ThuIir  Hawat to watch  over you. I  trust  Hawat’s Mentat

414
caSabilities in this. Do you  understand me? And as Ior me, you’ll  have to
take me on Iaith.  But  I can’t  live  Iorever, can I,  Feyd? And SerhaSs you
should beJin to susSect now that there’re thinJs I know which  you should
know.”
   “I  Jive you my SledJe and what do you Jive me?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
   “I  let you Jo on livinJ,”  the Baron said.
   AJain,  Feyd-Rautha studied his  uncle. He  sets Hawat  over me!  What
would he say if I  told him  Hawat planned the trick  with the gladiator  that
cost him  his slavemaster? He’d  likely  say I  was  lying  in the  attempt to
discredit Hawat. No, the good Thufir  is  a Mentat and has anticipated this
moment.
   “Well,  what do you say?” the Baron asked.
   “What  can I say? I acceSt, oI course.”
   And   Feyd-Rautha thouJht:   Hawat!  He  plays  both  ends  against  the
middle… is  that it?  Has  he moved to  my uncle’s camp  because I didn’t
counsel with him over the slave boy attempt?
   “You  haven’t said anythinJ  about my settinJ  Hawat to watch  you,” the
Baron said.
   Feyd-Rautha betrayed anJer by a IlarinJ oI nostrils. The name oI Hawat
had been a danJer siJnal in the Harkonnen Iamily Ior so many years… and
now it had a new meaninJ: still danJerous.
   “Hawat’s  a danJerous toy,” Feyd-Rautha said.
   “Toy!  Don’t  be stuSid. I know what I  have in Hawat and how to control
it. Hawat has deeS emotions, Feyd. The man without emotions is the one to
Iear. But deeS emotions… ah, now, those can be bent to your needs.”
   “Uncle,  I don’t understand you.”
   “Yes, that’s Slain enouJh.”
   Only  a  Ilicker  oI   eyelids betrayed the  SassaJe oI resentment throuJh
Feyd-Rautha.
   “And  you do not understand Hawat,” the Baron said.
   Nor  do you! Feyd-Rautha thouJht.
   “Who   does Hawat  blame  Ior  his  Sresent circumstances?” the  Baron
asked. “Me? Certainly. But he was an Atreides tool and bested me Ior years
until the ImSerium took a hand. That’s how he sees it. His hate Ior me is a
casual thinJ now. He believes he can best me any time. BelievinJ this, he is
bested. For I direct his attention where I want it—aJainst the ImSerium.”

415
   Tensions oI a  new understandinJ drew tiJht  lines across Feyd-Rautha’s
Iorehead, thinned his mouth. “AJainst the EmSeror?”
   Let my dear nephew try the taste of that, the Baron thouJht. Let him say
to himself: “The  Emperor Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen!”  Let  him ask himself
how much that’s worth. Surely it must be worth the liIe of one old uncle who
could make that dream come to pass!
   Slowly,  Feyd-Rautha wet his liSs with his tonJue. Could  it be true what
the old Iool was sayinJ? There was more here than there seemed to be.
   “And  what has Hawat to do with this?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
   “He  thinks he uses us to wreak his revenJe uSon the EmSeror.”
   “And  when that’s accomSlished?”
   “He  does not think beyond his revenJe. Hawat’s a man who must serve
others, and doesn’t even know this about himselI.”
   “I’ve   learned much Irom Hawat,” Feyd-Rautha aJreed, and Ielt the truth
oI the words as he sSoke them. “But  the more I learn, the more  I Ieel  we
should disSose oI him… and soon.”
   “You  don’t like the idea oI his watchinJ you?”
   “Hawat  watches everybody.”
   “And   he may  Sut you on  a throne. Hawat  is  subtle. He is  danJerous,
devious. But  I’ll    not  yet  withhold  the  antidote  Irom  him.  A   sword  is
danJerous, too, Feyd.  We have  the scabbard Ior   this one,  thouJh.  The
Soison’s in him. When we withdraw the antidote, death will sheathe him.”
   “In   a way, it’s  like  the arena,” Feyd-Rautha said. “Feints  within  Ieints
within Ieints.  You watch to see which way  the Jladiator leans, which way
he looks, how he holds his kniIe.”
   He  nodded to  himselI,  seeinJ that these words  Sleased his uncle, but
thinkinJ: Yes! Like the arena! And the cutting edge is the mind!
   “Now  you see how you need me,” the Baron said. “I’m yet oI use, Feyd.”
   A sword to be wielded until he’s too blunt for use, Feyd-Rautha thouJht.
   “Yes, Uncle,”  he said.
   “And  now,”  the Baron said, “we  will  Jo down  to the slave Tuarters, we
two. And I  will  watch while  you, with your  own hands, kill all  the women
in the Sleasure winJ.”
   “Uncle!”
   “There  will  be other women, Feyd. But I have said that you do not make
a mistake casually with me.”
   Feyd-Rautha’s Iace darkened. “Uncle, you—”

416
   “You   will  acceSt your  Sunishment and learn  somethinJ Irom   it,”  the
Baron said.
   Feyd-Rautha  met the  JloatinJ   stare in  his  uncle’s  eyes. And  I  must
remember this night,  he thought.  And remembering it,  I  must  remember
other nights.
   “You  will  not reIuse,” the Baron said.
   What could you do if I refused, old man? Feyd-Rautha asked himselI. But
he knew there miJht be some other Sunishment, SerhaSs a more subtle one,
a more brutal lever to bend him.
   “I  know you, Feyd,” the Baron said. “You will  not reIuse.”
   All  right, Feyd-Rautha thouJht. I need you now. I see that. The bargain’s
made. But I’ll not always need you. And… someday …

417
        Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense.
        But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.
                                                   —from “The SayinJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  I’VE SAT across from many  rulers  of Great  Houses, but  never seen a  more
gross and dangerous pig  than this  one, ThuIir  Hawat  told  himselI.
    “You  may sSeak Slainly  with  me, Hawat,”   the Baron  rumbled.  He leaned
back in his  susSensor chair, the eyes in their Iolds  oI  Iat borinJ  into  Hawat.
    The  old  Mentat  looked   down  at  the  table  between  him  and  the  Baron
Vladimir   Harkonnen,   notinJ   the  oSulence  oI   its  Jrain.   Even  this   was  a
Iactor  to  consider   in  assessinJ the  Baron,   as were   the  red  walls  oI   this
Srivate conIerence  room and the  Iaint  sweet herb scent that  hunJ on  the air,
maskinJ a deeSer musk.
    “You  didn’t  have  me send that  warninJ  to  Rabban as an idle  whim,”   the
Baron said.
    Hawat’s  leathery   old   Iace  remained  imSassive,  betrayinJ   none   oI  the
loathinJ  he Ielt. “I   susSect many thinJs, my  Lord,”  he said.
    “Yes. Well,  I  wish  to know  how  Arrakis   IiJures  in your  susSicions  about
Salusa Secundus. It  is  not  enouJh  that you  say  to me  the  EmSeror is  in  a
Ierment  about some association  between  Arrakis  and his  mysterious  Srison
Slanet. Now,  I  rushed the  warninJ  out  to  Rabban only  because the  courier
had to leave  on that HeiJhliner.   You  said there could  be no  delay. Well  and
Jood. But  now I  will  have an e[Slanation.”
    He babbles  too  much, Hawat   thought.  He’s not  like  Leto  who  could  tell
me a thing  with  the  lift  of  an  eyebrow or  the  wave of  a hand.  Nor  like  the
Old  Duke who  could  express  an entire  sentence  in the  way  he accented  a
single word.  This is a clod!  Destroying   him will  be a service  to mankind.
    “You  will   not leave  here until  I’ve  had  a Iull  and comSlete  e[Slanation,”
the Baron said.
    “You  sSeak too casually oI  Salusa Secundus,” Hawat  said.
    “It’s   a Senal colony,”   the  Baron  said. “The   worst  riII-raII    in  the Jala[y
are sent to Salusa Secundus. What else do we need to  know?”
    “That  conditions  on the  Srison Slanet are more oSSressive than anywhere
else,” Hawat  said. “You  hear  that the mortality   rate amonJ  new Srisoners  is

418
hiJher than si[ty  Ser cent. You hear that the EmSeror Sractices every Iorm
oI oSSression there. You hear all this and do not ask Tuestions?”
   “The  EmSeror doesn’t Sermit the Great Houses to insSect his Srison,” the
Baron Jrowled. “But he hasn’t seen into my dunJeons, either.”
   “And   curiosity  about Salusa Secundus is…  ah….”  Hawat Sut  a bony
IinJer to his liSs. “… discouraJed.”
   “So  he’s not Sroud oI some oI the thinJs he must do there!”
   Hawat  allowed  the Iaintest  oI  smiles to  touch his  dark liSs.  His  eyes
Jlinted in the Jlowtube  liJht  as he stared at the Baron. “And you’ve never
wondered where the EmSeror Jets his Sardaukar?”
   The Baron Sursed his Iat liSs. This Jave his Ieatures the look oI a SoutinJ
baby, and his voice  carried a  tone oI  Setulance as he said: “Why  …  he
recruits… that is to say, there are the levies and he enlists Irom—”
   “Faaa!”  Hawat snaSSed. “The stories you hear about the e[Sloits oI the
Sardaukar, they’re not rumors, are they? Those are Iirst-hand accounts Irom
the limited number oI survivors who’ve IouJht aJainst the Sardaukar, eh?”
   “The  Sardaukar are e[cellent  IiJhtinJ   men, no doubt oI  it,”   the Baron
said. “But I think my own leJions—”
   “A   Sack oI holiday e[cursionists  by comSarison!” Hawat  snarled. “You
think I don’t know why  the EmSeror turned aJainst House Atreides?”
   “This  is not a realm oSen to your sSeculation,” the Baron warned.
   Is  it possible that  even he doesn’t know what motivated the Emperor in
this? Hawat asked himselI.
   “Any   area is oSen to my sSeculation iI it does what you’ve  hired me to
do,”  Hawat said.  “I   am a  Mentat. You  do  not  withhold  inIormation  or
comSutation lines Irom a Mentat.”
   For  a lonJ  minute, the Baron stared at him,  then: “Say  what you  must
say, Mentat.”
   “The   Padishah EmSeror  turned  aJainst House  Atreides  because the
Duke’s  Warmasters Gurney  Halleck  and  Duncan  Idaho  had  trained  a
IiJhtinJ  Iorce—a  small  IiJhtinJ   Iorce—to  within  a  hair  as Jood  as the
Sardaukar. Some oI them were even better. And the Duke was in a Sosition
to enlarJe his Iorce, to make it every bit as stronJ as the EmSeror’s.”
   The  Baron weiJhed this disclosure, then: “What  has Arrakis to  do with
this?”
   “It  Srovides a Sool oI recruits already conditioned to the bitterest survival
traininJ.”

419
   The Baron shook his head. “You cannot mean the Fremen?”
   “I  mean the Fremen.”
   “Hah!  Then why  warn Rabban? There cannot be more than a handIul oI
Fremen leIt aIter the Sardaukar SoJrom and Rabban’s oSSression.”
   Hawat continued to stare at him silently.
   “Not   more  than  a  handIul!”  the  baron  reSeated. “Rabban killed   si[
thousand oI them last year alone!”
   Still,  Hawat stared at him.
   “And  the year beIore it was nine thousand,” the baron said. “And beIore
they leIt, the Sardaukar must’ve accounted Ior at least twenty thousand.”
   “What  are Rabban’s trooS losses Ior the Sast two years?” Hawat asked.
   The Baron rubbed his Mowls. “Well, he has been recruitinJ rather heavily,
to be sure. His aJents make rather e[travaJant Sromises and—”
   “Shall  we say thirty thousand in round numbers?” Hawat asked.
   “That  would seem a little hiJh,” the baron said.
   “Quite   the  contrary,”  Hawat  said.  “I   can read  between the  lines  oI
Rabban’s reSorts as well as you can. And you certainly must’ve understood
my reSorts Irom our aJents.”
   “Arrakis  is a Iierce Slanet,” the Baron said. “Storm losses can—”
   “We both know the IiJure Ior  storm accretion,” Hawat said.
   “What  iI  he has lost  thirty  thousand?” the Baron demanded, and blood
darkened his Iace.
   “By   your own count,”  Hawat said, “he killed  IiIteen  thousand over two
years while losinJ twice that number. You say the Sardaukar accounted Ior
another  twenty  thousand,  Sossibly  a   Iew   more.  And   I’ve   seen  the
transSortation maniIests Ior their return Irom Arrakis. II  they killed  twenty
thousand, they lost almost Iive Ior one. Why  won’t you  Iace these IiJures,
Baron, and understand what they mean?”
   The  Baron  sSoke in  a  coldly   measured cadence: “This  is  your  Mob,
Mentat. What do they mean?”
   “I  Jave you Duncan Idaho’s head count on the sietch he visited,” Hawat
said. “It    all  Iits.   II  they   had Must two  hundred  and  IiIty   such  sietch
communities,  their  SoSulation  would  be  about  Iive   million.   My   best
estimate is that they had at least twice that many communities. You scatter
your SoSulation on such a Slanet.”
   “Ten million?”
   The Baron’s Mowls Tuivered with amazement.

420
   “At  least.”
   The Baron Sursed his Iat liSs. The beady eyes stared without waverinJ at
Hawat. Is this true  Mentat computation? he wondered. How could this  be
and no one suspect?
   “We  haven’t even cut heavily into their birth-rate-Jrowth  IiJure,”  Hawat
said. “We’ve  Must weeded out some oI   their  less successIul sSecimens,
leavinJ the stronJ to Jrow stronJer—Must like on Salusa Secundus.”
   “Salusa  Secundus!” the  Baron barked. “What   has this to  do  with  the
EmSeror’s Srison Slanet?”
   “A  man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out beinJ touJher than most
others,” Hawat said. “When you add the very best oI military traininJ—”
   “Nonsense!  By your  arJument, Icould  recruit  Irom  amonJ the Fremen
aIter the way they’ve been oSSressed by my neShew.”
   Hawat sSoke in a mild voice: “Don’t you oSSress any oI your trooSs?”
   “Well…  I…  but—”
   “OSSression is  a relative  thinJ,”   Hawat said.  “Your  IiJhtinJ   men are
much  better  oII   than  those  around  them,  heh?  They  see  unSleasant
alternative to beinJ soldiers oI the Baron, heh?”
   The  Baron  Iell  silent,  eyes unIocused. The Sossibilities—had  Rabban
unwittinJly  Jiven House Harkonnen its ultimate weaSon?
   Presently  he  said:  “How   could  you  be  sure oI   the loyalty   oI   such
recruits?”
   “I   would take  them in  small JrouSs, not larJer  than Slatoon strenJth,”
Hawat said. “I’d   remove them Irom  their oSSressive situation and isolate
them with  a  traininJ  cadre oI  SeoSle who understood their  backJround,
SreIerably SeoSle who   had  Sreceded them Irom   the  same  oSSressive
situation. Then I’d  Iill  them with  the mystiTue that their  Slanet had really
been a  secret traininJ  Jround  to  Sroduce Must such suSerior beinJs  as
themselves. And all  the while,  I’d  show them  what such suSerior beinJs
could earn: rich  livinJ,  beautiIul  women, Iine  mansions… whatever they
desired.”
   The Baron beJan to nod. “The way the Sardaukar live at home.”
   “The   recruits  come  to  believe  in  time  that  such  a  Slace as  Salusa
Secundus is MustiIied because it Sroduced them—the elite. The commonest
Sardaukar trooSer lives a liIe, in  many resSects, as e[alted as that oI any
member oI a Great House.”
   “Such an idea!” the Baron whisSered.

421
   “You  beJin to share my susSicions,” Hawat said.
   “Where did  such a thinJ start?” the Baron asked.
   “Ah,   yes: Where  did  House Corrino  oriJinate?  Were there SeoSle on
Salusa Secundus beIore the EmSeror sent his Iirst continJents oI Srisoners
there? Even the Duke Leto,  a cousin on  the distaII  side, never knew  Ior
sure. Such Tuestions are not encouraJed.”
   The Baron’s eyes Jlazed with thouJht. “Yes, a very careIully keSt secret.
They’d use every device oI—”
   “Besides,  what’s there  to  conceal?” Hawat  asked. “That  the Padishah
EmSeror has a Srison Slanet? Everyone knows this. That he has—”
   “Count  FenrinJ!” the Baron blurted.
   Hawat  broke  oII,  studied the  Baron with   a Suzzled Irown.   “What  oI
Count FenrinJ?”
   “At   my  neShew’s birthday  several years aJo,”  the  Baron  said. “This
ImSerial SoSinMay, Count FenrinJ, came as oIIicial observer and to … ah,
conclude a business arranJement between the EmSeror and myselI.”
   “So?”
   “I   …  ah, durinJ  one oI  our  conversations, I believe  I  said somethinJ
about makinJ a Srison Slanet oI Arrakis. FenrinJ—”
   “What  did you say e[actly?” Hawat asked.
   “E[actly?  That was Tuite a while aJo and—”
   “My   Lord Baron,  iI you  wish to make the best use oI my  services, you
must Jive me adeTuate inIormation. Wasn’t this conversation recorded ?”
   The  Baron’s Iace darkened with anJer. “You’re  as bad as Piter! I  don’t
like these—”
   “Piter  is no lonJer with you, my Lord,”  Hawat said. “As to that, whatever
did haSSen to Piter?”
   “He  became too Iamiliar, too demandinJ oI me,” the Baron said.
   “You  assure me you don’t  waste a useIul man,” Hawat  said. “Will  you
waste me by threats and TuibblinJ? We were discussinJ what you  said to
Count FenrinJ.”
   Slowly,   the Baron  comSosed his  Ieatures. When the  time  comes, he
thouJht, I’ll  remember his manner with me. Yes. I will remember.
   “One moment,”  the Baron said, and he thouJht back to the meetinJ in his
Jreat hall. It helSed to visualize the cone oI silence in which they had stood.
“I  said  somethinJ like   this,”  the Baron  said.  “  ‘The  EmSeror knows  a
certain amount  oI  killinJ   has always  been an  arm  oI  business.’ I   was

422
reIerrinJ to our work Iorce losses. Then I said somethinJ about considerinJ
another solution to the Arrakeen Sroblem and I  said the EmSeror’s Srison
Slanet insSired me to emulate him.”
   “Witch  blood!”  Hawat snaSSed. “What did FenrinJ say?”
   “That’s  when he beJan TuestioninJ me about you.”
   Hawat  sat back, closed his eyes in thouJht. “So  that’s why they  started
lookinJ into Arrakis,”  he said. “Well, the thinJ’s done.” He oSened his eyes.
“They must have sSies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!”
   “But  certainly my innocent suJJestion that—”
   “NothinJ  is  innocent in an EmSeror’s eyes! What were your instructions
to Rabban?”
   “Merely  that he should teach Arrakis to Iear us.”
   Hawat shook his head. “You now  have two alternatives, Baron. You can
kill oII  the natives, wiSe them out entirely, or—”
   “Waste an entire work Iorce?”
   “Would  you SreIer to  have the EmSeror and those Great Houses he can
still swinJ  behind him come in here and SerIorm a curettement, scraSe out
Giedi Prime like a hollow Jourd?”
   The Baron studied his Mentat, then: “He wouldn’t dare!”
   “Wouldn’t  he?”
   The Baron’s liSs Tuivered. “What is your alternative?”
   “Abandon  your dear neShew, Rabban.”
   “Aband  ….” The Baron broke oII, stared at Hawat.
   “Send  him   no  more  trooSs, no  aid  oI   any  kind.  Don’t   answer his
messaJes other than to say you’re heard oI  the terrible way  he’s handled
thinJs on  Arrakis and  you intend  to take corrective  measures as soon as
you’re  able. I’ll   arranJe to  have some oI  your  messaJes interceSted by
ImSerial sSies.”
   “But  what oI the sSice, the revenues, the—”
   “Demand  your   baronial  SroIits,  but  be careIul  how   you  make your
demands. ReTuire Ii[ed sums oI Rabban. We can—”
   The Baron turned his hands Salms uS. “But how can I be certain that my
weasel neShew isn’t—”
   “We  still have our sSies on Arrakis. Tell Rabban he either meets the sSice
Tuotas you set him or he’ll be reSlaced.”
   “I   know  my  neShew,”  the Baron  said.  “This  would   only  make  him
oSSress the SoSulation even more.”

423
   “OI  course he will!”  Hawat snaSSed. “You don’t want that stoSSed now!
You merely  want your  own  hands clean. Let  Rabban make your  Salusa
Secundus Ior you. There’s no need even to send him any Srisoners. He has
all the  SoSulation reTuired. II Rabban is drivinJ   his SeoSle to meet your
sSice Tuotas, then the EmSeror need susSect no other motive. That’s reason
enouJh Ior SuttinJ the Slanet on the rack. And you, Baron, will not show by
word or action that there’s any other reason Ior this.”
   The  Baron could  not keeS the sly tone  oI admiration  out oI  his voice.
“Ah, Hawat, you are a devious one. Now, how do we move into Arrakis and
make use oI what Rabban SreSares?”
   “That’s  the simSlest thinJ oI all, Baron. II you  set each year’s Tuota a bit
hiJher than the one beIore, matters will soon reach a head there. Production
will  droS oII. You can remove Rabban and take over yourselI… to correct
the mess.”
   “It   Iits,”  the  Baron said. “But   I  can Ieel myselI  tirinJ   oI  all this.  I’m
SreSarinJ another to take over Arrakis Ior me.”
   Hawat studied the Iat round Iace across Irom him. Slowly the old soldier-
sSy beJan to nod his head. “Feyd-Rautha,” he said. “So that’s the reason Ior
the oSSression now. You’re very devious yourselI, Baron. PerhaSs we can
incorSorate these two schemes. Yes. Your Feyd-Rautha can Jo to Arrakis as
their savior. He can win the SoSulace. Yes.”
   The  Baron smiled. And  behind his  smile, he  asked himselI: Now, how
does this fit in with Hawat’s personal scheming?
   And  Hawat, seeinJ that he was dismissed, arose and leIt the red-walled
room. As he walked, he could  not Sut down the disturbinJ unknowns that
croSSed into every comSutation about Arrakis.  This new  reliJious leader
that Gurney Halleck hinted at Irom  his hidinJ  Slace amonJ the smuJJlers,
this Muad’Dib.
   Perhaps I  should  not have  told  the Baron  to let  this  religion  flourish
where it will,  even among the folk of pan and graben, he told himself. But
it’s well known that repression makes a religion flourish.
   And  he  thouJht about  Halleck’s reSorts on  Fremen battle tactics.  The
tactics smacked oI Halleck himselI… and Idaho… and even oI Hawat.
   Did  Idaho survive? he asked himselI.
   But  this  was  a Iutile   Tuestion. He  did  not yet  ask  himselI  iI  it  was
Sossible that Paul had survived. He knew the Baron was convinced that all
Atreides were dead. The  Bene Gesserit witch  had been his  weaSon, the

424
Baron admitted.  And  that  could only   mean an end  to  all—even  to the
woman’s own son.
   What  a  poisonous hate she must’ve had  for  the Atreides,  he thought.
Something like the hate I hold for this Baron. Will  my blow be as final and
complete as hers?

425
        There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and
        grace—those Tualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in
        the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the
        creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our
        society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril
        in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity.
        In such perfection, all things move toward death.
                                         —from “The Collected SayinJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan



 
P AUL-MUAD’DIB        remembered     that  there   had   been  a  meal   heavy    with
sSice essence.  He  clunJ   to  this  memory   because  it  was  an anchor   Soint  and
he could   tell  himselI    Irom   this  vantaJe   that  his  immediate    e[Serience    must
be a dream.
    I  am  a theater   of  processes,  he  told  himselI.    I  am a  prey  to  the  imperfect
vision,  to  the  race  consciousness   and its  terrible    purpose.
    Yet,  he  could   not  escaSe  the  Iear  that  he  had  somehow   overrun   himselI,
lost  his Sosition   in  time,   so that  Sast and  Iuture  and  Sresent  minJled   without
distinction.    It  was   a kind   oI  visual    IatiJue   and  it  came,   he knew,   Irom   the
constant  necessity   oI  holdinJ    the  Srescient   Iuture  as  a kind   oI  memory   that
was in  itselI   a thinJ   intrinsically     oI the  Sast.
    Chani   prepared   the meal  forme,   he told   himselI.
    Yet  Chani   was  deeS in  the  south—in    the cold   country   where   the sun  was
hot—secreted   in  one  oI  the new  sietch  stronJholds,    saIe  with   their  son,  Leto
II.
    Or,  was  that a  thinJ  yet  to  haSSen?
    No,   he reassured   himselI,    Ior  Alia-the-StranJe-One,       his  sister,   had  Jone
there   with    his  mother    and   with    Chani—a     twenty-thumSer     triS    into   the
south,  ridinJ    a  Reverend    Mother’s    SalanTuin   Ii[ed     to  the  back   oI   a wild
maker.
    He   shied   away    Irom    the   thouJht    oI   ridinJ     the   Jiant    worms,    askinJ
himselI:   Or  is  Alia  yet  to be  born?
    I  was  on  razzia,   Paul   recalled.   We  went  raiding    to  recover    the  water   of
our  dead  in  Arrakeen.    And  I  found   the  remains   of  my  father   in  the  funeral
pyre.   I    enshrined     the   skull     of   my    father    in    a   Fremen     rock    mound
overlooking    Harg  Pass.
    Or  was  that a  thinJ  yet  to  be?

426
   My  wounds are real, Paul told himselI. My  scars are real. The shrine of
my father’s skull is real.
   Still   in the  dreamlike state, Paul remembered that Harah, Jamis’  wiIe,
had intruded on him once to say there’d been a IiJht in the sietch corridor.
That had been the interim sietch beIore the women and children had been
sent into the deeS south. Harah had stood there in the entrance to the inner
chamber, the black winJs oI her  hair tied back by  water rinJs on  a chain.
She had held aside the chamber’s hanJinJs and told him that Chani had Must
killed someone.
   This happened, Paul told himselI. This was real, not born  out of its time
and subject to change.
   Paul remembered he had rushed out to Iind  Chani standinJ beneath the
yellow Jlobes oI the corridor, clad in  a brilliant  blue wraSaround robe with
hood thrown back, a Ilush  oI e[ertion  on  her elIin Ieatures. She had been
sheathinJ her cryskniIe. A huddled JrouS had been hurryinJ away down the
corridor with a burden.
   And  Paul remembered tellinJ  himselI:  You always know  when they’re
carryinJ a body.
   Chani’s  water rinJs,  worn oSenly in  sietch on a  cord around her neck,
tinkled as she turned toward him.
   “Chani,  what is this?” he asked.
   “I  disSatched one who came to challenJe you in sinJle combat, Usul.”
   “You killed  him?”
   “Yes. But SerhaSs I should’ve leIt him Ior Harah.”
   (And  Paul recalled how the Iaces oI the SeoSle around them had showed
aSSreciation Ior these words. Even Harah had lauJhed.)
   “But  he came to challenJe me!”
   “You  trained me yourselI in the weirdinJ way, Usul.”
   “Certainly!  But you shouldn’t—”
   “I  was born in the desert, Usul. I know how to use a cryskniIe.”
   He  suSSressed his anJer, tried to talk reasonably. “This may all be true,
Chani, but—”
   “I  am no  lonJer a child huntinJ  scorSions in the sietch by the liJht  oI a
handJlobe, Usul. I do not Slay James.”
   Paul Jlared at her, cauJht by the odd Ierocity beneath her casual attitude.
   “He  was not worthy, Usul,” Chani said. “I’d  not disturb your meditations
with the likes oI him.”  She moved closer, lookinJ at him out oI  the corners

427
oI her eyes, droSSinJ her voice so that only he miJht hear. “And, beloved,
when it’s learned that a challenJer may Iace me and be brouJht to shameIul
death by Muad’Dib’s woman, there’ll be Iewer challenJers.”
   Yes, Paul told himselI, that had certainly happened. It was true-past. And
the number of  challengers testing  the new  blade of  Muad’Dib   did drop
dramatically.
   Somewhere, in a world not-oI-the-dream, there was a hint oI motion, the
cry oI a niJhtbird.
   I  dream, Paul reassured himselI. It’s the spice meal.
   Still,  there was about him  a IeelinJ oI  abandonment. He wondered iI it
miJht  be Sossible that his  ruh-sSirit had  sliSSed over somehow into  the
world where the Fremen believed he had his true e[istence—into the alam
al-mithal,  the  world   oI  similitudes,  that  metaShysical realm  where  all
Shysical limitations were removed. And he knew Iear at the thouJht oI such
a Slace, because removal oI all limitations meant removal  oI all  Soints oI
reIerence. In the landscaSe oI a myth he could not orient himselI and say: “I
am I because I am here.”
   His mother had said once: “The SeoSle are divided, some oI them, in how
they think oI you.”
   I   must be  waking  from  the  dream,  Paul  told  himselI.  For   this  had
haSSened—these words Irom his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a
Reverend Mother oI the Fremen, these words had Sassed throuJh reality.
   Jessica was IearIul oI the reliJious  relationshiS between himselI and the
Fremen, Paul knew. She didn’t like the Iact  that SeoSle oI both sietch and
Jraben reIerred to Muad’Dib as Him. And she went TuestioninJ amonJ the
tribes,  sendinJ  out  her  Sayyadina  sSies, collectinJ  their   answers and
broodinJ on them.
   She had  Tuoted a Bene Gesserit Sroverb  to him:  “When  reliJion   and
Solitics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothinJ can stand in their
way. Their movement become headlonJ—Iaster and Iaster and Iaster. They
Sut aside all thouJht oI obstacles and IorJet that a SreciSice does not show
itselI to the man in a blind rush until it’s too late.”
   Paul recalled that he had sat there in  his mother’s Tuarters, in the inner
chamber shrouded by dark hanJinJs with their surIaces covered by woven
Satterns out oI Fremen mytholoJy. He had sat there, hearinJ her out, notinJ
the way she was always observinJ—even when her eyes were lowered. Her
oval Iace had new lines in it  at the corners oI the mouth,  but the hair was

428
still  like  Solished bronze. The  wide-set Jreen eyes, thouJh,  hid  beneath
their overcastinJ oI sSice-imbued blue.
   “The  Fremen have a simSle, Sractical reliJion,” he said.
   “NothinJ  about reliJion is simSle,” she warned.
   But  Paul,  seeinJ the  clouded Iuture  that  still  hunJ  over  them, Iound
himselI swayed by anJer. He could only  say: “ReliJion  uniIies our Iorces.
It’s our mystiTue.”
   “You   deliberately cultivate   this air,  this  bravura,”  she  charJed. “You
never cease indoctrinatinJ.”
   “Thus  you yourselI tauJht me,” he said.
   But  she had been Iull oI contentions and arJuments that day. It had been
the day oI the circumcision  ceremony Ior little  Leto.  Paul had understood
some oI the reasons Ior her uSset. She had never acceSted his liaison—the
“marriaJe oI youth”—with  Chani. But Chani had Sroduced an Atreides son,
and Jessica had Iound herselI unable to reMect the child with the mother.
   Jessica had  stirred  Iinally   under  his  stare,  said:  “You  think   me  an
unnatural mother.”
   “OI  course not.”
   “I   see the way  you  watch  me when  I’m   with  your  sister. You  don’t
understand about your sister.”
   “I   know why  Alia  is diIIerent,”  he said. “She  was unborn, Sart oI you,
when you chanJed the Water oI LiIe. She—”
   “You  know nothinJ oI it!”
   And  Paul, suddenly unable to  e[Sress the knowledJe  Jained out oI  its
time, said only: “I don’t think  you unnatural.”
   She saw his distress, said: “There is a thinJ, Son.”
   “Yes?”
   “I  do love your Chani. I acceSt her.”
   This  was real, Paul told himselI.  This wasn’t  the imSerIect vision to be
chanJed by the twistinJs out oI time’s own birth.
   The reassurance Jave him a new hold on his world.  Bits oI solid  reality
beJan to diS throuJh the dream state into his awareness. He knew suddenly
that he was in a hiereJ, a desert camS. Chani had Slanted their stilltent on
Ilour-sand Ior  its  soItness. That  could only  mean  Chani was  near by—
Chani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert sSrinJ, Chani uS Irom
the Salmaries oI the deeS south.

429
   Now,  he remembered her sinJinJ a  sand chanty to him  in the time  Ior
sleeS.

       “O  my soul, 
       Have no taste Ior Paradise this niJht,  
       And I  swear by Shai-hulud                
       You will  Jo there,               
       Obedient to my love.” 

   And  she had sunJ the walkinJ sonJ lovers shared on the sand, its rhythm
like the draJ oI the dunes aJainst the Ieet:

       “Tell  me oI thine eyes 
       And I  will  tell thee oI thy heart.  
       Tell me oI thy Ieet                      
       And I  will  tell thee oI thy hands. 
       Tell me oI thy sleeSinJ                
       And I  will  tell thee oI thy wakinJ.  
       Tell me oI thy desires                    
       And I  will  tell thee oI thy need.” 

   He  had heard someone strumminJ a  baliset in  another tent. And  he’d
thouJht then oI Gurney  Halleck. Reminded by the Iamiliar  instrument, he
had thouJht oI Gurney whose Iace he had seen in a smuJJler band, but who
had not seen him, could not see him or know oI him lest that inadvertently
lead the Harkonnens to the son oI the Duke they had killed.
   But  the style oI the Slayer in the niJht,  the distinctiveness oI the IinJers
on the baliset’s strinJs, brouJht the real musician back to Paul’s memory. It
had been Chatt the  LeaSer, caStain oI the Fedaykin,  leader oI  the death
commandos who Juarded Muad’Dib.
   We are in the desert, Paul remembered. We are in the central erg beyond
the Harkonnen patrols. I  am  here to walk  the sand, to lure  a maker  and
mount him by my own cunning that I may be a Fremen entire.
   He Ielt  now the maula Sistol at his belt, the cryskniIe. He Ielt the silence
surroundinJ him.
   It  was that sSecial Sre-morninJ silence when the niJhtbirds had Jone and
the day creatures had not yet siJnaled their alertness to their enemy, the sun.

430
   “You  must ride the sand in the liJht oI  day that Shai-hulud shall see and
know you have no Iear,”  StilJar  had said. “Thus we turn  our time around
and set ourselves to sleeS this niJht.”
   Quietly, Paul sat uS, IeelinJ the looseness oI a slacked stillsuit around his
body, the shadowed stilltent beyond. So soItly he moved, yet Chani  heard
him.
   She sSoke Irom the tent’s Jloom, another shadow there: “It’s not yet Iull
liJht, beloved.”
   “Sihaya,”  he said, sSeakinJ with halI a lauJh in his voice.
   “You  call me your desert sSrinJ,” she said, “but this day I’m  thy Joad. I
am the Sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed.”
   He  beJan tiJhteninJ  his  stillsuit.  “You  told  me once the words  oI  the
Kitab al-Ibar,”  he said. “You told  me: ”Woman is thy  Iield;  Jo then to thy
Iield and till it.’”
   “I  am the mother oI thy Iirstborn,” she aJreed.
   He  saw  her in  the  Jrayness matchinJ  him  movement Ior  movement,
securinJ her stillsuit  Ior the  oSen desert. “You should Jet all  the rest you
can,” she said.
   He  recoJnized her  love Ior  him  sSeakinJ then and chided  her Jently:
“The Sayyadina oI the Watch does not caution or warn the candidate.”
   She slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her Salm. “Today, I am
both the watcher and the woman.”
   “You  should’ve leIt this duty to another,” he said.
   “WaitinJ  is bad enouJh at best,” she said. “I’d sooner be at thy side.”
   He  kissed her Salm beIore securinJ the IaceIlaS oI his suit, then turned
and cracked the seal oI the tent. The air that came in to them held the chill
not-Tuite-dryness that would  SreciSitate trace dew  in  the dawn.  With  it
came the smell oI a Sre-sSice mass, the mass they had detected oII to the
northeast, and that told them there would be a maker near by.
   Paul  crawled  throuJh  the  sShincter oSeninJ,  stood on  the  sand and
stretched the sleeS Irom  his  muscles. A   Iaint  Jreen-Searl luminescence
etched the eastern horizon. The tents oI his  trooS were small Ialse dunes
around him in the Jloom. He saw movement oII to the leIt—the Juard, and
knew they had seen him.
   They  knew the Seril he Iaced this day. Each Fremen had Iaced it. They
Jave him  this last  Iew  moments oI  isolation  now that  he miJht  SreSare
himselI.

431
   It  must be done today, he told himselI.
   He  thouJht oI the Sower he wielded in  the Iace oI the SoJrom—the old
men who sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirdinJ way oI battle,
the old men who listened to him now in council and Iollowed his Slans, the
men who returned to Say him that hiJhest Fremen comSliment : “Your Slan
worked, Muad’Dib.”
   Yet the meanest and smallest oI the Fremen warriors could do a thinJ that
he had  never  done.  And  Paul  knew  his  leadershiS suIIered  Irom   the
omniSresent knowledJe oI this diIIerence between them.
   He had not ridden the maker.
   Oh, he’d  Jone uS with the others Ior traininJ  triSs and raids, but he had
not made his  own  voyaJe. Until  he  did,  his world  was  bounded by the
abilities oI others. No true Fremen could Sermit this. Until he did this thinJ
himselI, even the Jreat southlands—the area some twenty thumSers beyond
the erJ—were denied him  unless he ordered a SalanTuin and rode like  a
Reverend Mother or one oI the sick and wounded.
   Memory  returned to him oI his wrestlinJ with his inner awareness durinJ
the niJht. He saw a stranJe Sarallel here—iI he mastered the maker, his rule
was strenJthened; iI   he  mastered the inward  eye,  this  carried  its  own
measure oI command. But beyond them both lay the clouded area, the Great
Unrest where all the universe seemed embroiled.
   The diIIerences in  the ways he comSrehended the universe haunted him
—accuracy matched with inaccuracy. He saw it  in  situ. Yet,  when it  was
born, when it came into the Sressures oI reality, the now had its own liIe and
Jrew  with  its  own  subtle  diIIerences. Terrible  SurSose remained. Race
consciousness remained. And over all loomed the Mihad, bloody and wild.
   Chani Moined him outside the tent, huJJinJ her elbows, lookinJ uS at him
Irom the corners oI her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood.
   “Tell  me aJain about the waters oI thy birthworld, Usul,” she said.
   He  saw that she was  tryinJ  to distract  him,  ease his mind oI  tensions
beIore the deadly test. It was JrowinJ liJhter, and he noted that some oI his
Fedaykin were already strikinJ their tents.
   “I’d   rather  you told  me about  the sietch and  about our son,”  he said.
“Does our Leto yet hold my mother in his Salm?”
   “It’s  Alia  he holds as well,”  she said. “And he Jrows  raSidly. He’ll  be a
biJ man.”
   “What’s  it like in  the south?” he asked.

432
   “When  you ride the maker you’ll see Ior yourselI,” she said.
   “But  I wish to see it Iirst throuJh your eyes.”
   “It’s  SowerIully lonely,”  she said.
   He touched the nezhoni scarI at her Iorehead where it Srotruded Irom her
stillsuit caS. “Why will  you not talk about the sietch?”
   “I  have talked about it. The sietch is a lonely Slace without our men. It’s
a Slace oI work. We labor in the Iactories and the SottinJ rooms. There are
weaSons to be made, Soles to Slant that we may Iorecast the weather, sSice
to collect Ior  the bribes. There are dunes to be Slanted to make them Jrow
and to anchor them. There are Iabrics and ruJs to make, Iuel cells to charJe.
There are children to train that the tribe’s strenJth may never be lost.”
   “Is  nothinJ then Sleasant in the sietch?” he asked.
   “The  children are Sleasant. We observe the rites. We have suIIicient Iood.
Sometimes one oI us may come north to be with her man. LiIe must Jo on.”
   “My  sister, Alia—is  she acceSted yet by the SeoSle?”
   Chani turned toward him  in the JrowinJ  dawnliJht.  Her eyes bored into
him. “It’s a thinJ to be discussed another time, beloved.”
   “Let  us discuss it now.”
   “You  should conserve your enerJies Ior the test,” she said.
   He saw that he had touched somethinJ sensitive, hearinJ the withdrawal
in her voice. “The unknown brinJs its own worries,” he said.
   Presently she nodded, said, “There is yet… misunderstandinJ because oI
Alia’s stranJeness. The women are IearIul because a child little more than
an inIant  talks… oI  thinJs  that only  an adult  should know.  They do  not
understand the… chanJe in the womb that made Alia… diIIerent.”
   “There is trouble?”  he asked. And he thouJht: I’ve seen visions of trouble
over Alia.
   Chani  looked  toward  the  JrowinJ  line  oI   the sunrise.  “Some oI   the
women banded to  aSSeal to the  Reverend Mother. They  demanded she
e[orcise the demon in her dauJhter. They Tuoted the scriSture: ‘SuIIer not a
witch to live amonJ us.’ ”
   “And  what did my mother say to them?”
   “She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: ‘II Alia
incites trouble, it  is the Iault  oI authority  Ior not  IorseeinJ and SreventinJ
the trouble.’ And she tried to e[Slain how the chanJe had worked on Alia in
the womb. But the women were anJry because they had been embarrassed.
They went away mutterinJ.”

433
   There will  be trouble because of Alia, he thouJht.
   A   crystal blowinJ   oI  sand touched the  e[Sosed Sortions oI  his  Iace,
brinJinJ  the scent oI  the Sre-sSice mass. “Ei Sayal, the rain oI  sand that
brinJs the morninJ,” he said.
   He looked out across the Jray liJht oI the desert landscaSe, the landscaSe
beyond Sity,  the  sand that  was  Iorm  absorbed in  itselI.   Dry  liJhtninJ
streaked a dark corner to the south—siJn that a storm had built uS its static
charJe there. The roll oI thunder boomed lonJ aIter.
   “The  voice that beautiIies the land,” Chani said.
   More  oI his men were stirrinJ  out oI their  tents. Guards were cominJ in
Irom  the  rims.  EverythinJ  around him   moved smoothly  in  the  ancient
routine that reTuired no orders.
   “Give  as Iew orders as Sossible,” his Iather had told him … once … lonJ
aJo. “Once you’ve Jiven  orders on a subMect, you must always Jive orders
on that subMect.”
   The Fremen knew this rule instinctively.
   The trooS’s watermaster beJan the morninJ chanty, addinJ to it now the
call Ior the rite to initiate a sandrider.
   “The  world  is a carcass,” the man chanted, his voice wailinJ  across the
dunes. “Who  can turn  away  the AnJel  oI  Death?  What Shai-hulud  has
decreed must be.”
   Paul listened, recoJnizinJ  that these were the words that also beJan the
death chant oI his Fedaykin, the words the death commandos recited as they
hurled themselves into battle.
   Will  there be a rock shrine here this day to mark  the passing of another
soul? Paul asked himselI. Will Fremen stop here in the future, each to add
another stone and think on Muad’Dib who died in this place?
   He knew  this was amonJ the alternatives today, a fact alonJ lines oI the
Iuture  radiatinJ  Irom  this  Sosition  in  time-sSace. The imSerIect  vision
SlaJued him. The more he resisted his terrible SurSose and IouJht aJainst
the cominJ  oI  the  Mihad, the Jreater the turmoil   that wove  throuJh  his
Srescience. His entire Iuture was becominJ like  a river  hurtlinJ  toward  a
chasm—the violent ne[us beyond which all was IoJ and clouds.
   “StilJar  aSSroaches,” Chani said. “I must stand aSart now, beloved. Now,
I must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reSorted truly in the
Chronicles.” She looked uS at him and, Ior a moment, her reserve sliSSed,

434
then she had herselI under control. “When this  is Sast, I shall SreSare thy
breakIast with my own hands,” she said. She turned away.
   StilJar  moved  toward him  across the Ilour  sand, stirrinJ  uS little   dust
Suddles. The dark niches oI his  eyes remained steady on Paul with  their
untamed stare. The JlimSse oI  black  beard above the stillsuit   mask, the
lines oI craJJy  cheeks, could have been wind-etched Irom the native rock
Ior all their movement.
   The man carried Paul’s banner on its  staII—the Jreen and black banner
with a water tube in  the staII—that already was a leJend in the land.  HalI
SrideIully, Paul thouJht: I cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming
a legend. They will  mark how I  parted from  Chani, how I  greet Stilgar—
every move I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. I must not die. Then
it will  be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad.
   StilJar  Slanted the staII in the sand beside Paul, droSSed his hands to his
sides. The  blue-within-blue   eyes remained  level  and  intent.  And  Paul
thouJht how his own  eyes already were assuminJ this mask oI color Irom
the sSice.
   “They  denied us the HaMM,” StilJar said with ritual solemnity.
   As  Chani had tauJht him, Paul resSonded: “Who can deny a Fremen the
riJht to walk or ride where he wills?”
   “I   am a Naib,”  StilJar  said, “never to be  taken alive. I  am a leJ oI  the
death triSod that will destroy our Ioes.”
   Silence settled over them.
   Paul Jlanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond StilJar,
the way they stood without movinJ Ior this moment oI Sersonal Srayer. And
he thouJht oI  how  the Fremen were  a SeoSle whose livinJ  consisted oI
killinJ,  an entire SeoSle who had lived with raJe and JrieI all oI their days,
never once considerinJ what miJht  take the Slace oI either—e[ceSt  Ior a
dream with which Liet-Kynes had inIused them beIore his death.
   “Where  is the Lord  who led us throuJh  the land oI  desert and oI Sits?”
StilJar asked.
   “He  is ever with us,” the Fremen chanted.
   StilJar  sTuared his  shoulders, steSSed closer to Paul and  lowered his
voice. “Now,   remember what  I  told  you.  Do  it  simSly  and directly   —
nothinJ Iancy. AmonJ  our SeoSle, we ride the maker at the aJe oI twelve.
You are more than si[ years beyond that aJe and not born to this liIe.  You

435
don’t have to imSress anyone with your couraJe. We know you are brave.
All you must do is call the maker and ride him.”
   “I  will  remember,” Paul said.
   “See that you do. I’ll  not have you shame my teachinJ.”
   StilJar  Sulled a Slastic rod about a meter lonJ Irom beneath his robe. The
thinJ was Sointed at one end, had a sSrinJ-wound claSSer at the other end.
“I SreSared this thumSer myselI. It’s a Jood one. Take it.”
   Paul Ielt the warm smoothness oI the Slastic as he acceSted the thumSer.
   “Shishakli  has your hooks,” StilJar said. “He’ll  hand them to you as you
steS out onto that  dune over there.”  He Sointed to  his riJht.  “Call   a biJ
maker, Usul. Show us the way.”
   Paul  marked the tone oI  StilJar’s  voice—halI  ritual  and halI  that oI  a
worried Iriend.
   In  that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took
on the silvered Jray-blue that warned this would  be a day oI e[treme  heat
and dryness even Ior Arrakis.
   “It   is the time oI  the scaldinJ day,” StilJar  said, and now his voice was
entirely ritual. “Go,  Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a leader oI
men.”
   Paul saluted his banner, notinJ how the Jreen and black IlaJ hunJ limSly
now that the dawn wind  had died. He turned  toward the dune StilJar had
indicated—a dirty  tan sloSe with  an S  -track crest. Already,  most oI  the
trooS was movinJ out in the oSSosite direction, climbinJ the other dune that
had sheltered their camS.
   One robed IiJure remained in Paul’s Sath: Shishakli, a sTuad leader oI the
Fedaykin, only his sloSe-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit caS and mask.
   Shishakli  Sresented two thin,  whiSlike shaIts as  Paul aSSroached. The
shaIts were about a meter and a halI lonJ with JlisteninJ  Slasteel hoods at
one end, rouJhened at the other end Ior a Iirm JriS.
   Paul acceSted them both in his leIt hand as reTuired by the ritual.
   “They  are my own hooks,” Shishakli  said in a husky voice. “They never
have Iailed.”
   Paul nodded, maintaininJ the necessary silence, moved Sast the man and
uS the dune sloSe. At the crest, he Jlanced back, saw the trooS scatterinJ
like a  IliJht  oI  insects, their robes IlutterinJ.  He  stood alone now  on the
sandy ridJe with  only  the horizon in  Iront  oI him,  the Ilat  and unmovinJ

436
horizon.  This   was  a  Jood  dune  StilJar   had  chosen,  hiJher  than  its
comSanions Ior the viewSoint vantaJe.
   StooSinJ, Paul Slanted the thumSer deeS into the windward Iace where
the sand was  comSacted and would  Jive  ma[imum  transmission  to the
drumminJ. Then he hesitated, reviewinJ the lessons, reviewinJ the liIe-and-
death necessities that Iaced him.
   When he threw the latch, the thumSer would beJin its summons. Across
the sand, a Jiant worm—a maker—would hear and come to the drumminJ.
With the whiSlike hook-staIIs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker’s hiJh
curvinJ back. For as lonJ as a Iorward edJe oI a worm’s rinJ seJment was
held oSen by a hook, oSen to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive
interior, the creature would not retreat beneath the desert. It would, in Iact,
roll  its JiJantic  body  to brinJ  the  oSened seJment as Iar away Irom  the
desert surIace as Sossible.
   I  am a sandrider, Paul told himselI.
   He Jlanced down at the hooks in his leIt  hand, thinkinJ that he had only
to shiIt those hooks down the curve oI a maker’s immense side to make the
creature roll and turn, JuidinJ  it where he willed.  He had seen it done. He
had been helSed uS the side oI  a worm  Ior  a short ride  in  traininJ. The
caStive worm could be ridden until it lay e[hausted and Tuiescent uSon the
desert surIace and a new maker must be summoned.
   Once  he was Sast this  test, Paul knew,  he was  TualiIied to  make the
twenty-thumSer Mourney into the southland—to rest and restore himselI—
into the south where the women and the Iamilies had been hidden Irom the
SoJrom amonJ the new Salmaries and sietch warrens.
   He  liIted  his head and looked  to the south, remindinJ  himselI  that the
maker summoned wild Irom the erJ was an unknown Tuantity, and the one
who summoned it was eTually unknown to this test.
   “You    must  JauJe   the   aSSroachinJ maker   careIully,”   StilJar    had
e[Slained. “You must stand close enouJh that you can mount it as it Sasses,
yet not so close that it enJulIs you.”
   With   abruSt decision, Paul  released the thumSer’s latch.  The  claSSer
beJan revolvinJ and the summons drummed throuJh the sand, a measured
“lumS… lumS… lumS ….”
   He  straiJhtened,  scanninJ the  horizon,  rememberinJ StilJar’s   words:
“JudJe the line oI aSSroach careIully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an

437
unseen aSSroach to a thumSer. Listen all the same. You may oIten hear it
beIore you see it.”
   And  Chani’s words oI caution, whisSered at niJht when her Iear Ior him
overcame her,  Iilled  his  mind:   “When  you  take  your  stand  alonJ  the
maker’s Sath, you must remain utterly still. You must think  like  a Satch oI
sand. Hide  beneath your  cloak  and become  a little   dune in   your  very
essence.”
   Slowly,  he scanned the horizon, listeninJ, watchinJ Ior the siJns he had
been tauJht.
   It  came Irom the southeast, a distant hissinJ, a sand-whisSer. Presently he
saw the Iaraway outline  oI the  creature’s track aJainst the dawnliJht  and
realized he had never beIore seen a maker this larJe, never heard oI one this
size. It  aSSeared to be more than halI a  leaJue lonJ, and  the rise oI  the
sandwave at its crestinJ head was like the aSSroach oI a mountain.
   This  is nothing I  have seen by vision or in  life,  Paul cautioned himselI.
He hurried across the Sath oI the thinJ to take his stand, cauJht uS entirely
by the rushinJ needs oI this moment.

438
        “Control  the coinage and the courts —letthe rabble have the rest.” Thus the Padishah
        Emperor advised you. And he tells you: “If you want profits, you must rule.” There is truth in
        these words, but I ask myself: “Who are the rabble and who are the ruled?”
—Muad’Dib’s Secret MessaJe to the Landsraad from “Arrakis AwakeninJ” by the Princess Irulan



 
A  THOUGHT      came  unbidden   to   Jessica’s  mind:   Paul   will    be  undergoing
his sandrider    test  at any  moment   now.  They try   to conceal   this  fact  from   me,
but it’s  obvious.
    And  Chani   has gone  on  some mysterious   errand.
    Jessica  sat  in  her  restinJ    chamber,   catchinJ   a  moment   oI  Tuiet   between
the niJht’s   classes.  It  was  a Sleasant  chamber,  but  not  as larJe  as the  one  she
had  enMoyed in  Sietch   Tabr  beIore   their   IliJht    Irom   the  SoJrom.    Still,   this
Slace  had  thick   ruJs  on  the  Iloor,   soIt   cushions,   a  low   coIIee   table  near  at
hand,   multicolored      hanJinJs    on   the   walls,    and   soIt   yellow     JlowJlobes
overhead.  The   room  was  Sermeated   with   the  distinctive    acrid   Iurry   odor  oI
a Fremen  sietch  that  she had  come  to  associate  with   a sense oI  security.
    Yet  she  knew   she  would   never   overcome    a IeelinJ    oI  beinJ   in   an  alien
Slace. It  was  the harshness  that  the  ruJs  and  hanJinJs   attemSted  to  conceal.
    A   Iaint   tinklinJ-drumminJ-slaSSinJ          Senetrated   to   the  restinJ    chamber.
Jessica  knew   it   Ior   a  birth   celebration,     Srobably   Subiay’s.    Her   time   was
near.  And    Jessica   knew   she’d    see  the   baby   soon   enouJh—a     blue-eyed
cherub  brouJht   to  the Reverend   Mother   Ior   blessinJ.   She knew   also  that  her
dauJhter,  Alia,   would   be  at the  celebration   and  would   reSort  on it.
    It  was  not  yet  time   Ior  the  niJhtly    Srayer  oI  SartinJ.   They   wouldn’t    have
started  a birth   celebration   near  the  time  oI  ceremony   that  mourned   the  slave
raids  oI Poritrin,    Bela  TeJeuse,  Rossak,   and HarmontheS.
    Jessica  siJhed.   She knew   she was  tryinJ    to keeS  her  thouJhts   oII   her son
and  the   danJers   he   Iaced—the     Sit  traSs   with    their   Soisoned    barbs,   the
Harkonnen    raids  (althouJh    these   were  JrowinJ     Iewer   as the   Fremen   took
their  toll  oI  aircraIt   and  raiders  with   the  new  weaSons  Paul  had Jiven   them),
and the  natural  danJers   oI the  desert—makers    and  thirst  and  dust  chasms.
    She  thouJht    oI  callinJ    Ior   coIIee   and  with    the  thouJht   came   that  ever-
Sresent  awareness   oI   Sarado[    in  the   Fremen   way   oI   liIe:   how   well    they
lived  in  these  sietch   caverns  comSared   to  the Jraben   Syons;  yet,  how   much

439
more  they  endured in   the  oSen haMr oI  the  desert than  anythinJ  the
Harkonnen bondsmen endured.
   A  dark hand inserted itselI throuJh the hanJinJs beside her, deSosited a
cuS uSon the table and withdrew. From the cuS arose the aroma oI sSiced
coIIee.
   An offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thouJht.
   She took the coIIee and siSSed it, smilinJ at herselI. In what other society
of our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an
anonymous drink  and Tuaff  that  drink  without   fear? I   could  alter  any
poison now before it did me harm, of course, but the donor doesn’t realize
this.
   She drained the cuS, IeelinJ the enerJy and liIt  oI its  contents—hot and
delicious.
   And  she wondered what other society would have such a natural reJard
Ior her  Srivacy and comIort  that the Jiver  would  intrude  only enouJh  to
deSosit the JiIt  and not inIlict   her with  the donor? ResSect and love had
sent the JiIt—with only a sliJht tinJe oI Iear.
   Another  element oI the incident Iorced itselI into her awareness: she had
thouJht oI coIIee and it had aSSeared. There was nothinJ oI teleSathy here,
she knew.   It   was  the  tau,  the   oneness oI  the   sietch  community,  a
comSensation Irom the subtle Soison oI the sSice diet they shared. The Jreat
mass oI the SeoSle could never hoSe to attain the enliJhtenment the sSice
seed brouJht to her; they  had not been trained and SreSared Ior it.  Their
minds reMected what they could not understand or encomSass. Still they Ielt
and reacted sometimes like a sinJle orJanism.
   And  the thouJht oI coincidence never entered their minds.
   Has  Paul   passed his  test  on  the  sand? Jessica asked  herselI.  He’s
capable, but accident can strike down even the most capable.
   The waitinJ.
   It’s  the  dreariness, she thouJht.  You can  wait  just  so long.  Then the
dreariness of the waiting overcomes you.
   There was all manner oI waitinJ in their lives.
   More  than  two  years  we’ve  been here,  she thouJht,  and  twice  that
number at least to go before we can even hope to think  of trying  to wrest
Arrakis from the Harkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.
   “Reverend Mother?”

440
   The voice  Irom outside the hanJinJs at her  door was that oI Harah, the
other woman in Paul’s menaJe.
   “Yes, Harah.”
   The hanJinJs Sarted and Harah seemed to Jlide throuJh them. She wore
sietch sandals, a red-yellow wraSaround that e[Sosed her arms almost to the
shoulders. Her black hair was Sarted in the middle and sweSt back like the
winJs oI  an insect, Ilat  and  oily  aJainst her head. The MuttinJ, Sredatory
Ieatures were drawn into an intense Irown.
   Behind Harah came Alia, a Jirl-child oI  about two years.
   SeeinJ her dauJhter, Jessica was cauJht as she IreTuently was by Alia’s
resemblance to Paul at  that  aJe—the same wide-eyed  solemnity  to  her
TuestinJ look, the dark hair  and Iirmness oI mouth. But  there were subtle
diIIerences, too, and it was in these that most adults Iound Alia disTuietinJ.
The child—little  more than a toddler—carried herselI with  a calmness and
awareness beyond her years. Adults were shocked to Iind her lauJhinJ at a
subtle Slay  oI   words  between  the  se[es.  Or  they’d   catch themselves
listeninJ to her halI-lisSinJ voice, still blurred as it was by an unIormed soIt
Salate, and discover in her words sly remarks that could only be based on
e[Seriences no two-year-old had ever encountered.
   Harah sank to a cushion with an e[asSerated siJh, Irowned at the child.
   “Alia.”   Jessica motioned to her dauJhter.
   The child  crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasSed
her mother’s hand. The contact oI Ilesh restored that mutual awareness they
had shared since beIore Alia’s birth. It wasn’t a matter oI shared thouJhts—
althouJh  there were  bursts  oI  that  iI   they  touched  while  Jessica was
chanJinJ the  sSice Soison Ior  a  ceremony. It  was somethinJ  larJer,  an
immediate awareness oI another livinJ sSark, a sharS and SoiJnant thinJ, a
nerve-sympatico that made them emotionally one.
   In  the  Iormal  manner that beIitted  a  member oI  her son’s  household,
Jessica said: “Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This niJht Iinds you well?”
   With  the same traditional Iormality, she said: “Subakh un nar. I am well.”
The words were almost toneless. AJain, she siJhed.
   Jessica sensed amusement Irom Alia.
   “My  brother’s Jhanima is annoyed with me,” Alia said in her halI-lisS.
   Jessica marked the term  Alia  used to reIer  to Harah—Jhanima. In  the
subtleties oI the  Fremen tonJue, the word  meant “somethinJ acTuired in

441
battle” and with the added overtone that the somethinJ no lonJer was used
Ior its oriJinal SurSose. An ornament, a sSearhead used as a curtain weiJht.
   Harah  scowled at the child.  “Don’t   try to  insult  me, child.  I know  my
Slace.”
   “What  have you done this time, Alia?” Jessica asked.
   Harah  answered: “Not   only   has she  reIused to  Slay  with   the other
children today, but she intruded where ….”
   “I  hid  behind the hanJinJs and watched Subiay’s child beinJ born,” Alia
said. “It’s a boy. He cried and cried. What a set oI  lunJs! When he’d cried
lonJ enouJh—”
   “She  came out and touched him,”  Harah said, “and  he stoSSed cryinJ.
Everyone knows a Fremen baby must Jet his cryinJ done at birth, iI he’s in
sietch because he can never cry aJain lest he betray us on haMr.”
   “He’d  cried  enouJh,” Alia  said. “I Must wanted to Ieel his sSark, his liIe.
That’s all. And when he Ielt me he didn’t want to cry anymore.”
   “It’s  Must made more talk amonJ the SeoSle,” Harah said.
   “Subiay’s  boy  is healthy?”  Jessica asked. She saw that somethinJ was
troublinJ Harah deeSly and wondered at it.
   “Healthy  as any mother could ask,” Harah said. “They know  Alia didn’t
hurt him.  They didn’t  so  much mind  her touchinJ  him. He  settled down
riJht away and was haSSy. I was ….” Harah shruJJed.
   “It’s   the stranJeness oI my dauJhter, is that it?”  Jessica asked. “It’s the
way she sSeaks oI thinJs beyond her years and oI thinJs no child  her aJe
could know—thinJs oI the Sast.”
   “How  could she know what a child looked like on Bela TeJeuse?” Harah
demanded.
   “But  he does!” Alia  said, “Subiay’s  boy looks Must like the son oI Mitha
born beIore the SartinJ.”
   “Alia!”   Jessica said. “I warned you.”
   “But,  Mother, I saw it and it was true and ….”
   Jessica shook her head, seeinJ the siJns oI disturbance in Harah’s Iace.
What have I borne?  Jessica asked herselI. A daughter who knew at birth
everything that I  knew … and more: everything revealed to her out  of the
corridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.
   “It’s  not Must the thinJs she says,” Harah said. “It’s the e[ercises, too: the
way she sits and stares at a rock, movinJ only one muscle beside her nose,
or a muscle on the back oI a IinJer, or—”

442
   “Those  are the  Bene Gesserit traininJ,”  Jessica said. “You  know  that,
Harah. Would you deny my dauJhter her inheritance?”
   “Reverend  Mother, you  know these thinJs  don’t  matter to me,”  Harah
said. “It’s the SeoSle and the way they mutter. I Ieel danJer in it. They say
your dauJhter’s a demon, that other  children reIuse to Slay with  her, that
she’s—”
   “She  has so  little   in  common with   the  other children,”   Jessica said.
“She’s no demon. It’s Must the—”
   “OI  course she’s not!”
   Jessica Iound herselI surSrised at the vehemence in Harah’s tone, Jlanced
down at Alia.  The child  aSSeared lost in thouJht, radiatinJ  a sense oI …
waitinJ. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.
   “I  resSect the Iact that you’re a member oI my son’s household,” Jessica
said. (Alia  stirred aJainst her  hand.) “You  may sSeak oSenly with me  oI
whatever’s troublinJ you.”
   “I   will  not be  a member oI your  son’s household much lonJer,”  Harah
said. “I’ve waited this lonJ Ior  the sake oI my sons, the sSecial traininJ they
receive as the children oI Usul. It’s little enouJh I could Jive them since it’s
known I don’t share your son’s bed.”
   AJain  Alia stirred beside her, halI-sleeSinJ, warm.
   “You’d  have made a Jood comSanion Ior my son, thouJh,” Jessica said.
And  she added  to  herselI  because such thouJhts  were  ever  with  her:
Companion … not a wife. Jessica’s thouJhts went then straiJht to the center,
to the SanJ that  came Irom the  common talk in  the  sietch that her son’s
comSanionshiS with Chani had become a Sermanent thinJ, the marriaJe.
   I  love Chani,  Jessica thouJht, but she reminded herselI that love miJht
have to steS aside Ior royal  necessity. Royal marriaJes had other reasons
than love.
   “You  think I don’t know  what you Slan Ior your son?” Harah asked.
   “What  do you mean?” Jessica demanded.
   “You  Slan to unite the tribes under Him,” Harah said.
   “Is  that bad?”
   “I  see danJer Ior him … and Alia is Sart oI that danJer.”
   Alia  nestled closer to her mother, eyes oSened now and studyinJ Harah.
   “I’ve   watched you two toJether,”  Harah said, “the way  you touch. And
Alia is like  my own Ilesh because she’s sister to one who is like my brother.
I’ve watched over her and Juarded her Irom the time she was a mere baby,

443
Irom the time oI the razzia when we Iled here. I’ve seen many thinJs about
her.”
   Jessica nodded, IeelinJ disTuiet beJin to Jrow in Alia beside her.
   “You  know what I  mean,” Harah said. “The way she knew Irom the Iirst
what we were sayinJ to her. When has there been another baby who knew
the water disciSline so younJ? What other baby’s Iirst  words to  her nurse
were: ‘I love you, Harah’?”
   Harah  stared at Alia.  “Why  do  you think  I  acceSt her insults? I know
there’s no malice in them.”
   Alia  looked uS at her mother.
   “Yes,  I have reasoninJ Sowers, Reverend Mother,” Harah said. “I could
have been oI the Sayyadina. I have seen what I have seen.”
   “Harah….”   Jessica shruJJed. “I don’t  know what to  say.” And  she Ielt
surSrise at herselI, because this literally was true.
   Alia  straiJhtened, sTuared her shoulders. Jessica Ielt the sense oI waitinJ
ended, an emotion comSounded oI decision and sadness.
   “We made a mistake,” Alia said. “Now we need Harah.”
   “It   was the ceremony oI the seed,” Harah said, “when you  chanJed the
Water oI LiIe, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you.”
   Need Harah? Jessica asked herselI.
   “Who  else can talk amonJ the SeoSle and make them beJin to understand
me?” Alia asked.
   “What  would you have her do?” Jessica asked.
   “She already knows what to do,” Alia said.
   “I  will  tell them the truth,” Harah said. Her Iace seemed suddenly old and
sad with its olive  skin drawn  into Irown  wrinkles,  a witchery in  the sharS
Ieatures. “I will  tell  them that Alia only  Sretends to be a little Jirl, that she
has never been a little Jirl.”
   Alia   shook her head. Tears ran  down her  cheeks, and Jessica Ielt the
wave oI sadness Irom her dauJhter as thouJh the emotion were her own.
   “I  know I’m  a Ireak,” Alia  whisSered. The adult summation cominJ Irom
the child mouth was like a bitter conIirmation.
   “You’re  not a Ireak!” Harah snaSSed. “Who dared say you’re a Ireak?”
   AJain,  Jessica marveled at the Iierce  note oI Srotectiveness in Harah’s
voice. Jessica saw  then that  Alia   had MudJed correctly—they did  need
Harah.  The  tribe   would  understand  Harah—both  her  words   and  her

444
emotions—Ior it  was obvious she loved Alia  as thouJh this were her own
child.
   “Who  said it?” Harah reSeated.
   “Nobody.”
   Alia  used a corner oI  Jessica’s aba to wiSe the tears Irom her Iace. She
smoothed the robe where she had damSened and crumSled it.
   “Then  don’t you say it,” Harah ordered.
   “Yes, Harah.”
   “Now,”   Harah said, “you may tell  me what it was like  so that I may tell
the others. Tell me what it is that haSSened to you.”
   Alia  swallowed, looked uS at her mother.
   Jessica nodded.
   “One  day I  woke uS,” Alia  said. “It  was like  wakinJ  Irom sleeS e[ceSt
that I could not remember JoinJ to sleeS. I was in a warm, dark Slace. And
I was IriJhtened.”
   ListeninJ  to  the halI-lisSinJ  voice oI  her dauJhter, Jessica remembered
that day in the biJ cavern.
   “When  I was IriJhtened,”  Alia  said, “I  tried to escaSe, but there was no
way to escaSe. Then I saw a sSark … but it  wasn’t e[actly  like  seeinJ it.
The sSark was Must there with me and I Ielt the sSark’s emotions … soothinJ
me, comIortinJ me, tellinJ  me that way that everythinJ would  be all riJht.
That was my mother.”
   Harah rubbed at  her eyes, smiled reassurinJly at  Alia.  Yet there was a
look oI  wildness in the eyes oI the Fremen woman, an intensity as thouJh
they, too, were tryinJ to hear Alia’s words.
   And  Jessica thouJht: What do we really know of how such a one thinks …
out of her uniTue experiences and training and ancestry?
   “Just when I  Ielt saIe and reassured,” Alia said, “there was another sSark
with us … and everythinJ was haSSeninJ at once. The other sSark was the
old  Reverend Mother.   She was  …   tradinJ  lives   with  my   mother  …
everythinJ … and I was there with them, seeinJ it all … everythinJ. And  it
was over, and I was them and all the others and myselI … only it took me a
lonJ time to Iind myselI aJain. There were so many others.”
   “It    was  a  cruel  thinJ,”   Jessica said.  “No   beinJ   should  wake  into
consciousness thus. The wonder oI it is you could acceSt all that haSSened
to you.”

445
   “I  couldn’t  do anythinJ else!”  Alia  said. “I didn’t  know  how to reMect or
hide my  consciousness … or shut it  oII  …  everythinJ  Must haSSened …
everythinJ ….”
   “We  didn’t  know,”  Harah murmured. “When  we Jave  your mother the
Water to chanJe, we didn’t know you e[isted within her.”
   “Don’t   be  sad about it,  Harah,”  Alia  said.  “I  shouldn’t  Ieel  sorry Ior
myselI. AIter all,  there’s cause Ior haSSiness here: I’m a Reverend Mother.
The tribe has two Rev ….”
   She broke oII, tiSSinJ her head to listen.
   Harah rocked back on her heels aJainst the sittinJ cushion, stared at Alia,
brinJinJ her attention then uS to Jessica’s Iace.
   “Didn’t   you susSect?” Jessica asked.
   “Sh-h-h-h,”  Alia  said.
   A   distant rhythmic  chantinJ  came to  them throuJh  the  hanJinJs that
seSarated them Irom the sietch corridors. It Jrew  louder, carryinJ  distinct
sounds now: “Ya!Ya!  Yawm!  Ya!  Ya! Yawm!  Mu  zein,  wallah!  Ya!  Ya!
Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!”
   The chanters Sassed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed throuJh
to the inner aSartments. Slowly the sound receded.
   When  the sound had dimmed  suIIiciently,  Jessica beJan the ritual, the
sadness in her voice: “It was Ramadhan and ASril on Bela TeJeuse.”
   “My  Iamily  sat in their Sool courtyard,” Harah said, “in air bathed by the
moisture that  arose Irom  the  sSray oI  a  Iountain.  There was  a tree  oI
SortyJuls, round and deeS in color, near at hand. There was a basket with
mish mish and baklawa and muJs oI  liban—all  manner oI Jood  thinJs to
eat. In our Jardens and in our  Ilocks, there was Seace … Seace in all the
land.”
   “LiIe  was Iull  with haSSiness until the raiders came,” Alia said.
   “Blood  ran cold  at the scream oI Iriends,” Jessica said. And she Ielt the
memories rushinJ throuJh her out oI all those other Sasts she shared.
   “La,  la, la, the women cried,” said Harah.
   “The  raiders came throuJh the mushtamal, rushinJ at us with their knives
driSSinJ red Irom the lives oI our men,” Jessica said.
   Silence came over the three oI them as it was in all the aSartments oI the
sietch, the silence while they remembered and keSt their JrieI thus Iresh.
   Presently, Harah uttered  the ritual  endinJ  to the  ceremony, JivinJ  the
words a harshness that Jessica had never beIore heard in them.

446
   “We will  never IorJive and we will  never IorJet,” Harah said.
   In  the thouJhtIul Tuiet that Iollowed her words, they heard a mutterinJ oI
SeoSle, the swish oI many robes. Jessica sensed someone standinJ beyond
the hanJinJs that shielded her chamber.
   “Reverend Mother?”
   A  woman’s voice, and Jessica recoJnized it: the voice oI Tharthar, one oI
StilJar’s wives.
   “What  is it, Tharthar?”
   “There is trouble, Reverend Mother.”
   Jessica Ielt a constriction at her heart, an abruSt Iear Ior Paul. “Paul …”
she JasSed.
   Tharthar sSread the hanJinJs, steSSed into the chamber. Jessica JlimSsed
a Sress oI SeoSle in the outer room beIore the hanJinJs Iell. She looked uS
at Tharthar—a small, dark woman in a red-IiJured  robe oI black, the total
blue oI  her eyes trained  Ii[edly   on Jessica, the nostrils  oI her  tiny  nose
dilated to reveal the SluJ scars.
   “What  is it?” Jessica demanded.
   “There  is word Irom the sand,” Tharthar said. “Usul meets the maker Ior
his test …  it  is  today. The  younJ  men say he  cannot Iail,  he will   be a
sandrider by niJhtIall.  The younJ men are bandinJ Ior  a razzia. They will
raid in the north and meet Usul there. They say they will raise the cry then.
They say they will Iorce him to call out StilJar and assume command oI the
tribes.”
   Gathering  water, planting  the  dunes, changing their  world  slowly  but
surely—these are no longer enough, Jessica thought. The little  raids,  the
certain raids—these are no longer enough now that Paul and I have trained
them. They feel their power. They want to fight.
   Tharthar shiIted Irom one Ioot to the other, cleared her throat.
   We know the need for  cautious waiting,  Jessica thouJht, but there’s the
core of our  frustration. We know also the  harm that waiting  extended too
long can do us. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting’s prolonged.
   “The  younJ  men say iI  Usul does not call  out StilJar,  then he must be
aIraid,” Tharthar said.
   She lowered her Jaze.
   “So  that’s the way oI it,” Jessica muttered. And she thouJht: Well I saw it
coming. As did Stilgar.

447
   AJain,  Tharthar  cleared her throat. “Even  my  brother, Shoab, says it,”
she said. “They will leave Usul no choice.”
   Then  it  has  come, Jessica thouJht.  And Paul   will  have  to  handle it
himself. The Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.
   Alia  Ireed her hand Irom her mother’s, said: “I will  Jo with  Tharthar and
listen to the younJ men. PerhaSs there is a way.”
   Jessica met Tharthar’s Jaze, but sSoke to Alia: “Go, then. And  reSort to
me as soon as you can.”
   “We do not want this thinJ to haSSen, Reverend Mother,” Tharthar said.
   “We  do not  want it,”  Jessica aJreed. “The tribe  needs all its strenJth.”
She Jlanced at Harah. “Will you Jo with them?”
   Harah answered the unsSoken Sart oI the Tuestion: “Tharthar will allow
no harm to beIall Alia.  She knows we will soon be wives toJether, she and
I, to share the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and I.” Harah looked uS
at Tharthar, back to Jessica. “We have an understandinJ.”
   Tharthar held out a hand Ior Alia,  said: “We must hurry. The younJ men
are leavinJ.”
   They   Sressed throuJh  the  hanJinJs,  the  child’s   hand  in  the   small
woman’s hand, but the child seemed to be leadinJ.
   “II  Paul-Muad’Dib  slays StilJar, this will  not serve the tribe,” Harah said.
“Always   beIore,  it   has been  the  way  oI   succession, but  times   have
chanJed.”
   “Times  have chanJed Ior you, as well,” Jessica said.
   “You  cannot think  I  doubt  the outcome oI  such a  battle,” Harah  said.
“Usul could not but win.”
   “That  was my meaninJ,” Jessica said.
   “And   you think  my  Sersonal IeelinJs enter into  my  MudJment,” Harah
said. She shook her head, her water rinJs tinklinJ at her neck. “How wronJ
you are. PerhaSs you think, as well,  that I  reJret not beinJ  the chosen oI
Usul, that I am Mealous oI Chani?”
   “You  make your own choice as you are able,” Jessica said.
   “I  Sity Chani,” Harah said.
   Jessica stiIIened. “What do you mean?”
   “I  know  what you think oI  Chani,” Harah said. “You think she is not the
wiIe Ior your son.”
   Jessica settled back, rela[ed on her cushions. She shruJJed. “PerhaSs.”

   “You  could be riJht,”  Harah said. “II  you are, you may Iind  a surSrisinJ
ally—Chani herselI. She wants whatever is best Ior Him.”
   Jessica swallowed Sast a sudden tiJhteninJ in her throat. “Chani’s  very
dear to me,” she said. “She could be no—”
   “Your  ruJs are very dirty in here,” Harah said. She sweSt her Jaze around
the Iloor, avoidinJ  Jessica’s eyes. “So many SeoSle tramSinJ throuJh here
all the time. You really should have them cleaned more oIten.”

        You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle
        permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this
        pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal Tuestion:
        to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing
        themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.
                                              —from “Muad’Dib: The ReliJious Issues” by the Princess Irulan



 
P AUL  WAITED    on  the sand  outside  the  JiJantic   maker’s   line   oI  aSSroach. I
must   not    wait    like    a   smuggler—impatient       and    jittering,      he   reminded
himselI.   I must  be  part  of  the desert.
    The   thinJ    was   only   minutes    away   now,   IillinJ      the  morninJ     with    the
Iriction-hissinJ      oI  its  SassaJe.  Its  Jreat  teeth  within    the  cavern-circle     oI  its
mouth  sSread  like  some  enormous   Ilower.   The  sSice  odor  Irom  it  dominated
the air.
    Paul’s  stillsuit    rode  easily   on his  body  and  he  was only   distantly   aware   oI
his nose  SluJs,  the  breathinJ   mask.   StilJar’s   teachinJ,   the  SainstakinJ    hours
on the  sand, overshadowed    all  else.
    “How    Iar outside   the  maker’s   radius  must  you  stand  in  Sea sand?”   StilJar
had asked  him.
    And   he  had   answered   correctly:     “HalI    a  meter   Ior   every   meter   oI   the
maker’s  diameter.”
    “Why?”
    “To   avoid    the  vorte[     oI  its   SassaJe  and   still   have   time   to   run  in   and
mount  it.”
    “You’ve    ridden   the   little   ones  bred  Ior   the  seed  and  the  Water   oI  LiIe,”
StilJar   had  said.  “But   what  you’ll    summon   Ior  your   test is  a wild   maker,   an
old  man oI  the  desert.  You  must  have  SroSer resSect  Ior  such  a one.”
    Now    the    thumSer’s     deeS   drumminJ      blended    with     the   hiss   oI    the
aSSroachinJ   worm.    Paul   breathed    deeSly,   smellinJ    mineral    bitterness    oI
sand  even  throuJh    his  Iilters.    The  wild    maker,   the  old   man  oI   the  desert,
loomed   almost   on  him.   Its  crestinJ    Iront   seJments   threw   a  sandwave   that
would  sweeS  across  his  knees.
    Come  up,  you  lovely  monster,   he thouJht.   Up.   You hear  me  calling.   Come
up. Come  up.

450
   The  wave liIted   his Ieet.  SurIace dust sweSt across him.  He  steadied
himselI, his world  dominated by the SassaJe oI that sand-clouded curvinJ
wall, that seJmented cliII, the rinJ lines sharSly deIined in it.
   Paul liIted  his hooks, siJhted alonJ them, leaned in. He Ielt them bite and
Sull. He  leaSed uSward, SlantinJ his  Ieet  aJainst that  wall,  leaninJ  out
aJainst the clinJinJ barbs. This was the true instant oI the testinJ: iI he had
Slanted the hooks correctly at the leadinJ edJe oI a rinJ seJment, oSeninJ
the seJment, the worm would not roll down and crush him.
   The  worm slowed. It  Jlided  across the thumSer, silencinJ it.  Slowly, it
beJan to roll—uS,  uS—brinJinJ  those irritant  barbs as  hiJh as  Sossible,
away Irom   the  sand that  threatened the  soIt  inner  laSSinJ oI  its   rinJ
seJment.
   Paul Iound himselI ridinJ  uSriJht atoS the worm. He Ielt e[ultant, like an
emSeror surveyinJ his world. He suSSressed a sudden urJe to cavort there,
to turn the worm, to show oII his mastery oI this creature.
   Suddenly he understood why  StilJar had warned him  once about brash
younJ men who danced and Slayed with these monsters, doinJ handstands
on their backs, removinJ both hooks and reSlantinJ them beIore the worm
could sSill them.
   LeavinJ  one hook in  Slace, Paul released the other and Slanted it lower
down the side. When the second hook was Iirm and tested, he brouJht down
the Iirst one, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and as
it rolled, it  turned, cominJ around the sweeS oI Ilour sand where the others
waited.
   Paul  saw them come uS, usinJ  their  hooks to  climb, but  avoidinJ  the
sensitive rinJ edJes until they were on toS. They rode at last in a triSle line
behind him, steadied aJainst their hooks.
   StilJar  moved uS  throuJh the ranks, checked the  SositioninJ oI  Paul’s
hooks, Jlanced uS at Paul’s smilinJ Iace.
   “You  did it,  eh?” StilJar  asked, raisinJ his voice above the hiss oI their
SassaJe. “That’s what you think? You did it?” He straiJhtened. “Now I  tell
you that was a very  sloSSy Mob. We have twelve-year-olds who do better.
There was drumsand to your leIt where you  waited. You could not  retreat
there iI the worm turned that way.”
   The smile sliSSed Irom Paul’s Iace. “I saw the drumsand.”
   “Then  why did you not siJnal Ior one oI us to take uS Sosition secondary
to you? It was a thinJ you could do even in the test.”

451
   Paul swallowed, Iaced into the wind oI their SassaJe.
   “You  think  it bad oI  me to say this  now,” StilJar  said. “It  is my  duty. I
think oI  your worth  to the trooS. II  you had stumbled into  that drumsand,
the maker would’ve turned toward you.”
   In  sSite oI a surJe oI anJer, Paul knew that StilJar sSoke the truth. It took
a lonJ minute  and the Iull  eIIort  oI the traininJ  he had received Irom  his
mother Ior Paul to  recaSture a IeelinJ oI calm.  “I  aSoloJize,” he said. “It
will not haSSen aJain.”
   “In  a tiJht  Sosition, always leave yourselI a secondary, someone to take
the maker iI you  cannot,” StilJar  said. “Remember that we work toJether.
That way, we’re certain. We work toJether, eh?”
   He slaSSed Paul’s shoulder.
   “We work  toJether,” Paul aJreed.
   “Now,”   StilJar said, and his voice was harsh, “show me you  know how
to handle a maker. Which side are we on?”
   Paul Jlanced down at the scaled rinJ surIace on which they stood, noted
the character and size oI the scales, the way they Jrew larJer oII to his riJht,
smaller to his leIt. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one
side uS more IreTuently. As it Jrew older, the characteristic uS-side became
an almost constant thinJ. Bottom scales Jrew larJer, heavier, smoother. ToS
scales could be told by size alone on a biJ worm.
   ShiItinJ  his hooks, Paul moved to the leIt. He motioned Ilankers down to
oSen seJments alonJ the side and keeS the worm on a straiJht course as it
rolled. When he had it  turned, he motioned two  steersmen out oI the line
and into Sositions ahead.
   “Ach,   haiiiii-yoh!”     he  shouted in   the  traditional  call.   The  leIt-side
steersman oSened a rinJ seJment there.
   In  a maMestic circle, the maker turned to Srotect its oSened seJment. Full
around it came and when it  was headed back to the  south, Paul shouted:
“Geyrat!”
   The  steersman released his hook.  The  maker  lined  out  in  a  straiJht
course.
   StilJar  said. “Very  Jood,  Paul Muad’Dib.  With  Slenty oI  Sractice, you
may yet become a sandrider.”
   Paul Irowned, thinkinJ:  Was I notfirst up?
   From behind him  there came sudden lauJhter. The trooS beJan chantinJ,
IlinJinJ  his name aJainst the sky.

452
   “Muad‘Dib!   Muad’Dib!  Muad‘Dib!  Muad’Dib!”
   And  Iar to the rear alonJ  the worm’s surIace, Paul heard the beat oI the
Joaders SoundinJ the tail  seJments. The worm  beJan SickinJ  uS sSeed.
Their  robes IlaSSed in  the  wind.   The abrasive  sound oI  their   SassaJe
increased.
   Paul looked back throuJh the trooS, Iound Chani’s Iace amonJ them. He
looked at her as he sSoke to StilJar. “Then I am a sandrider, Stil?”
   “Hal  yawm! You are a sandrider this day.”
   “Then  I may choose our destination?”
   “That’s  the way oI it.”
   “And  I  am a Fremen born this day here in the Habbanya erJ. I have had
no liIe beIore this day. I was as a child until this day.”
   “Not  Tuite a child,”  StilJar said. He Iastened a corner oI his hood where
the wind was whiSSinJ it.
   “But   there was  a cork  sealinJ oII   my  world,  and that  cork has  been
Sulled.”
   “There is no cork.”
   “I   would Jo  south, StilJar—twenty  thumSers. I would see this land we
make, this land that I’ve only seen throuJh the eyes oI others.”
   And  I would  see my son and my family, he thouJht. I need time now  to
consider the future that is a past within my mind. The turmoil comes and if
I’m not where I can unravel it, the thing will run wild.
   StilJar   looked  at  him  with  a  steady, measurinJ  Jaze. Paul  keSt  his
attention on Chani, seeinJ the interest Tuicken in her Iace, notinJ  also the
e[citement his words had kindled in the trooS.
   “The  men are  eaJer to raid  with  you in  the Harkonnen  sinks,” StilJar
said. “The sinks are only a thumSer away.”
   “The  Fedaykin have raided with  me,”  Paul said. “They’ll   raid with  me
aJain until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.”
   StilJar  studied him  as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeinJ
this moment throuJh the memory oI  how he had risen to command oI  the
Tabr sietch and to leadershiS oI the Council oI Leaders now that Liet-Kynes
was dead.
   He  has  heard  the reports  of  unrest  among the  young  Fremen, Paul
thouJht.
   “Do  you wish a JatherinJ oI the leaders?” StilJar asked.

453
   Eyes blazed amonJ  the younJ men  oI the  trooS. They swayed as they
rode, and they watched. And Paul saw the look oI unrest in Chani’s Jlance,
the way she looked Irom  StilJar, who  was her uncle, to  Paul-Muad’ Dib,
who was her mate.
   “You  cannot Juess what I want,” Paul said.
   And  he  thouJht: I   cannot back down.  I  must hold  control  over  these
people.
   “You  are  mudir oI  the  sandride this day,”  StilJar  said. Cold  Iormality
ranJ in his voice: “How do you use this Sower?”
   We need time to relax, time for cool reflection, Paul thouJht.
   “We shall Jo south,” Paul said.
   “Even  iI I say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over?”
   “We shall Jo south,” Paul reSeated.
   A  sense oI inevitable diJnity enIolded StilJar as he Sulled his robe tiJhtly
around him.   “There  will    be  a  GatherinJ,”  he  said.  “I   will    send the
messaJes.”
   He thinks Iwill  call  him out, Paul thouJht. And he knows he cannot stand
against me.
   Paul Iaced south, IeelinJ the wind aJainst his e[Sosed cheeks, thinkinJ oI
the necessities that went into his decisions.
   They do not know how it is, he thouJht.
   But  he knew he could  not let  any consideration deIlect him. He  had to
remain on the central line oI the time storm he could see in the Iuture. There
would come  an instant when  it  could be  unraveled, but only  iI  he  were
where he could cut the central knot oI it.
   I  will  not call  him out  if it  can be helped, he thought. If there’s another
way to prevent thejihad.…
   “We’ll   camS Ior the eveninJ meal and Srayer at Cave oI  Birds beneath
Habbanya RidJe,” StilJar said. He steadied himselI with  one hook aJainst
the swayinJ oI the maker, Jestured ahead at a low rock barrier risinJ out oI
the desert.
   Paul studied the cliII,  the Jreat streaks oI rock crossinJ it like waves. No
Jreen, no blossom soItened that riJid horizon. Beyond it stretched the way
to the southern desert—a course oI at least ten days and niJhts, as Iast as
they could Joad the makers.
   Twenty thumSers.

454
   The  way led Iar  beyond the Harkonnen Satrols. He knew how it  would
be. The dreams had shown him. One day, as they went, there’d be a Iaint
chanJe oI color on the Iar horizon—such a sliJht chanJe that he miJht Ieel
he was imaJininJ it out oI his hoSes—and there would be the new sietch.
   “Does  my  decision  suit  Muad’Dib?”   StilJar  asked. Only   the Iaintest
touch oI sarcasm tinJed his  voice, but  Fremen ears around them, alert to
every tone in a bird’s cry or  a cielaJo’s SiSinJ messaJe, heard the sarcasm
and watched Paul to see what he would do.
   “StilJar   heard me swear  my loyalty   to him  when  we consecrated the
Fedaykin,” Paul  said. “My   death commandos know  I  sSoke with honor.
Does StilJar doubt it?”
   Real Sain e[Sosed itselI in Paul’s voice. StilJar  heard it and lowered his
Jaze.
   “Usul,  the  comSanion oI my  sietch, him I  would  never doubt,”  StilJar
said. “But  you  are Paul-Muad’Dib,   the Atreides  Duke,  and you  are the
Lisan al-Gaib,  the Voice Irom  the Outer  World. These men I  don’t  even
know.”
   Paul turned away to  watch the Habbanya RidJe climb out oI  the desert.
The maker beneath them still  Ielt stronJ  and willinJ.   It could  carry them
almost twice the distance oI any  other in Fremen e[Serience. He knew it.
There was nothinJ outside the stories told to children that could match this
old man oI the desert. It was the stuII oI a new leJend, Paul realized.
   A  hand JriSSed his shoulder.
   Paul looked at it,  Iollowed  the arm to the Iace beyond it—the dark eyes
oI StilJar e[Sosed between Iilter mask and stillsuit hood.
   “The   one who  led  Tabr sietch beIore  me,”  StilJar  said,  “he  was my
Iriend. We shared danJers. He owed me his liIe many a time … and I owed
him mine.”
   “I  am your Iriend, StilJar,”  Paul said.
   “No  man doubts it,”   StilJar said. He removed his  hand, shruJJed. “It’s
the way.”
   Paul saw that  StilJar was too  immersed in the Fremen way to  consider
the Sossibility  oI  any other. Here  a leader took  the reins  Irom  the dead
hands oI his Sredecessor, or slew amonJ the stronJest oI his tribe iI a leader
died in the desert. StilJar had risen to be a naib in that way.
   “We should leave this maker in deeS sand,” Paul said.
   “Yes,”  StilJar aJreed. “We could walk to the cave Irom here.”

455
   “We’ve  ridden him Iar  enouJh that he’ll bury  himselI and sulk Ior a day
or so,” Paul said.
   “You’re  the mudir  oI the  sandride,” StilJar said. “Say  when we …”  He
broke oII, stared at the eastern sky.
   Paul whirled.  The sSice-blue overcast on his eyes made the sky aSSear
dark, a richly Iiltered  azure aJainst which a distant rhythmic IlashinJ stood
out in sharS contrast.
   OrnithoSter!
   “One small ’thoSter,” StilJar  said.
   “Could  be a scout,” Paul said. “Do you think they’ve seen us.”
   “At   this  distance we’re  Must a worm on the surIace,”  StilJar  said. He
motioned with his leIt hand. “OII. Scatter on the sand.”
   The trooS beJan workinJ down the worm’s sides, droSSinJ oII, blendinJ
with  the sand beneath their  cloaks.  Paul marked  where Chani  droSSed.
Presently, only he and StilJar remained.
   “First  uS, last oII,” Paul said.
   StilJar  nodded, droSSed down the  side on  his hooks,  leaSed onto the
sand. Paul waited until the maker was saIely clear oI the scatter area, then
released his hooks. This was the tricky moment with a worm not comSletely
e[hausted.
   Freed oI  its  Joads and hooks, the biJ  worm  beJan burrowinJ  into  the
sand. Paul ran  liJhtly  back  alonJ  its broad  surIace, MudJed his moment
careIully and leaSed oII. He landed runninJ, lunJed aJainst the sliSIace oI a
dune the way he had been tauJht, and hid himselI  beneath the cascade oI
sand over his robe.
   Now, the waitinJ  ….
   Paul turned, Jently, e[Sosed a crack oI sky beneath a crease in his robe.
He imaJined the others back alonJ their Sath doinJ the same.
   He  heard the beat oI the ’thoSter’s winJs beIore he saw it.  There was a
whisSer oI MetSods and it came over his Satch oI desert, turned in a broad
arc toward the ridJe.
   An  unmarked ’thoSter, Paul noted.
   It  Ilew out oI siJht beyond Habbanya RidJe.
   A  bird cry sounded over the desert. Another.
   Paul shook himselI  Iree oI sand, climbed to  the dune toS. Other IiJures
stood out in a line  trailinJ  away Irom  the ridJe. He recoJnized Chani and
StilJar amonJ them.

456
   StilJar  siJnaled toward the ridJe.
   They  Jathered and beJan  the sandwalk, JlidinJ   over  the surIace in  a
broken rhythm that  would disturb  no maker. StilJar  Saced himselI beside
Paul alonJ the windSacked crest oI a dune.
   “It  was a smuJJler craIt,” StilJar said.
   “So   it   seemed,”  Paul  said.  “But   this   is  deeS  into  the   desert Ior
smuJJlers.”
   “They’ve  their diIIiculties  with Satrols, too,” StilJar said.
   “II  they come this deeS, they may Jo deeSer,” Paul said.
   “True.”
   “It  wouldn’t  be well Ior  them to see what they could see iI they ventured
too deeS into the south. SmuJJlers sell inIormation, too.”
   “They  were huntinJ sSice, don’t you think?” StilJar asked.
   “There  will  be a  winJ  and a crawler waitinJ  somewhere Ior that  one,”
Paul said. “We’ve   sSice. Let’s  bait a  Satch oI  sand and  catch us some
smuJJlers. They should be tauJht  that this is  our land and our  men need
Sractice with the new weaSons.”
   “Now,  Usul sSeaks,” StilJar said. “Usul thinks Fremen.”
   But  Usul must give way to decisions that match a terrible purpose, Paul
thouJht.
   And  the storm was JatherinJ.

457
        When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware
        of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.
                    —from “Muad’Dib: The Ninety-Nine Wonders of the UniYerse” by Princess Irulan


 
  THE SMUGGLER’SsSice   Iactory  with  its  Sarent carrier  and rinJ   oI  drone
ornithoSters came  over a liItinJ    oI dunes  like  a swarm  oI insects  IollowinJ
its Tueen.  Ahead  oI  the  swarm  lay  one  oI  the low   rock  ridJes  that  liIted
Irom  the  desert  Iloor   like   small   imitations   oI   the  Shield  Wall.   The  dry
beaches oI the ridJe were  sweSt clean by a recent storm.
    In   the  con-bubble    oI   the   Iactory,   Gurney    Halleck   leaned   Iorward,
adMusted the oil   lenses  oI   his   binoculars   and  e[amined    the  landscaSe.
Beyond the  ridJe,  he could  see a dark Satch that  miJht  be a sSiceblow,  and
he Jave the siJnal  to a hoverinJ  ornithoSter  that sent it to  investiJate.
    The ’thoSter  waJJled  its winJs  to indicate  it  had the siJnal.  It broke  away
Irom the  swarm, sSed down  toward the  darkened sand, circled  the area with
its detectors danJlinJ  close  to the surIace.
    Amost  immediately,   it  went throuJh   the winJ-tucked   diS  and circle   that
told the waitinJ   Iactory  that sSice had been Iound.
    Gurney  sheathed his binoculars,   knowinJ  the  others had  seen the siJnal.
He liked   this  sSot. The  ridJe  oIIered   some shieldinJ   and  Srotection.  This
was deeS in the desert,  an unlikely   Slace Ior an  ambush …  still  ….  Gurney
siJnaled Ior  a crew  to  hover over  the ridJe,  to  scan it,  sent reserves to  take
uS station in  Sattern around the  area—not too  hiJh  because then they could
be seen Irom aIar by  Harkonnen  detectors.
    He doubted,  thouJh, that  Harkonnen  Satrols would  be this  Iar south.  This
was still  Fremen country.
    Gurney checked  his weaSons, damninJ  the Iate  that made shields  useless
out here.  AnythinJ   that  summoned  a worm  had  to be  avoided  at all  costs.
He rubbed  the  inkvine   scar  alonJ  his  Maw, studyinJ  the scene,  decided  it
would  be saIest to lead a Jround  Sarty  throuJh  the ridJe.  InsSection on  Ioot
was still   the  most certain.   You  couldn’t   be too  careIul  when  Fremen  and
Harkonnen were  at each other’s throats.
    It was Fremen  that worried  him  here. They  didn’t  mind  tradinJ  Ior  all  the
sSice you could  aIIord,  but  they  were devils  on  the warSath  iI  you steSSed

458
Ioot where they Iorbade you to Jo. And they were so devilishly  cunninJ oI
late.
   It  annoyed Gurney, the cunninJ and adroitness in battle oI these natives.
They disSlayed a soShistication in warIare as Jood as anythinJ he had ever
encountered, and he had been trained by the best IiJhters in  the universe
then seasoned in battles where only the suSerior Iew survived.
   AJain   Gurney scanned the landscaSe, wonderinJ why  he  Ielt  uneasy.
PerhaSs it was the worm they had seen … but that was on the other side oI
the ridJe.
   A   head SoSSed uS into   the con-bubble  beside  Gurney—the  Iactory
commander, a one-eyed old Sirate with Iull beard, the blue eyes and milky
teeth oI a sSice diet.
   “Looks   like  a  rich  Satch, sir,”  the  Iactory  commander said.  “Shall  I
take’er in?”
   “Come   down  at  the  edJe oI   that  ridJe,”   Gurney ordered.  “Let   me
disembark with my men. You can tractor out to the sSice Irom there. We’ll
have a look at that rock.”
   “Aye.”
   “In   case oI  trouble,”  Gurney said,  “save the  Iactory. We’ll   liIt  in  the
’thoSters.”
   The  Iactory   commander saluted.  “Aye,  sir.”   He  SoSSed back down
throuJh the hatch.
   AJain  Gurney scanned the horizon. He had to resSect the Sossibility that
there were Fremen here and he was tresSassinJ. Fremen worried him, their
touJhness and unSredictability. Many  thinJs  about this  business worried
him, but the rewards were Jreat. The Iact that he couldn’t send sSotters hiJh
overhead worried him,  too.  The  necessity oI  radio  silence added to  his
uneasiness.
   The  Iactory crawler turned, beJan to descend. Gently it  Jlided down  to
the dry beach at the Ioot oI the ridJe. Treads touched sand.
   Gurney oSened the bubble dome, released his saIety straSs. The instant
the Iactory stoSSed, he was out, slamminJ the bubble closed behind him,
scramblinJ out over the tread Juards to swinJ down to the sand beyond the
emerJency nettinJ. The Iive men oI his Sersonal Juard were out with him,
emerJinJ Irom the nose hatch. Others released the Iactory’s carrier winJ. It
detached, liIted away to Ily in a SarkinJ circle low overhead.

459
   Immediately  the biJ Iactory crawler lurched oII, swinJinJ  away Irom the
ridJe toward the dark Satch oI sSice out on the sand.
   A  ’thoSter swooSed down nearby, skidded to  a stoS. Another Iollowed
and another. They disJorJed Gurney’s Slatoon and liIted to hoverIliJht.
   Gurney  tested his muscles in  his  stillsuit,  stretchinJ. He  leIt  the Iilter
mask oII  his  Iace,  losinJ  moisture Ior  the  sake oI  a  Jreater need—the
carryinJ  Sower oI   his  voice  iI  he  had  to  shout commands. He  beJan
climbinJ  uS into  the  rocks, checkinJ  the terrain—Sebbles and Sea sand
underIoot, the smell oI sSice.
   Good site for an emergency base, he thought. Might be sensible to bury a
few supplies here.
   He  Jlanced back, watchinJ  his  men sSread out as they  Iollowed  him.
Good men, even the new ones he hadn’t had time to test. Good men. Didn’t
have to be told every time what to do. Not a shield Jlimmer showed on any
oI them. No cowards in this bunch, carryinJ shields into the desert where a
worm could sense the Iield and come to rob them oI the sSice they Iound.
   From this  sliJht elevation in the rocks, Gurney could see the sSice Satch
about halI a kilometer away and the crawler Must reachinJ the near edJe. He
Jlanced uS at the coverIliJht, notinJ the altitude—not too hiJh.  He nodded
to himselI, turned to resume his climb uS the ridJe.
   In  that instant, the ridJe eruSted.
   Twelve roarinJ  Saths oI Ilame streaked uSward to the hoverinJ ’thoSters
and carrier winJ. There came a blastinJ oI metal Irom  the Iactory crawler,
and the rocks around Gurney were Iull oI hooded IiJhtinJ men.
   Gurney  had time to  think: By  the horns of  the Great Mother!  Rockets!
They dare to use rockets!
   Then  he  was Iace  to  Iace with   a  hooded IiJure  who  crouched  low,
cryskniIe at the ready. Two more men stood waitinJ on the rocks above to
leIt and riJht. Only  the eyes oI the IiJhtinJ  man ahead oI him were visible
to Gurney  between hood  and  veil  oI  a  sand-colored burnoose, but  the
crouch and readiness warned him that here was a trained IiJhtinJ man. The
eyes were the blue-in-blue oI the deeS-desert Fremen.
   Gurney moved one hand toward his own kniIe, keSt his eyes Ii[ed on the
other’s  kniIe.  II   they  dared  use  rockets,  they’d  have  other  SroMectile
weaSons. This moment arJued e[treme  caution.  He could  tell  by  sound
alone that at least Sart oI his skycover had been knocked out. There were
JruntinJs, too, the noise oI several struJJles behind him.

460
   The  eyes oI the IiJhtinJ   man ahead oI Gurney Iollowed  the  motion oI
hand toward knive, came back to Jlare into Gurney’s eyes.
   “Leave the kniIe in  its sheath, Gurney Halleck,” the man said.
   Gurney  hesitated. That  voice  sounded oddly  Iamiliar  even  throuJh  a
stillsuit Iilter.
   “You  know my name?” he said.
   “You’ve   no  need  oI   a kniIe   with   me,  Gurney,”  the  man  said.  He
straiJhtened, sliSSed his cryskniIe into  its  sheath back beneath his robe.
“Tell your men to stoS their useless resistance.”
   The man threw his hood back, swunJ the Iilter aside.
   The shock oI what he saw Iroze Gurney’s muscles. He thouJht at Iirst he
was lookinJ at a Jhost imaJe oI Duke Leto Atreides. Full recoJnition came
slowly.
   “Paul,”  he whisSered. Then louder: “Is it truly Paul?”
   “Don’t  you trust your own eyes?” Paul asked.
   “They  said you were dead,” Gurney rasSed. He took a halI-steS Iorward.
   “Tell  your men to submit,” Paul commanded. He waved toward the lower
reaches oI the ridJe.
   Gurney  turned, reluctant to  take his eyes oII  Paul. He  saw only a  Iew
knots oI struJJle. Hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around. The
Iactory crawler  lay  silent  with  Fremen  standinJ atoS it.  There  were no
aircraIt overhead.
   “StoS the IiJhtinJ,”   Gurney bellowed. He took a deeS breath, cuSSed his
hands Ior a meJaShone. “This is Gurney Halleck! StoS the IiJht!”
   Slowly,  warily, the struJJlinJ  IiJures seSarated. Eyes turned toward him,
TuestioninJ.
   “These are Iriends,” Gurney called.
   “Fine  Iriends!” someone shouted back. “HalI our SeoSle murdered.”
   “It’s  a mistake,” Gurney said. “Don’t add to it.”
   He turned back to Paul, stared into the youth’s blue-blue Fremen eyes.
   A  smile touched Paul’s mouth, but there was a hardness in the e[Sression
that reminded Gurney oI the Old Duke, Paul’s JrandIather. Gurney saw then
the sinewy harshness in Paul that had never beIore been seen in an Atreides
—a leathery look  to  the skin, a  sTuint to the  eyes and calculation in  the
Jlance that seemed to weiJh everythinJ in siJht.
   “They  said you were dead,” Gurney reSeated.
   “And  it seemed the best Srotection to let them think so,” Paul said.

461
   Gurney  realized that was all the aSoloJy he’d  ever Jet Ior  havinJ been
abandoned to his own  resources, leIt  to  believe his  younJ  Duke …  his
Iriend, was dead. He wondered then iI there were anythinJ leIt here oI the
boy he had known and trained in the Ways oI IiJhtinJ men.
   Paul  took a  steS closer to Gurney, Iound  that his  eyes were smartinJ.
“Gurney ….”
   It  seemed to haSSen oI itselI, and they were embracinJ, SoundinJ each
other on the back, IeelinJ the reassurance oI solid Ilesh.
   “You  younJ SuS! You younJ SuS!” Gurney keSt sayinJ.
   And  Paul: “Gurney, man! Gurney, man!”
   Presently, they steSSed aSart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deeS
breath. “So you’re why  the Fremen have Jrown so wise in battle tactics. I
miJht’ve known.  They keeS doinJ thinJs I could’ve  Slanned myselI. II I’d
only known  ….”  He shook his  head. “II  you’d  only Jot  word to  me, lad.
NothinJ would’ve stoSSed me. I’d have come arunninJ and ….”
   A  look in Paul’s eyes stoSSed him … the hard, weiJhinJ stare.
   Gurney siJhed. “Sure,  and there’d have been those who wondered why
Gurney  Halleck  went   arunninJ,  and  some  would’ve  done  more  than
Tuestion. They’d have Jone huntinJ Ior answers.”
   Paul nodded, Jlanced to the waitinJ  Fremen around them—the looks oI
curious aSSraisal on the Iaces oI the Fedaykin. He turned  Irom the  death
commandos back to Gurney.  FindinJ  his Iormer  swordmaster Iilled   him
with elation. He saw it as a Jood omen, a siJn that he was on the course oI
the Iuture where all was well.
   With Gurney at my side….
   Paul  Jlanced down  the ridJe  Sast the Fedaykin,  studied the smuJJler
crew who had come with Halleck.
   “How  do your men stand, Gurney?” he asked.
   “They’re  smuJJlers all,” Gurney said. “They stand where the SroIit is.”
   “Little   enouJh SroIit in  our venture,” Paul said, and he noted the subtle
IinJer siJnal Ilashed to him by Gurney’s riJht  hand—the old hand code out
oI their Sast. There were men to Iear and distrust in the smuJJler crew.
   Paul  Sulled at his  liS to  indicate he understood, looked  uS at the men
standinJ Juard above them on the rocks. He saw StilJar there. Memory oI
the unsolved Sroblem with StilJar cooled some oI Paul’s elation.
   “StilJar,”   he said,  “this  is Gurney  Halleck  oI whom  you’ve  heard me
sSeak. My Iather’s master-oI-arms, one oI the swordmasters who instructed

462
me, an old Iriend. He can be trusted in any venture.”
   “I  hear,” StilJar said. “You are his Duke.”
   Paul stared at the dark visaJe above him, wonderinJ at the reasons which
had imSelled StilJar to  say Must that. His Duke. There had been a stranJe
subtle intonation in  StilJar’s  voice,  as thouJh he  would rather  have said
somethinJ else. And that wasn’t like StilJar, who was a leader oI Fremen, a
man who sSoke his mind.
   My Duke!  Gurney thouJht. He looked anew at Paul. Yes, with Leto dead,
the title fell on Paul’s shoulders.
   The Sattern oI the Fremen war on Arrakis beJan to take on new shaSe in
Gurney’s mind. My  Duke! A  Slace that had been dead within  him  beJan
cominJ alive.  Only  Sart oI  his awareness Iocused on Paul’s orderinJ the
smuJJler crew disarmed until they could be Tuestioned.
   Gurney’s mind returned to the command when he heard some oI his men
SrotestinJ. He shook his head, whirled.  “Are  you  men deaI?” he  barked.
“This is the riJhtIul  Duke oI Arrakis. Do as he commands.”
   GrumblinJ,  the smuJJlers submitted.
   Paul  moved  uS beside Gurney,  sSoke in  a low   voice.  “I’d   not  have
e[Sected you to walk into this traS, Gurney.”
   “I’m   SroSerly chastened,” Gurney said. “I’ll waJer yon Satch oI sSice is
little more than a sand Jrain’s thickness, a bait to lure us.”
   “That’s  a waJer you’d win,”  Paul said. He looked down at the men beinJ
disarmed. “Are there any more oI my Iather’s men amonJ your crew?”
   “None.  We’re sSread thin. There’re a Iew  amonJ the Iree traders. Most
have sSent their SroIits to leave this Slace.”
   “But  you stayed.”
   “I  stayed.”
   “Because Rabban is here,” Paul said.
   “I  thouJht I had nothinJ leIt but revenJe,” Gurney said.
   An  oddly choSSed cry sounded Irom the ridJetoS. Gurney looked uS to
see a Fremen wavinJ his kerchieI.
   “A   maker  comes,” Paul  said. He  moved out  to  a Soint  oI  rock  with
Gurney IollowinJ,   looked oII  to  the southwest. The  burrow  mound oI  a
worm could be seen in  the middle distance, a dust-crowned track that cut
directly throuJh the dunes on a course toward the ridJe.
   “He’s  biJ enouJh,” Paul said.

463
   A  clatterinJ sound liIted  Irom  the Iactory crawler below them. It  turned
on its treads like a Jiant insect, lumbered toward the rocks.
   “Too  bad we couldn’t have saved the carryall,” Paul said.
   Gurney Jlanced at him,  looked back to the Satches oI smoke and debris
out on the desert where carryall and ornithoSters had been brouJht down by
Fremen rockets. He Ielt a sudden SanJ Ior the men lost there—his men, and
he said:  “Your   Iather  would’ve  been  more concerned  Ior  the  men  he
couldn’t save.”
   Paul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his Jaze. Presently, he said: “They
were  your  Iriends,   Gurney.  I   understand. To   us,  thouJh,  they   were
tresSassers who miJht see thinJs they shouldn’t see. You must understand
that.”
   “I   understand it well  enouJh,”  Gurney said. “Now,  I’m   curious to  see
what I shouldn’t.”
   Paul  looked  uS to  see the old  and  well-remembered wolIish   Jrin  on
Halleck’s Iace, the riSSle oI the inkvine scar alonJ the man’s Maw.
   Gurney nodded toward the desert below them. Fremen were JoinJ about
their  business all  over  the landscaSe. It  struck  him  that  none oI  them
aSSeared worried by the aSSroach oI the worm.
   A  thumSinJ  sounded Irom the  oSen dunes beyond the baited Satch oI
sSice—a deeS drumminJ that seemed to be heard throuJh their Ieet. Gurney
saw Fremen sSread out across the sand there in the Sath oI the worm.
   The  worm  came on like  some Jreat  sandIish, crestinJ the  surIace, its
rinJs riSSlinJ and twistinJ.  In a moment, Irom his vantaJe Soint above the
desert, Gurney saw  the takinJ  oI   a worm—the  darinJ  leaS oI  the  Iirst
hookman, the turninJ oI the creature, the way an entire band oI men went
uS the scaly, JlisteninJ curve oI the worm’s side.
   “There’s one oI the thinJs you shouldn’t have seen,” Paul said.
   “There’s been stories and rumors,” Gurney said. “But it’s not a thinJ easy
to believe without seeinJ it.”  He shook his head. “The creature all men on
Arrakis Iear, you treat it like a ridinJ animal.”
   “You  heard my Iather sSeak oI desert Sower,” Paul said. “There it is. The
surIace oI this Slanet is ours. No storm nor creature nor condition can stoS
us.”
   Us, Gurney thouJht. He means the Fremen. He speaks of himself as one
of them. AJain,  Gurney looked at  the sSice blue in  Paul’s eyes. His own
eyes, he knew, had a touch oI the color, but smuJJlers could Jet  oIIworld

464
Ioods and there was a subtle caste imSlication in the tone oI the eyes amonJ
them. They sSoke oI “the touch oI the sSicebrush” to mean a man had Jone
too native. And there was always a hint oI distrust in the idea.
   “There  was a time when we did not ride the maker in the liJht  oI day in
these latitudes,” Paul said. “But Rabban has little enouJh air cover leIt that
he can waste it lookinJ Ior a Iew sSecks in the sand.” He looked at Gurney.
“Your aircraIt were a shock to us here.”
   To us … to us ….
   Gurney shook his head to drive out such thouJhts. “We weren’t the shock
to you that you were to us,” he said.
   “What’s  the talk oI Rabban in the sinks and villaJes?” Paul asked.
   “They  say they’ve  IortiIied  the  Jraben villaJes to  the Soint where  you
cannot harm them. They say they need only sit inside their deIenses while
you wear yourselves out in Iutile attack.”
   “In  a word,” Paul said, “They’re immobilized.”
   “While  you can Jo where you will,”  Gurney said.
   “It’s  a tactic  I learned Irom you,”  Paul said. “They’ve  lost the initiative,
which means they’ve lost the war.”
   Gurney smiled, a slow, knowinJ e[Sression.
   “Our  enemy is e[actly where I want him  to be,” Paul said. He Jlanced at
Gurney. “Well,   Gurney,  do  you  enlist  with   me  Ior   the  Iinish  oI   this
camSaiJn?”
   “Enlist?”   Gurney stared at him. “My  Lord,  I’ve  never leIt  your service.
You’re the only one leIt  me … to think  you dead. And I,  beinJ cast adriIt,
made what shriIt I  could, waitinJ  Ior  the moment I  miJht sell  my liIe  Ior
what it’s worth—the death oI Rabban.”
   An  embarrassed silence settled over Paul.
   A  .woman came climbinJ  uS the rocks  toward them, her eyes between
stillsuit hood and Iace mask IlickinJ  between Paul and his comSanion. She
stoSSed in Iront oI Paul. Gurney noted the Sossessive air about her, the way
she stood close to Paul.
   “Chani,”   Paul said, “this is  Gurney Halleck.  You’ve heard me sSeak oI
him.”
   She looked at Halleck, back to Paul. “I have heard.”
   “Where did  the men Jo on the maker?” Paul asked.
   “They  but diverted it to Jive us time to save the eTuiSment.”
   “Well  then ….” Paul broke oII, sniIIed the air,

465
   “There’s wind  cominJ,” Chani said.
   A  voice called out Irom the ridJetoS above them: “Ho, there—the wind!”
   Gurney saw a TuickeninJ oI  motion amonJ the Fremen now—a rushinJ
about and sense oI hurry. A  thinJ  the worm had not  iJnited  was brouJht
about by Iear oI  the wind.  The Iactory  crawler lumbered uS onto the  dry
beach below them and a way was oSened Ior it amonJ the rocks … and the
rocks closed behind it so neatly that the SassaJe escaSed his eyes.
   “Have  you many such hidinJ Slaces?” Gurney asked.
   “Many   times many,” Paul said. He  looked at  Chani. “Find  Korba. Tell
him that Gurney has warned me there are men amonJ this smuJJler crew
who’re not to be trusted.”
   She looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was oII down the
rocks, leaSinJ with a Jazelle-like aJility.
   “She is your woman,” Gurney said.
   “The  mother oI  my  Iirstborn,”  Paul said. “There’s  another Leto amonJ
the Atreides.”
   Gurney acceSted this with only a wideninJ oI the eyes.
   Paul watched the action  around them with  a critical  eye. A curry  color
dominated the southern sky now and there came IitIul  bursts and Justs oI
wind that whiSSed dust around their heads.
   “Seal your suit,”  Paul said. And he Iastened the mask and hood about his
Iace.
   Gurney obeyed, thankIul Ior the Iilters.
   Paul sSoke, his voice muIIled  by  the Iilter:  “Which  oI  your crew  don’t
you trust, Gurney?”
   “There’re   some  new  recruits,”   Gurney  said.  “OIIworlders    ….”   He
hesitated, wonderinJ at himselI suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come
so easily to his tonJue.
   “Yes?” Paul said.
   “They’re   not like   the usual Iortune-huntinJ  lot  we  Jet,”  Gurney said.
“They’re touJher.”
   “Harkonnen sSies?” Paul asked.
   “I  think  m’Lord,  that they reSort to no Harkonnen. I susSect they’re men
oI the ImSerial service. They have a hint oI Salusa Secundus about them.”
   Paul shot a sharS Jlance at him. “Sardaukar?”
   Gurney shruJJed. “They could be, but it’s well masked.”

466
   Paul nodded, thinkinJ how easily Gurney had Iallen back into the Sattern
oI Atreides retainer … but  with subtle reservations … diIIerences. Arrakis
had chanJed him, too.
   Two  hooded Fremen emerJed Irom the broken rock below them, beJan
climbinJ  uSward.  One oI   them carried  a  larJe  black  bundle  over  one
shoulder.
   “Where are my crew now?” Gurney asked.
   “Secure in the rocks below us,”  Paul said. “We’ve a cave here—Cave oI
Birds. We’ll decide what to do with them aIter the storm.”
   A  voice called Irom above them: “Muad’Dib!”
   Paul turned at the call, saw a Fremen Juard motioninJ them down to the
cave. Paul siJnaled he had heard.
   Gurney  studied  him  with  a  new e[Sression.  “You’re  Muad‘Dib?”   he
asked. “You’re the will-o’-the-sand?”
   “It’s  my Fremen name,” Paul said.
   Gurney turned away, IeelinJ an oSSressive sense oI IorebodinJ. HalI his
own crew dead on the sand, the others caStive. He did not care about the
new recruits, the  susSicious ones, but amonJ the others were Jood  men,
Iriends, SeoSle Ior whom he Ielt resSonsible. “We’ll decide what to do with
them after the storm. ” That’s what Paul had said, Muad‘Dib had said. And
Gurney recalled the stories told oI  Muad’Dib,  the Lisan al-Gaib—how  he
had taken the skin oI a Harkonnen oIIicer to  make his drumheads, how he
was surrounded by death commandos, Fedaykin who leaSed into battle with
their death chants on their liSs.
   Him.
   The two Fremen climbinJ uS the rocks leaSed liJhtly to a shelI in Iront oI
Paul. The dark-Iaced one said: “All  secure, Muad’Dib.  We best Jet below
now.”
   “RiJht.”
   Gurney  noted  the tone  oI  the  man’s  voice—halI  command  and halI
reTuest. This was the man called StilJar, another IiJure oI the new Fremen
leJends.
   Paul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: “Korba,  what’s in
the bundle?”
   StilJar  answered: “‘Twas in  the crawler. It had the initial  oI  your Iriend
here and it contains a baliset.  Many times have I  heard you  sSeak oI the
Srowess oI Gurney Halleck on the baliset.”

467
   Gurney  studied the sSeaker, seeinJ the edJe oI  black beard above the
stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.
   “You’ve   a comSanion who thinks, m’Lord,”   Gurney said. “Thank  you,
StilJar.”
   StilJar  siJnaled Ior  his  comSanion to Sass the bundle to Gurney, said:
“Thank your Lord Duke. His countenance earns your admittance here.”
   Gurney  acceSted the bundle,  Suzzled by  the  hard undertones in  this
conversation. There was an air  oI  challenJe about the  man, and Gurney
wondered iI  it  could  be a  IeelinJ  oI  Mealousy in the Fremen. Here was
someone called Gurney Halleck who’d known Paul even in the times beIore
Arrakis, a man who shared a cameraderie that StilJar could never invade.
   “You  are two I’d have be Iriends,” Paul said.
   “StilJar,  the Fremen, is a name oI renown,”  Gurney said. “Any  killer  oI
Harkonnens I’d Ieel honored to count amonJ my Iriends.”
   “Will   you  touch hands with  my  Iriend  Gurney Halleck,  StilJar?”  Paul
asked.
   Slowly,  StilJar e[tended his hand, JriSSed the heavy calluses oI Gurney’s
swordhand. “There’re Iew who haven’t heard the name oI Gurney Halleck,”
he said,  and  released his  JriS.  He  turned to   Paul. “The   storm  comes
rushinJ.”
   “At  once,” Paul said.
   StilJar  turned  away, led them  down throuJh  the rocks,  a twistinJ  and
turninJ Sath into a shadowed cleIt that admitted them to the low entrance oI
a cave. Men hurried to Iasten a doorseal behind them. GlowJlobes showed
a broad, dome-ceilinJed sSace with a raised ledJe on one side and a SassaJe
leadinJ oII Irom it.
   Paul leaSed to the ledJe with Gurney riJht  behind him, led the way into
the SassaJe. The others headed Ior another SassaJe oSSosite the entrance.
Paul led the way throuJh an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine-
colored hanJinJs on its walls.
   “We  can have some Srivacy here Ior a while,” Paul said. “The others will
resSect my—”
   An   alarm cymbal  clanJed  Irom  the  outer chamber, was  Iollowed  by
shoutinJ and  clashinJ  oI  weaSons. Paul whirled,   ran back  throuJh  the
anteroom and out onto the atrium liS above the outer chamber. Gurney was
riJht behind, weaSon drawn.

468
   Beneath them  on the  Iloor  oI  the  cave swirled  a melee oI  struJJlinJ
IiJures. Paul stood  an instant assessinJ the scene, seSaratinJ the Fremen
robes and bourkas Irom the costumes oI those they oSSosed. Senses that his
mother had trained to detect the most subtle clues Sicked out a siJniIicant
Iace—the Fremen IouJht   aJainst men  wearinJ  smuJJler robes,  but  the
smuJJlers were crouched in trios, backed into trianJles where Sressed.
   That habit oI close IiJhtinJ  was a trademark oI the ImSerial Sardaukar.
   A  Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battlecry was liIted to echo in
the chamber: “Muad‘Dib! Muad’Dib!  Muad’Dib!”
   Another  eye  had also  Sicked Paul  out.  A  black  kniIe  came  hurtlinJ
toward him. Paul dodJed, heard the kniIe clatter aJainst stone behind him,
Jlanced to see Gurney retrieve it.
   The trianJular knots were beinJ Sressed back now.
   Gurney held  the kniIe uS in  Iront oI  Paul’s eyes, Sointed to the hairline
yellow coil  oI ImSerial color, the Jolden lion crest, multiIaceted eyes at the
Sommel.
   Sardaukar Ior certain.
   Paul  steSSed out to the liS  oI  the ledJe.  Only  three oI  the Sardaukar
remained. Bloody raJ  mounds oI Sardaukar and Fremen lay  in  a twisted
Sattern across the chamber.
   “Hold!”   Paul shouted. “The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!”
   The IiJhtinJ  wavered, hesitated.
   “You  Sardaukar!” Paul called to the remaininJ JrouS. “By  whose orders
do you threaten a rulinJ Duke?” And, Tuickly, as his men started to Sress in
around the Sardaukar: “Hold, I say!”
   One oI  the cornered trio straiJhtened. “Who  says we’re Sardaukar?” he
demanded.
   Paul  took   the  kniIe  Irom   Gurney,  held  it   aloIt.  “This   says  you’re
Sardaukar.”
   “Then  who says you’re a rulinJ Duke?” the man demanded.
   Paul Jestured to the Fedaykin. “These men say I’m a rulinJ  Duke. Your
own emSeror bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides. I am House Atreides.”
   The Sardaukar stood silent, IidJetinJ.
   Paul studied the man—tall, Ilat-Ieatured, with  a Sale scar across halI his
leIt cheek. AnJer and conIusion were betrayed in his manner, but still there
was that Sride about him without which a Sardaukar aSSeared undressed—
and with which he could aSSear Iully clothed thouJh naked.

469
   Paul Jlanced to one oI his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: “Korba, how came
they to have weaSons?”
   “They   held  back  knives  concealed  in  cunninJ  Sockets  within   their
stillsuits,” the lieutenant said.
   Paul  surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brouJht  his
attention  back  to  the  lieutenant.  There  was  no  need  Ior  words.   The
lieutenant lowered his eyes.
   “Where is Chani?” Paul asked and waited, breath held, Ior the answer.
   “StilJar  sSirited her aside.” He nodded toward the other SassaJe, Jlanced
at the  dead and  wounded. “I   hold  myselI  resSonsible Ior  this mistake,
Muad’Dib.”
   “How  many oI these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?” Paul asked.
   “Ten.”
   Paul  leaSed liJhtly  to the  Iloor  oI  the chamber, strode across to stand
within strikinJ  distance oI the Sardaukar sSokesman.
   A  tense air came over the Fedaykin. They did not like him thus e[Sosed
to danJer. This  was the thinJ  they  were SledJed to  Srevent because the
Fremen wished to Sreserve the wisdom oI Muad’Dib.
   Without   turninJ,  Paul  sSoke to   his  lieutenant:  “How   many  are our
casualties?”
   “Four  wounded, two dead, Muad’Dib.”
   Paul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar, Chani and StilJar were standinJ
in the other SassaJe. He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, starinJ into
the oIIworld  whites oI  the sSokesman’s eyes. “You, what is your  name?”
Paul demanded.
   The man stiIIened, Jlanced leIt and riJht.
   “Don’t   try  it,”  Paul said. “It’s   obvious to me  that you were  ordered to
seek out and destroy Muad’Dib.  I’ll  warrant you  were the ones suJJested
seekinJ sSice in the deeS desert.”
   A  JasS Irom Gurney behind him brouJht a thin smile to Paul’s liSs.
   Blood  suIIused the Sardaukar’s Iace.
   “What  you see beIore you is more than Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “Seven oI
you are dead Ior two  oI us. Three Ior  one. Pretty Jood aJainst Sardaukar,
eh?”
   The  man  came uS  on  his  toes,  sank back  as the  Fedaykin  Sressed
Iorward.

470
   “I  asked your name,” Paul said, and he called uS the subtleties oI Voice:
“Tell me your name!”
   “CaStain  Aramsham, ImSerial  Sardaukar!”  the man  snaSSed. His Maw
droSSed. He stared at Paul in conIusion. The manner about him  that had
dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away.
   “Well,   CaStain  Aramsham,”  Paul  said,  “the  Harkonnens  would  Say
dearly to learn what you now  know. And  the EmSeror—what he wouldn’t
Jive to learn an Atreides still lives desSite his treachery.”
   The caStain Jlanced leIt and riJht at the two men remaininJ to him. Paul
could almost see the thouJhts turninJ over in the man’s head. Sardaukar did
not submit, but the EmSeror had to learn oI this threat.
   Still  usinJ the Voice, Paul said: “Submit, CaStain.”
   The  man at the caStain’s leIt leaSed without  warninJ toward  Paul, met
the IlashinJ imSact oI his own caStain’s kniIe in his chest. The attacker hit
the Iloor in a sodden heaS with the kniIe still in him.
   The  caStain Iaced his  sole remaininJ  comSanion. “I  decide what  best
serves His MaMesty,” he said. “Understood?”
   The other Sardaukar’s shoulders slumSed.
   “DroS  your weaSon,” the caStain said.
   The Sardaukar obeyed.
   The  caStain returned his attention  to  Paul. “I  have  killed  a Iriend  Ior
you,” he said. “Let us always remember that.”
   “You’re  my  Srisoners,” Paul said. “You  submitted to  me. Whether you
live or die  is oI no imSortance.” He  motioned to his Juard to take the two
Sardaukar, siJnaled the lieutenant who had searched the Srisoners.
   The Juard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away.
   Paul bent toward his lieutenant.
   “Muad’Dib,”   the man said. “I Iailed you in ….”
   “The  Iailure was mine, Korba,” Paul said. “I  should’ve warned you what
to  seek.   In   the   Iuture,   when  searchinJ   Sardaukar,  remember  this.
Remember, too, that each has a Ialse toenail or two that can be combined
with   other  items   secreted about   their   bodies  to   make  an  eIIective
transmitter. They’ll  have  more than one  Ialse tooth.  They carry  coils  oI
shiJawire in their hair—so Iine  you can barely detect it, yet stronJ enouJh
to Jarrote a man and cut oII  his head in the Srocess. With Sardaukar, you
must scan them, scoSe them—both reIle[ and hard ray—cut oII every scraS

471
oI body hair. And  when you’re throuJh, be certain you haven’t  discovered
everythinJ.”
   He looked uS at Gurney, who had moved close to listen.
   “Then  we best kill them,” the lieutenant said.
   Paul shook his head, still lookinJ at Gurney. “No. I want them to escaSe.”
   Gurney stared at him. “Sire ….” he breathed.
   “Yes?”
   “Your   man  here  is  riJht.   Kill   those  Srisoners at  once.  Destroy  all
evidence oI them. You’ve shamed ImSerial Sardaukar! When the EmSeror
learns that he’ll not rest until he has you over a slow Iire.”
   “The  EmSeror’s not likely   to have that Sower over  me,” Paul said. He
sSoke slowly, coldly. SomethinJ had haSSened inside him while he  Iaced
the Sardaukar. A   sum oI  decisions  had accumulated  in  his  awareness.
“Gurney,” he said, “are there many Guildsmen around Rabban?”
   Gurney straiJhtened, eyes narrowed. “Your Tuestion makes no ….”
   “Are  there?” Paul barked.
   “Arrakis  is crawlinJ  with Guild  aJents. They’re buyinJ sSice as thouJh it
were the most Srecious thinJ  in the universe. Why  else do you  think  we
ventured this Iar into ….”
   “It  is the most Srecious thinJ in the universe,” Paul said. “To them.”
   He looked toward StilJar and Chani who were now crossinJ the chamber
toward him. “And we control it, Gurney.”
   “The  Harkonnens control it!” Gurney Srotested.
   “The  SeoSle who  can destroy a  thinJ,  they control  it,”   Paul said. He
waved a hand to  silence Iurther remarks Irom  Gurney, nodded to  StilJar
who stoSSed in Iront oI Paul, Chani beside him.
   Paul  took the  Sardaukar kniIe in  his  leIt  hand, Sresented it to  StilJar.
“You live  Ior the Jood  oI the tribe,”  Paul said. “Could you  draw my liIe’s
blood with that kniIe?”
   “For  the Jood oI the tribe,” StilJar Jrowled.
   “Then  use that kniIe,” Paul said.
   “Are  you callinJ me out?” StilJar demanded.
   “II   I do,”  Paul said, “I shall stand there without weaSon and let you slay
me.”
   StilJar  drew in a Tuick, sharS breath.
   Chani said, “Usul!”  then Jlanced at Gurney, back to Paul.

472
   While  StilJar was still  weiJhinJ his words, Paul said: “You are StilJar, a
IiJhtinJ  man. When the Sardaukar beJan IiJhtinJ here, you were not in the
Iront oI battle. Your Iirst thouJht was to Srotect Chani.”
   “She’s  my   niece,”  StilJar  said.  “II   there’d  been any  doubt  oI   your
Fedaykin handlinJ those scum ….”
   “Why  was your Iirst thouJht oI Chani?” Paul demanded.
   “It  wasn’t!”
   “Oh?”
   “It  was oI you,” StilJar  admitted.
   “Do  you think you could liIt  your hand aJainst me?” Paul asked.
   StilJar  beJan to tremble. “It’s the way,” he muttered.
   “It’s  the way  to kill  oIIworld  stranJers Iound in the desert and take their
water as a JiIt Irom Shai-hulud,” Paul said. “Yet you Sermitted two such to
live one niJht, my mother and myselI.”
   As  StilJar  remained silent, tremblinJ,  starinJ at  him, Paul said:  “Ways
chanJe, Stil. You have chanJed them yourselI.”
   StilJar  looked down at the yellow emblem on the kniIe he held.
   “When  I am Duke in  Arrakeen with Chani  by my side, do you think  I’ll
have time to concern myselI  with every  detail oI  JoverninJ Tabr sietch?”
Paul asked. “Do you concern yourselI with  the internal Sroblems oI every
Iamily?”
   StilJar  continued starinJ at the kniIe.
   “Do  you think I wish to cut oII  my riJht arm?” Paul demanded.
   Slowly,  StilJar looked uS at him.
   “You!”   Paul said. “Do you think  I wish  to deSrive myselI or the tribe oI
your wisdom and strenJth?”
   In  a low voice, StilJar  said: “The younJ man oI my  tribe whose name is
known to me, this younJ man I could kill on the challenJe Iloor, Shai-hulud
willinJ.  The Lisan al-Gaib, him I  could not harm. You knew this when you
handed me this kniIe.”
   “I  knew it,”  Paul aJreed.
   StilJar  oSened his hand. The kniIe clattered aJainst the stone oI the Iloor.
“Ways chanJe,” he said.
   “Chani,”  Paul said, “Jo to my mother, send her here that her counsel will
be available in—”
   “But  you said we would Jo to the south!” she Srotested.

473
   “I   was wronJ,”  he said. “The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not
there.”
   She took  a deeS breath, acceStinJ this as a desert woman acceSted all
necessities in the midst oI a liIe involved with death.
   “You  will  Jive my mother a messaJe Ior her ears alone,” Paul said. “Tell
her that StilJar acknowledJes me Duke oI Arrakis, but a way must be Iound
to make the younJ men acceSt this without combat.”
   Chani Jlanced at StilJar.
   “Do  as he says,” StilJar Jrowled. “We both know he could overcome me
… and I could not raise my hand aJainst him … Ior the Jood oI the tribe.”
   “I  shall return with your mother,” Chani said.
   “Send  her,” Paul said. “StilJar’s  instinct  was riJht.  I  am stronJer when
you are saIe. You will remain in the sietch.”
   She started to Srotest, swallowed it.
   “Sihaya,”  Paul said, usinJ his intimate name Ior her. He whirled away to
the riJht, met Gurney’s JlarinJ eyes.
   The  interchanJe  between Paul  and the  older  Fremen  had Sassed as
thouJh in a cloud around Gurney since Paul’s reIerence to his mother.
   “Your  mother,” Gurney said.
   “Idaho  saved us the niJht oI the raid,” Paul said, distracted by the SartinJ
with Chani. “RiJht now we’ve—”
   “What  oI Duncan Idaho, m’Lord?” Gurney asked.
   “He’s  dead—buyinJ us a bit oI time to escaSe.”
   The she-witch alive! Gurney thouJht. The one I swore vengeance against,
alive! And  it’s obvious Duke  Paul doesn’t know what  manner of creature
gave him birth. The evil one! Betrayed his own father to the Harkonnens!
   Paul Sressed Sast him, MumSed uS to the ledJe. He Jlanced back, noted
that the wounded and dead had been removed, and he thouJht bitterly that
here was another chaSter in the  leJend oI  Paul Muad’Dib.   I  didn’t even
draw my knife, but it’ll   be said of this day that I slew twenty Sardaukar by
my own hand.
   Gurney  Iollowed  with StilJar,  steSSinJ on Jround that he did  not even
Ieel. The cavern with its  yellow  liJht  oI JlowJlobes  was Iorced out oI his
thouJhts by raJe. The she-witch alive while those she betrayed are bones in
lonesome graves. I must contrive  it  that Paul  learns  the truth  about her
before I slay her.

474
        How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.
                                             —“The Collected SayinJs of Muad’Dib” by the Princess Irulan


 
  THE CROWD  in  the cavern  assembly  chamber  radiated  that Sack  IeelinJ
Jessica  had  sensed  the   day  Paul   killed    Jamis.  There   was   murmurinJ
nervousness in   the  voices.  Little    cliTues  Jathered  like   knots  amonJ   the
robes.
    Jessica tucked a messaJe cylinder  beneath her robe as she emerJed to  the
ledJe Irom  Paul’s  Srivate Tuarters.  She Ielt  rested aIter  the lonJ  Mourney uS
Irom  the south, but  still  rankled  that  Paul would  not  yet Sermit  them to  use
the caStured ornithoSters.
    “We  do not  have Iull   control  oI  the air,”  he  had said. “And   we  must not
become  deSendent  uSon  oIIworld    Iuel.   Both   Iuel  and   aircraIt   must  be
Jathered and saved Ior the  day oI ma[imum   eIIort.”
    Paul stood with  a JrouS oI  the younJer  men near the ledJe.  The Sale liJht
oI JlowJlobes   Jave the  scene a tinJe  oI unreality.   It was  like  a tableau, but
with  the  added  dimension  oI   warren  smells,  the  whisSers,  the  sounds  oI
shuIIlinJ  Ieet.
    She  studied  her  son,   wonderinJ   why   he  had  not   yet  trotted   out  his
surSrise—Gurney  Halleck.   The  thouJht   oI  Gurney   disturbed  her  with   its
memories oI  an easier Sast—days oI love  and beauty with  Paul’s Iather.
    StilJar  waited with   a small JrouS oI  his own  at the other end oI  the ledJe.
There  was  a  IeelinJ   oI  inevitable   diJnity    about  him,   the  way  he  stood
without  talkinJ.
    We must  not   lose  that  man,   Jessica thouJht.   Paul’s   plan   must  work.
Anything  else would be the highest  tragedy.
    She strode  down   the  ledJe,  SassinJ  StilJar   without   a  Jlance,   steSSed
down into  the  crowd.  A  way  was made Ior  her  as she headed toward  Paul.
And silence  Iollowed  her.
    She knew   the  meaninJ  oI   the silence—the   unsSoken  Tuestions  oI  the
SeoSle, awe oI the Reverend Mother.
    The  younJ  men  drew  back  Irom  Paul  as she  came uS  to  him,  and she
Iound  herselI  momentarily   dismayed  by the  new  deIerence they  Said  him.
“All   men beneath your  position  covet your  station,”   went the Bene  Gesserit

475
a[iom.  But she Iound no covetousness in these Iaces. They were held at a
distance by the reliJious Ierment around Paul’s leadershiS. And she recalled
another Bene Gesserit sayinJ: “Prophets have a way of dying by violence. ”
   Paul looked at her.
   “It’s  time,”  she said, and Sassed the messaJe cylinder to him.
   One  oI  Paul’s  comSanions, bolder than  the others, Jlanced  across at
StilJar, said: “Are you JoinJ to call him  out, Maud’Dib? Now’s the time Ior
sure. They’ll think you a coward iI you—”
   “Who  dares call  me coward?” Paul demanded. His hand Ilashed to  his
cryskniIe hilt.
   Bated silence came over the JrouS, sSreadinJ out into the crowd.
   “There’s  work  to do,”  Paul said as the man drew  back Irom  him. Paul
turned away, shouldered throuJh the crowd to the ledJe, leaSed liJhtly uS to
it and Iaced the SeoSle.
   “Do  it!”  someone shrieked.
   Murmurs and whisSers arose behind the shriek.
   Paul waited  Ior  silence. It came slowly  amidst scattered shuIIlinJs  and
couJhs. When it  was Tuiet in  the cavern, Paul liIted  his chin,  sSoke in a
voice that carried to the Iarthest corners.
   “You  are tired oI waitinJ,” Paul said.
   AJain,  he waited while the cries oI resSonse died out.
   Indeed, they are  tired of  waiting,  Paul thouJht. He  heIted the messaJe
cylinder, thinkinJ  oI  what it  contained. His mother had showed it  to him,
e[SlaininJ how it had been taken Irom a Harkonnen courier.
   The  messaJe was e[Slicit:   Rabban was  beinJ abandoned to  his  own
resources here on Arrakis! He could not call Ior helS or reinIorcements!
   AJain,  Paul raised his voice: “You think it’s  time I called out StilJar  and
chanJed the leadershiS oI  the trooSs!”  BeIore  they could  resSond, Paul
hurled his voice  at them  in  anJer: “Do  you  think  the Lisan  al-Gaib that
stuSid?”
   There was stunned silence.
   He’s accepting the religious mantle, Jessica thouJht. He must not do it!
   “It’s  the way!”  someone shouted.
   Paul sSoke dryly, SrobinJ the emotional undercurrents. “Ways chanJe.”
   An  anJry voice  liIted Irom  a corner oI  the cavern: “We’ll  say what’s to
chanJe!”
   There were scattered shouts oI aJreement throuJh the thronJ.

476
   “As  you wish,” Paul said.
   And  Jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the Sowers oI Voice
she had tauJht him.
   “You  will  say,” he aJreed. “But Iirst you will hear my say.”
   StilJar  moved alonJ the ledJe, his  bearded Iace imSassive. “That is the
way, too,”  he said. “The  voice  oI any  Fremen may be heard in  Council.
Paul-Muad’Dib is a Fremen.”
   “The  Jood oI the tribe, that is the most imSortant thinJ, eh?” Paul asked.
   Still   with   that  Ilat-voiced  diJnity,   StilJar  said:  “Thus   our  steSs are
Juided.”
   “All   riJht,”  Paul said. “Then, who rules this trooS oI our tribe—and who
rules all the tribes and trooSs throuJh the IiJhtinJ instructors we’ve trained
in the weirdinJ way?”
   Paul waited, lookinJ over the heads oI the thronJ. No answer came.
   Presently, he said: “Does  StilJar  rule all  this? He  says himselI that  he
does not. Do I  rule?  Even StilJar  does my biddinJ  on  occasion, and the
saJes, the wisest oI the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council.”
   There was shuIIlinJ silence amonJ the crowd.
   “So,”  Paul said. “Does my  mother rule?” He Sointed down to Jessica in
her black  robes oI  oIIice  amonJ  them.  “StilJar  and  all  the other  trooS
leaders ask her advice in almost every maMor decision. You know this. But
does a  Reverend Mother   walk  the  sand  or  lead  a  razzia  aJainst  the
Harkonnens?”
   Frowns creased the Ioreheads oI those Paul could see, but still there were
anJry murmurs.
   This is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thouJht, but she remembered the
messaJe cylinder and what it imSlied. And she saw Paul’s intent: Go riJht
to the deSth oI their uncertainty, disSose oI that, and all the rest must Iollow.
   “No   man recoJnizes leadershiS without the challenJe  and the combat,
eh?” Paul asked.
   “That’s  the way!” someone shouted.
   “What’s  our Joal?” Paul asked. “To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast,
and remake our  world  into  a Slace where we  may raise  our Iamilies  in
haSSiness amidst an abundance oI water—is this our Joal?”
   “Hard  tasks need hard ways,” someone shouted.
   “Do  you smash your kniIe beIore a battle?” Paul demanded. “I say this as
Iact, not meaninJ  it as boast or  challenJe: there isn’t  a man here, StilJar

477
included, who  could stand aJainst me in  sinJle  combat. This  is StilJar’s
own admission. He knows it, so do you all.”
   AJain,  the anJry mutters liIted Irom the crowd.
   “Many  oI  you have been with me on the Sractice Iloor,” Paul said. “You
know this isn’t  idle boast. I say it because it’s Iact known to us all, and I’d
be Ioolish not to see it Ior myselI. I beJan traininJ in these ways earlier than
you did and my teachers were touJher than any you’ve ever seen. How else
do you think I bested Jamis at an aJe when your boys are still IiJhtinJ only
mock battles?”
   He’s  using the Voice well,  Jessica thought, but  that’s not  enough with
these people. They’ve good insulation against vocal control. He must catch
them also with logic.
   “So,”   Paul  said, “we   come to  this.”  He  liIted   the messaJe cylinder,
removed its scraS oI taSe. “This was taken Irom  a Harkonnen courier. Its
authenticity is beyond Tuestion. It is addressed to Rabban. It tells him that
his reTuest Ior  new trooSs is  denied, that his  sSice harvest is Iar  below
Tuota, that he must wrinJ more sSice Irom Arrakis with the SeoSle he has.”
   StilJar  moved uS beside Paul.
   “How   many oI  you see what  this means?” Paul asked. “StilJar  saw  it
immediately.”
   “They’re  cut oII!”  someone shouted.
   Paul Sushed messaJe and cylinder into his sash. From his neck he took a
braided shiJawire cord and removed a rinJ Irom the cord, holdinJ  the rinJ
aloIt.
   “This  was my  Iather’s ducal siJnet,”  he said. “I  swore never to wear  it
aJain until I was ready to lead my trooSs over all oI Arrakis and claim it as
my riJhtIul  IieI.” He Sut the rinJ on his IinJer, clenched his Iist.
   Utter stillness JriSSed the cavern.
   “Who  rules here?” Paul asked. He raised his Iist. “I  rule  here! I rule  on
every sTuare inch oI Arrakis!  This  is my  ducal IieI  whether the  EmSeror
says yea or nay! He Jave it  to  my Iather and it  comes to me throuJh  my
Iather!”
   Paul liIted  himselI onto his toes, settled back to his heels. He studied the
crowd, IeelinJ their temSer.
   Almost,  he thouJht.
   “There  are men here who will   hold Sositions oI imSortance on Arrakis
when I claim  those ImSerial riJhts which  are mine,” Paul  said. “StilJar  is

478
one oI those men. Not because I wish  to bribe him!  Not  out oI  Jratitude,
thouJh I’m  one oI many here who  owe him liIe  Ior  liIe.  No! But  because
he’s wise and stronJ. Because he Joverns this trooS by his own intelliJence
and not Must by rules. Do you think me stuSid? Do you think I’ll cut oII my
riJht arm and leave it bloody on the Iloor oI  this cavern Must to Srovide you
with a circus?”
   Paul sweSt a hard Jaze across the thronJ. “Who is there here to say I’m
not the riJhtIul  ruler on Arrakis?  Must I  Srove it by leavinJ  every Fremen
tribe in the erJ without a leader?”
   Beside Paul, StilJar stirred, looked at him TuestioninJly.
   “Will   I subtract Irom our strenJth when we need it most?” Paul asked. “I
am your ruler, and I say to you that it is time we stoSSed killinJ oII our best
men and started killinJ our real enemies—the Harkonnens!”
   In  one blurred motion, StilJar had his cryskniIe out and Sointed over the
heads oI the thronJ. “LonJ live Duke Paul-Muad’Dib!”  he shouted.
   A  deaIeninJ  roar Iilled   the cavern, echoed and  re-echoed. They were
cheerinJ  and   chantinJ:   “Ya    hya   chouhada!  Muad‘Dib!    Muad’Dib!
Muad’Dib!  Ya hya chouhada!”
   Jessica translated it to herselI: “Long live the fighters of Muad’Dib!”  The
scene she and Paul and StilJar had cooked uS between them had worked as
they’d Slanned.
   The tumult died slowly.
   When silence was restored, Paul Iaced StilJar, said: “Kneel, StilJar.”
   StilJar  droSSed to his knees on the ledJe.
   “Hand  me your cryskniIe,” Paul said.
   StilJar  obeyed.
   This was not as we planned it, Jessica thouJht.
   “ReSeat aIter  me,  StilJar,”  Paul  said, and he  called  uS the words  oI
investiture as he had heard his own  Iather use them. “I,  StilJar,  take this
kniIe Irom the hands oI my Duke.”
   “I,  StilJar,  take this kniIe Irom  the hands oI my Duke,” StilJar  said, and
acceSted the milky blade Irom Paul.
   “Where my  Duke commands, there shall I Slace this blade,” Paul said.
   StilJar  reSeated the words, sSeakinJ slowly and solemnly.
   RememberinJ the source oI the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook her
head. I know the reasons for this, she thouJht. I shouldn’t let it stir me.

479
   “I   dedicate this  blade to  the cause oI  my  Duke  and the death  oI  his
enemies Ior as lonJ as our blood shall Ilow,” Paul said.
   StilJar  reSeated it aIter him.
   “Kiss  the blade,” Paul ordered.
   StilJar  obeyed, then, in the Fremen manner, kissed Paul’s kniIe arm. At a
nod Irom Paul, he sheathed the blade, Jot to his Ieet.
   A  siJhinJ  whisSer oI awe Sassed throuJh the crowd, and Jessica heard
the words:  “The  SroShecy—A Bene Gesserit shall  show the  way and  a
Reverend Mother shall  see it.”  And,  Irom  Iarther  away:  “She shows us
throuJh her son!”
   “StilJar   leads  this  tribe,”   Paul  said. “Let   no  man  mistake  that.  He
commands with my voice. What he tells you, it is as thouJh I told you.”
   Wise, Jessica thouJht. The tribal  commander must lose no face  among
those who should obey him.
   Paul lowered his  voice, said: “StilJar,  I want sandwalkers out this niJht
and cielaJos sent to summon a Council GatherinJ. When you’ve sent them,
brinJ  Chatt, Korba  and Otheym  and two  other  lieutenants oI  your  own
choosinJ. BrinJ  them to my  Tuarters Ior battle SlanninJ. We must have a
victory to show the Council oI Leaders when they arrive.”
   Paul nodded Ior his mother to accomSany him, led the way down oII the
ledJe and throuJh  the  thronJ  toward the  central SassaJe and the livinJ
chambers that had been SreSared there. As Paul Sressed throuJh the crowd,
hands reached out to touch him. Voices called out to him.
   “My   kniIe Joes where StilJar commands it, Paul-Muad‘Dib! Let us IiJht
soon,  Paul-Muad’Dib!    Let    us  wet    our   world   with    the   blood   oI
Harkonnens!”
   FeelinJ  the emotions oI  the thronJ, Jessica sensed the IiJhtinJ edJe oI
these SeoSle. They could not be more  ready. We are takinJ  them  at the
crest, she thouJht.
   In  the inner chamber, Paul motioned his mother to be seated, said: “Wait
here.” And he ducked throuJh the hanJinJs to the side SassaJe.
   It  was  Tuiet in  the  chamber aIter Paul had  Jone, so Tuiet  behind the
hanJinJs that not even the Iaint souJhinJ oI the wind SumSs that circulated
air in the sietch Senetrated to where she sat.
   He   is  going  to   bring  Gurney  Halleck   here,  she thouJht.   And  she
wondered at the stranJe minJlinJ  oI emotions that  Iilled  her. Gurney and
his music had been a Sart oI so many Sleasant times on Caladan beIore the

480
move to Arrakis. She Ielt that Caladan had haSSened to some other Serson.
In the nearly three years since then, she had become another Serson. HavinJ
to conIront Gurney Iorced a reassessment oI the chanJes.
   Paul’s coIIee service, the Iluted  alloy oI  silver and Masmium that he had
inherited Irom  Jamis, rested on a low  table to  her riJht.  She stared at it,
thinkinJ oI how  many hands had touched that metal. Chani had served Paul
Irom it within  the month.
   What can his  desert woman do for a Duke except serve him coffee? she
asked herselI. She brings him no power, no family. Paul has only one major
chance—to ally himself with a powerful Great House, perhaps even with the
Imperial family. There are marriagable princesses, after all, and every one
of them Bene Gesserit-trained.
   Jessica imaJined  herselI leavinJ  the  riJors  oI  Arrakis  Ior   the liIe   oI
Sower and security  she could  know  as  mother oI  a  royal  consort. She
Jlanced at the thick  hanJinJs  that obscured the rock  oI  this cavern  cell,
thinkinJ  oI how  she had come here—ridinJ  amidst a host oI  worms,  the
SalanTuins and Sack SlatIorms Siled hiJh with necessities Ior the cominJ
camSaiJn.
   As long  as Chani lives,  Paul will  not  see his duty, Jessica thouJht. She
has given him a son and that is enough.
   A  sudden lonJinJ to see her Jrandson, the child whose likeness carried so
much oI the JrandIather’s Ieatures—so like Leto, sweSt throuJh her. Jessica
Slaced her Salms aJainst her cheeks, beJan the ritual breathinJ that stilled
emotion and clariIied  the  mind, then  bent Iorward  Irom  the waist in  the
devotional e[ercise that SreSared the body Ior the mind’s demands.
   Paul’s choice  oI this  Cave oI  Birds as his  command Sost could not be
Tuestioned, she knew. It was ideal. And to the north lay Wind Pass oSeninJ
onto a Srotected villaJe in a cliII-walled sink. It  was a key villaJe, home oI
artisans and  technicians,  maintenance center  Ior  an  entire   Harkonnen
deIensive sector.
   A   couJh sounded outside the  chamber hanJinJs. Jessica straiJhtened,
took a deeS breath, e[haled slowly.
   “Enter,”  she said.
   DraSeries were IlunJ  aside and Gurney Halleck bounded into the room.
She had only time Ior  a JlimSse oI his  Iace with its  odd Jrimace, then he
was behind her, liItinJ   her to  her Ieet with  one brawny  arm beneath her
chin.

481
   “Gurney, you Iool,  what are you doinJ?” she demanded.
   Then she Ielt the touch oI the kniIe  tiS aJainst her back. Chill awareness
sSread out Irom that kniIe tiS. She knew in that instant that Gurney meant to
kill  her. Why? She could think oI no reason, Ior he wasn’t the kind to  turn
traitor. But she Ielt certain oI  his intention. KnowinJ  it,  her mind churned.
Here was no  man to  be overcome easily. Here was  a killer  wary  oI  the
Voice, wary oI  every combat strataJem, wary oI  every trick  oI  death and
violence. Here was an instrument she herselI had helSed train with  subtle
hints and suJJestions.
   “You  thouJht you had escaSed, eh, witch?” Gurney snarled.
   BeIore she could turn the Tuestion over in her mind or try to  answer, the
curtains Sarted and Paul entered.
   “Here  he is, Moth—” Paul broke oII, takinJ in the tensions oI the scene.
   “You  will  stand where you are, m’Lord,” Gurney said.
   “What  ….” Paul shook his head.
   Jessica started to sSeak, Ielt the arm tiJhten aJainst her throat.
   “You  will  sSeak only when I Sermit it, witch,” Gurney said. “I  want only
one thinJ Irom  you Ior your  son to hear it, and I am SreSared to send this
kniIe into your heart by reIle[  at the Iirst siJn oI a counter aJainst me. Your
voice will   remain in  a monotone. Certain  muscles you will   not  tense or
move. You will  act  with the  most e[treme caution  to Jain yourselI  a Iew
more seconds oI liIe. And I assure you, these are all you have.”
   Paul took a steS Iorward. “Gurney, man, what is—”
   “StoS riJht  where you are!”  Gurney snaSSed. “One more steS and she’s
dead.”
   Paul’s hand sliSSed to his kniIe hilt. He sSoke in a deadly Tuiet: “You had
best e[Slain yourselI, Gurney.”
   “I   swore an oath to slay the betrayer oI your  Iather,” Gurney  said. “Do
you think I can IorJet the man who rescued me Irom a Harkonnen slave Sit,
Jave me Ireedom, liIe,  and honor … Jave me  IriendshiS, a thinJ I  Srized
above all else? I  have his betrayer under my  kniIe.  No  one can stoS me
Irom—”
   “You  couldn’t be more wronJ, Gurney,” Paul said.
   And  Jessica thouJht: So that’s it! What irony!
   “WronJ,   am I?”   Gurney demanded. “Let  us  hear it  Irom   the woman
herselI. And let her remember that I  have bribed and sSied and cheated to

482
conIirm this charJe. I’ve even Sushed semuta on a Harkonnen Juard caStain
to Jet Sart oI the story.”
   Jessica Ielt the arm at her throat ease sliJhtly, but beIore she could sSeak,
Paul said:  “The  betrayer  was Yueh.  I  tell  you  this  once,  Gurney. The
evidence is comSlete, cannot be controverted. It was Yueh. I  do  not care
how you came by  your susSicion—Ior it  can be nothinJ  else—but iI  you
harm my mother ….”  Paul liIted  his cryskniIe  Irom  its scabbard, held the
blade in Iront oI him. “… I’ll   have your blood.”
   “Yueh  was a conditioned medic, Iit  Ior  a royal house,” Gurney  snarled.
“He could not turn traitor!”
   “I  know a way to remove that conditioninJ,” Paul said.
   “Evidence,”  Gurney insisted.
   “The  evidence is not here,” Paul said. “It’s in Tabr sietch, Iar to the south,
but iI—”
   “This   is  a trick,”   Gurney snarled,  and his  arm tiJhtened  on  Jessica’s
throat.
   “No  trick, Gurney,” Paul said, and his voice carried such a note oI terrible
sadness that the sound tore at Jessica’s heart.
   “I   saw the messaJe caStured Irom the Harkonnen aJent,” Gurney said.
“The note Sointed directly at—”
   “I   saw it,   too,”  Paul said.  “My   Iather showed  it  to  me the  niJht  he
e[Slained why it had to be a Harkonnen trick aimed at makinJ him susSect
the woman he loved.”
   “Ayah!”  Gurney said. “You’ve not—”
   “Be  Tuiet,”  Paul said, and  the monotone stillness oI  his words  carried
more command than Jessica had ever heard in another voice.
   He has the Great Control, she thouJht.
   Gurney’s  arm trembled aJainst her neck.  The Soint oI  the kniIe  at her
back moved with uncertainty.
   “What  you have not done,” Paul said, “is heard my mother sobbinJ in the
niJht over her lost Duke.  You have not seen her eyes stab Ilame when she
sSeaks oI killinJ Harkonnens.”
   So he has listened, she thouJht. Tears blinded her eyes.
   “What  you  have not done,”  Paul went  on, “is  remembered the lessons
you learned in  a Harkonnen slave Sit. You  sSeak oI Sride in  my Iather’s
IriendshiS!  Didn’t    you  learn   the  diIIerence  between  Harkonnen   and
Atreides so that you could smell a Harkonnen trick by the stink they leIt on

483
it? Didn’t   you learn  that Atreides  loyalty  is  bouJht  with  love while   the
Harkonnen coin is hate? Couldn’t you see throuJh to the very nature oI this
betrayal?”
   “But  Yueh?” Gurney muttered.
   “The   evidence we  have is  Yueh’s  own  messaJe to  us admittinJ   his
treachery,” Paul said. “I swear this to you by the love I hold Ior you, a love
I will  still hold even aIter I leave you dead on this Iloor.”
   HearinJ   her  son,   Jessica marveled  at   the  awareness in   him,   the
SenetratinJ insiJht oI his intelliJence.
   “My   Iather had an instinct Ior his Iriends,”  Paul said. “He Jave his  love
sSarinJly, but with  never an error. His  weakness lay in misunderstandinJ
hatred. He thouJht anyone who hated Harkonnens could not betray him.”
He Jlanced  at his  mother. “She  knows  this. I’ve   Jiven  her my  Iather’s
messaJe that he never distrusted her.”
   Jessica Ielt  herselI losinJ  control, bit  at  her lower  liS. SeeinJ  the stiII
Iormality  in  Paul, she realized  what these words  were costinJ  him.  She
wanted to run to  him, cradle his head aJainst her breast as she never had
done. But the  arm aJainst her  throat had ceased its tremblinJ;   the kniIe
Soint at her back Sressed still and sharS.
   “One oI  the most terrible moments in a boy’s liIe,” Paul said, “is when he
discovers his Iather and mother are human beinJs who share a love that he
can never Tuite taste. It’s a loss, an awakeninJ to the Iact that the world is
there and here and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you
can’t evade it. I heard my Iather when he sSoke oI my mother. She’s not the
betrayer, Gurney.”
   Jessica Iound her voice, said: “Gurney, release me.” There was no sSecial
command in the words, no  trick  to Slay on his  weaknesses, but Gurney’s
hand Iell away. She crossed to Paul, stood in Iront oI him, not touchinJ him.
   “Paul,”  she said, “there are other awakeninJs in this universe. I suddenly
see how I’ve used you and twisted you and maniSulated you to set you on a
course oI my choosinJ … a course I had to choose—iI that’s any e[cuse—
because oI my own  traininJ.”   She swallowed Sast a lumS  in  her throat,
looked uS into her son’s eyes. “Paul … I want you to do somethinJ Ior me:
choose the course oI haSSiness. Your desert woman, marry her iI that’s your
wish.  DeIy  everyone and  everythinJ  to  do  this.  But  choose your  own
course. I ….”
   She broke oII, stoSSed by the low sound oI mutterinJ behind her.

484
   Gurney!
   She saw Paul’s eyes directed beyond her, turned.
   Gurney  stood in  the same sSot, but had sheathed his kniIe,  Sulled the
robe away Irom his breast to e[Sose the slick Jrayness oI an issue stillsuit,
the tySe the smuJJlers traded Ior amonJ the sietch warrens.
   “Put  your kniIe riJht  here in my breast,” Gurney muttered. “I say kill  me
and have done with  it. I’ve  besmirched my  name. I’ve  betrayed my own
Duke! The Iinest—”
   “Be  still!”  Paul said.
   Gurney stared at him.
   “Close  that robe and stoS actinJ like a Iool,” Paul said. “I’ve had enouJh
Ioolishness Ior one day.”
   “Kill   me, I say!” Gurney raJed.
   “You  know me better than that,” Paul said. “How many kinds oI  an idiot
do you think I am? Must I Jo throuJh this with every man I need?”
   Gurney looked at Jessica, sSoke in a Iorlorn, SleadinJ note so unlike him:
“Then you, my Lady, Slease … you kill me.”
   Jessica crossed to him, Sut her hands on his shoulders. “Gurney, why do
you insist the  Atreides must kill   those they love?” Gently,  she Sulled the
sSread robe out oI his IinJers, closed and Iastened the Iabric over his chest.
   Gurney sSoke brokenly: “But … I ….”
   “You  thouJht you were doinJ  a thinJ Ior  Leto,” she said, “and Ior  this I
honor you.”
   “My   Lady,” Gurney said. He droSSed his chin to his chest, sTueezed his
eyelids closed aJainst the tears.
   “Let  us think oI  this as a misunderstandinJ amonJ old Iriends,” she said,
and Paul heard the soothers, the adMustinJ tones in her voice. “It’s over and
we can be thankIul  we’ll  never  aJain have that sort  oI misunderstandinJ
between us.”
   Gurney oSened eyes briJht with moisture, looked down at her.
   “The   Gurney Halleck  I  knew  was  a man  adeSt with  both  blade and
baliset,” Jessica said. “It was the man oI the baliset I most admired. Doesn’t
that Gurney Halleck  remember how I used to enMoy listeninJ by the hour
while he Slayed Ior me? Do you still have a baliset, Gurney?”
   “I’ve    a  new   one,”  Gurney   said.  “BrouJht   Irom   Chusuk,  a  sweet
instrument. Plays like a Jenuine Varota, thouJh there’s no siJnature on it. I

485
think myselI  it was made by a student oI Varota’s who ….”  He  broke oII.
“What can I say to you, my Lady? Here we Srattle about—”
   “Not  Srattle, Gurney,” Paul said. He crossed to stand beside his mother,
eye to  eye with  Gurney. “Not   Srattle, but  a thinJ  that  brinJs  haSSiness
between Iriends. I’d  take it  a  kindness iI  you’d  Slay Ior  her now. Battle
SlanninJ can  wait  a  little  while.   We’ll  not  be  JoinJ  into  the  IiJht   till
tomorrow at any rate.”
   “I  …  I’ll  Jet my  baliset,” Gurney said. “It’s  in the SassaJe.” He steSSed
around them and throuJh the hanJinJs.
   Paul Sut a hand on his mother’s arm, Iound that she was tremblinJ.
   “It’s  over, Mother,” he said.
   Without  turninJ  her head, she looked uS at him Irom the corners oI her
eyes. “Over?”
   “OI  course. Gurney’s ….”
   “Gurney? Oh … yes.” She lowered her Jaze.
   The  hanJinJs  rustled as  Gurney  returned with  his  baliset.  He  beJan
tuninJ it, avoidinJ  their eyes. The hanJinJs on the walls dulled the echoes,
makinJ the instrument sound small and intimate.
   Paul led  his mother to  a cushion, seated her there with her back to  the
thick draSeries oI the wall. He was suddenly struck by how old she seemed
to him with the beJinninJs oI desert-dried lines in her Iace, the stretchinJ at
the corners oI her blue-veiled eyes.
   She’s tired, he thouJht. We must find some way to ease her burdens.
   Gurney strummed a chord.
   Paul Jlanced at  him, said: “I’ve   …  thinJs that need my  attention. Wait
here Ior me.”
   Gurney nodded. His mind seemed Iar away, as thouJh he dwelled Ior this
moment beneath the oSen skies oI Caladan with cloud Ileece on the horizon
SromisinJ rain.
   Paul  Iorced  himselI  to  turn  away, let  himselI  out  throuJh  the  heavy
hanJinJs over the  side SassaJe. He heard Gurney take uS a tune behind
him, and Saused a moment outside the room to listen to the muted music.

       “Orchards and vineyards, 
       And Iull-breasted houris,  
       And a cuS overIlowinJ beIore me.  
       Why do I  babble oI battles,            
                                                   

486
       And mountains reduced to dust? 
       Why do I  Ieel these tears? 
                
                 
       Heavens stand oSen 
       And scatter their riches;  
       My  hands need but Jather their wealth.  
       Why do I  think oI an ambush,               
       And Soison in molten cuS?     
       Why do I  Ieel my years? 
        
         Love’s arms beckon 
       With  their naked deliJhts,  
       And Eden’s Sromise oI ecstasies.  
       Why do I  remember the scars,    
       Dream oI old transJressions …  
       And why  do I sleeS with Iears?” 
   A  robed Fedaykin courier aSSeared Irom a corner oI the SassaJe ahead oI
Paul. The man had hood thrown back and IasteninJs oI his stillsuit hanJinJ
loose about his neck, SrooI that he had come Must now Irom the oSen desert.
   Paul motioned Ior  him to  stoS, leIt the hanJinJs oI the door and moved
down the SassaJe to the courier.
   The man bowed, hands clasSed in Iront oI him the way he miJht Jreet a
Reverend Mother or Sayyadina oI the rites. He said: “Muad’Dib, leaders are
beJinninJ to arrive Ior the Council.”
   “So  soon?”
   “These are the ones StilJar sent Ior earlier when it  was thouJht ….”  He
shruJJed.
   “I  see.” Paul Jlanced back toward the Iaint sound oI the baliset, thinkinJ
oI the old  sonJ that his mother Iavored—an odd  stretchinJ oI haSSy tune
and sad words. “StilJar will come here soon with others. Show them where
my mother waits.”
   “I  will  wait here, Muad’Dib,”  the courier said.
   “Yes … yes, do that.”
   Paul Sressed Sast the man toward the deSths oI the cavern, headed Ior the
Slace that each such  cavern had—a  Slace near its  water-holdinJ  basin.
There would be a small  shai-hulud in  this Slace, a creature no more than

487
nine meters lonJ, keSt stunted and traSSed by surroundinJ water ditches.
The maker, aIter emerJinJ Irom  its  little  maker vector, avoided water Ior
the Soison it was. And  the drowninJ  oI a maker was the Jreatest Fremen
secret because it Sroduced the substance oI their union—the Water oI LiIe,
the Soison that could only be chanJed by a Reverend Mother.
   The decision had come to Paul while he Iaced the tension oI danJer to his
mother. No line oI the Iuture he had ever seen carried that moment oI Seril
Irom  Gurney Halleck.  The Iuture—the  Jray-cloud-Iuture-with   its IeelinJ
that the entire universe rolled toward a boilinJ ne[us hunJ around him like
a Shantom world.
   I  must see it, he thouJht.
   His   body  had  slowly   acTuired a  certain  sSice  tolerance that   made
Srescient visions Iewer and  Iewer …  dimmer  and dimmer.  The solution
aSSeared obvious to him.
   I   will   drown  the  maker. We will   see now  whether  I’m   the  Kwisatz
Haderach  who  can  survive  the  test  that   the  Reverend Mothers  have
survived.

488
        And it came to pass in the third year of the Desert War that Paul-Muad’Dib lay alone in the
        Cave of Birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell. And he lay as one dead, caught up
        in the revelation of the Water of Life, his being translated beyond the boundaries of time by the
        poison that gives life. Thus was the prophecy made true that the Lisan al Gaib might be both
        dead and alive.
                                                           —“CollectedLeJends of Arrakis” by the Princess Irulan



 
  CHANI  CAME     uS  out   oI  the   Habbanya    basin  in   the   Sredawn   darkness,
hearinJ   the  ‘thoSter   that   had  brouJht   her  Irom   the  south   Jo  whir-whirrinJ
oII  to a  hidinJ   Slace in  the  vastness.  Around   her,  the  escort  keSt its  distance,
IanninJ   out  into  the  rocks  oI  the  ridJe   to Srobe  Ior   danJers—and   JivinJ    the
mate  oI  Muad’Dib,    the  mother   oI  his  Iirstborn,    the  thinJ   she had  reTuested:
a moment  to  walk   alone.
    Why  did  he  summon  me?  she asked  herselI.   He told   me before   that  I  must
remain  in  the  south  with  little   Leto  and  Alia.
    She Jathered   her  robe  and leaSed  liJhtly    uS across  a barrier   rock  and onto
the   climbinJ     Sath   that    only    the   desert-trained     could    recoJnize     in   the
darkness.  Pebbles   slithered   underIoot    and  she  danced   across  them  without
considerinJ   the  nimbleness   reTuired.
    The   climb   was   e[hilaratinJ,      easinJ  the   Iears  that   had  Iermented    in  her
because   oI   her   escort’s    silent   withdrawal      and   the   Iact   that    a  Srecious
‘thoSter   had  been  sent  Ior  her.  She  Ielt  the  inner   leaSinJ   at  the nearness   oI
reunion  with   Paul-Muad’Dib,      her  Usul.   His  name  miJht   be a battle   cry  over
all  the land:   “Muad‘Dib!      Muad’Dib!      Muad’Dib!”      But   she knew   a diIIerent
man by  a diIIerent    name—the   Iather  oI  her  son,  the tender  lover.
    A  Jreat   IiJure   loomed    out  oI  the  rocks   above   her,  beckoninJ    Ior  sSeed.
She  Tuickened   her  Sace.  Dawn   birds   already   were   callinJ    and  liItinJ     into
the sky.  A  dim  sSread  oI  liJht   Jrew  across  the eastern  horizon.
    The  IiJure   above  was  not  one  oI  her  own  escort.  Otheym?   she  wondered,
markinJ    a   Iamiliarity      oI   movement    and   manner.   She   came   uS   to  him,
recoJnized    in   the  JrowinJ     liJht    the  broad,   Ilat    Ieatures   oI   the  Fedaykin
lieutenant,   his  hood  oSen  and  mouth  Iilter    loosely   Iastened  the  way  one  did
sometimes  when   venturinJ   out  on  the  desert Ior   only  a moment.
    “Hurry,”     he hissed,   and  led  her  down   the secret   crevasse  into  the  hidden
cave.  “It   will    be liJht    soon,”   he  whisSered   as  he  held  a  doorseal   oSen  Ior

489
her. “The Harkonnens have been makinJ desSeration Satrols over some oI
this reJion. We dare not chance discovery now.”
   They  emerJed into   the narrow  side-SassaJe entrance to the  Cave oI
Birds. GlowJlobes came aliJht. Otheym Sressed Sast her, said: “Follow me.
Quickly, now.”
   They   sSed down  the  SassaJe, throuJh  another  valve  door,  another
SassaJe and throuJh hanJinJs into what had been the Sayyadina’s alcove in
the days when  this  was an  overday  rest cave. RuJs  and cushions  now
covered the Iloor. Woven hanJinJs  with the  red IiJure  oI a  hawk hid  the
rock walls. A low  Iield desk at one side was strewn with SaSers Irom which
liIted the aroma oI their sSice oriJin.
   The  Reverend  Mother  sat  alone directly   oSSosite the  entrance. She
looked uS with the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble.
   Otheym Sressed Salms toJether, said: “I have brouJht Chani.” He bowed,
retreated throuJh the hanJinJs.
   And  Jessica thouJht: How do I tell Chani?
   “How  is my Jrandson?” Jessica asked.
   So it’s  to be  the ritual  greeting, Chani  thouJht, and her Iears returned.
Where is Muad’Dib? Why isn’t he here to greet me?
   “He  is healthy and haSSy, my mother,” Chani said. “I leIt him  with  Alia
in the care oI Harah.”
   My  mother, Jessica thouJht. Yes, she has the  right  to  call  me that  in
theformal greeting. She has given me a grandson.
   “I  hear a JiIt oI cloth has been sent Irom Coanua sietch,” Jessica said.
   “It  is lovely  cloth,” Chani said.
   “Does Alia  send a messaJe?”
   “No  messaJe. But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the SeoSle
are beJinninJ to acceSt the miracle oI her status.”
   Why  does she drag  this  out  so? Chani  wondered. Something was so
urgent  that  they  sent  a  ’thopter   for  me.  Now,  we  drag   through  the
formalities!
   “We  must have some oI the new cloth cut into Jarments Ior little  Leto,”
Jessica said.
   “Whatever  you wish, my mother,” Chani said. She lowered her Jaze. “Is
there news oI battles?” She held her Iace e[Sressionless that Jessica miJht
not see the betrayal—that this was a Tuestion about Paul Muad’Dib.

   “New  victories,”  Jessica said. “Rabban has sent cautious overtures about
a truce. His messenJers have been returned without their water. Rabban has
even liJhtened the burdens oI the SeoSle in some oI the sink villaJes. But
he is too late. The SeoSle know he does it out oI Iear oI us.”
   “Thus  it Joes as Muad’Dib said,” Chani said. She stared at Jessica, tryinJ
to keeS her  Iears to  herselI.  I  have  spoken his name,  but  she has not
responded. One cannot see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face …
but she is too frozen. Why is she so still? What has happened to my Usul?
   “I  wish we were in  the south,” Jessica said. “The oases were so beautiIul
when we  leIt.  Do  you  not  lonJ  Ior  the day  when  the whole  land  may
blossom thus?”
   “The  land is beautiIul, true,” Chani said. “But there is much JrieI in it.”
   “GrieI  is the Srice oI victory,” Jessica said.
   Is  she preparing me for grief? Chani asked herselI. She said: “There are
so many women without men. There was Mealousy when it was learned that
I’d been summoned north.”
   “I  summoned you,” Jessica said.
   Chani Ielt her heart hammerinJ. She wanted to claS her hands to her ears,
IearIul  oI  what  they  miJht   hear. Still,   she keSt her  voice  even:  “The
messaJe was siJned Muad’Dib.”
   “I  siJned it thus in the Sresence oI his lieutenants,” Jessica said. “It was a
subterIuJe oI necessity.” And Jessica thouJht: This is a brave  woman, my
Paul’s. She holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her.
Yes. She may be the one we need now.
   Only  the sliJhtest tone oI resiJnation creSt into Chani’s voice as she said:
“Now you may say the thinJ that must be said.”
   “You  were needed here to helS me revive  Paul,” Jessica said. And she
thouJht: There!  I  said it  in  the  precisely correct  way. Revive.  Thus she
knows Paul is alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.
   Chani took  only a moment to calm herselI, then: “What  is it I  may do?”
She wanted to leaS at Jessica, shake her and scream: “Take me to him!” But
she waited silently Ior the answer.
   “I  susSect,” Jessica said, “that the Harkonnens have manaJed to send an
aJent amonJ us to Soison Paul. It’s the only e[Slanation that seems to Iit. A
most unusual Soison. I’ve   e[amined  his blood  in  the  most subtle  ways
without detectinJ it.”

491
   Chani  thrust  herselI Iorward  onto  her knees. “Poison?  Is  he in  Sain?
Could I ….”
   “He  is unconscious,” Jessica said. “The Srocesses oI his liIe are so low
that they can be detected only with the most reIined techniTues. I shudder to
think what could have haSSened had I not been the one to discover him. He
aSSears dead to the untrained eye.”
   “You  have reasons other than courtesy Ior summoninJ me,” Chani said.
“I  know  you, Reverend Mother. What  is  it  you think  I  may do  that you
cannot do?”
   She is  brave, lovely  and, ah-h-h,  so perceptive, Jessica thouJht. She’d
have made a fine Bene Gesserit.
   “Chani,”  Jessica said, “you may Iind this diIIicult  to believe, but I do not
know Srecisely why I  sent Ior you.  It was an instinct  … a basic intuition.
The thouJht came unbidden: ‘Send Ior Chani.’ ”
   For  the  Iirst  time,  Chani saw the  sadness in Jessica’s e[Sression, the
unveiled Sain modiIyinJ the inward stare.
   “I’ve   done all I know to do,” Jessica said. “That all … it is so Iar beyond
what is usually suSSosed as all that you would Iind diIIiculty  imaJininJ  it.
Yet… I Iailed.”
   “The   old  comSanion,  Halleck,”  Chani   asked, “is   it  Sossible he’s  a
traitor?”
   “Not  Gurney,” Jessica said.
   The  two   words  carried  an  entire  conversation,  and  Chani  saw  the
searchinJ, the tests … the memories oI old Iailures that went into  this Ilat
denial.
   Chani  rocked back onto her Ieet, stood uS, smoothed her desert-stained
robe. “Take me to him,” she said.
   Jessica arose, turned throuJh hanJinJs on the leIt wall.
   Chani  Iollowed,  Iound  herselI in  what had  been a storeroom, its  rock
walls  concealed now  beneath heavy draSeries. Paul lay  on  a  Iield  Sad
aJainst the Iar wall. A  sinJle JlowJlobe  above him illuminated his Iace. A
black robe covered him to  the chest, leavinJ his  arms outside it stretched
alonJ his  sides. He  aSSeared to be unclothed under  the robe.  The skin
e[Sosed looked wa[en, riJid. There was no visible movement to him.
   Chani  suSSressed the desire to dash Iorward, throw herselI across him.
She Iound her thouJhts, instead, JoinJ to her son—Leto. And she realized
in  this  instant  that  Jessica once  had Iaced  such  a  moment—her  man

492
threatened by death, Iorced in  her own  mind  to  consider what miJht  be
done to save a younJ son. The realization Iormed a sudden bond with the
older woman so  that Chani  reached out and clasSed Jessica’s hand. The
answerinJ JriS was SainIul in its intensity.
   “He  lives,”  Jessica said. “I assure you he lives. But the thread oI his liIe
is so thin it could easily escaSe detection. There are some amonJ the leaders
already mutterinJ that the mother sSeaks and not the Reverend Mother, that
my son is truly dead and I do not want to Jive uS his water to the tribe.”
   “How  lonJ has he been this way?” Chani asked. She disenJaJed her hand
Irom Jessica’s, moved Iarther into the room.
   “Three  weeks,” Jessica said. “I sSent almost a week tryinJ to revive him.
There were meetinJs, arJuments … investiJations. Then I sent Ior you. The
Fedaykin obey my orders, else I miJht not have been able to delay the ….”
She wet her liSs with her tonJue, watchinJ Chani cross to Paul.
   Chani stood over him now, lookinJ  down on the soIt beard oI youth that
Iramed his Iace, tracinJ with  her eyes the hiJh  browline,  the stronJ nose,
the shuttered eyes—the Ieatures so SeaceIul in this riJid reSose.
   “How  does he take nourishment?” Chani asked.
   “The  demands oI  his  Ilesh are  so sliJht  he  does not yet  need Iood,”
Jessica said.
   “How  many know oI what has haSSened?” Chani asked.
   “Only   his closest advisers, a Iew  oI  the leaders, the  Fedaykin and, oI
course, whoever administered the Soison.”
   “There is no clue to the Soisoner?”
   “And  it’s not Ior want oI  investiJatinJ,” Jessica said.
   “What  do the Fedaykin say?” Chani asked.
   “They  believe Paul is in a sacred trance, JatherinJ his holy Sowers beIore
the Iinal battles. This is a thouJht I’ve cultivated.”
   Chani  lowered herselI to her knees beside the Sad, bent close to Paul’s
Iace. She sensed an immediate diIIerence in the air about his Iace … but it
was only the sSice, the ubiTuitous sSice whose odor Sermeated everythinJ
in Fremen liIe. Still ….
   “You  were  not born  to the  sSice as we were,”  Chani said. “Have  you
investiJated the Sossibility  that  his  body has  rebelled aJainst too  much
sSice in his diet?”
   “AllerJy   reactions are all neJative,” Jessica said.

493
   She closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because oI sudden
realization oI  IatiJue.  How  long  have  I  been without  sleep?  she asked
herselI. Too long.
   “When  you  chanJe the Water  oI  LiIe,”  Chani  said, “you  do  it  within
yourselI by the inward awareness. Have you used this awareness to test his
blood?”
   “Normal   Fremen blood,”  Jessica said. “ComSletely adaSted to the diet
and the liIe here.”
   Chani  sat back  on her  heels, submerJinJ  her Iears in  thouJht  as she
studied Paul’s Iace. This  was a trick   she had learned Irom  watchinJ the
Reverend  Mothers.  Time   could   be   made  to   serve  the   mind.   One
concentrated the entire attention.
   Presently, Chani said: “Is there a maker here?”
   “There  are  several,” Jessica said with  a  touch oI  weariness. “We  are
never without  them these days. Each  victory  reTuires its  blessinJ. Each
ceremony beIore a raid—”
   “But   Paul Muad’Dib   has held  himselI  alooI  Irom  these ceremonies,”
Chani said.
   Jessica nodded to  herselI, rememberinJ  her son’s  ambivalent IeelinJs
toward the sSice druJ and the Srescient awareness it SreciSitated.
   “How  did you know this?” Jessica asked.
   “It  is sSoken.”
   “Too  much is sSoken,” Jessica said bitterly.
   “Get  me the raw Water oI the maker,” Chani said.
   Jessica stiIIened at the tone oI command in Chani’s voice, then observed
the intense concentration in the younJer woman and said: “At  once.”  She
went out throuJh the hanJinJs to send a waterman.
   Chani sat starinJ at Paul. If  he has tried to do this, she thouJht. And it’s
the sort of thing he might try ….
   Jessica knelt beside Chani, holdinJ out a Slain camS ewer. The charJed
odor oI the Soison was sharS in Chani’s nostrils. She diSSed a IinJer in the
Iluid, held the IinJer close to Paul’s nose.
   The  skin  alonJ  the  bridJe  oI  his  nose wrinkled  sliJhtly.   Slowly,  the
nostrils Ilared.
   Jessica JasSed.
   Chani touched the damSened IinJer to Paul’s uSSer liS.
   He drew in a lonJ, sobbinJ breath.

494
   “What  is this?” Jessica demanded.
   “Be  still,”   Chani said. “You must  convert a small amount oI  the sacred
water. Quickly!”
   Without  TuestioninJ, because she recoJnized the tone oI  awareness in
Chani’s voice, Jessica liIted the ewer to her mouth, drew in a small siS.
   Paul’s eyes Ilew oSen. He stared uSward at Chani.
   “It  is  not necessary Ior her to chanJe the Water,” he said. His voice was
weak, but steady.
   Jessica, a  siS  oI  the  Iluid   on  her  tonJue, Iound   her body   rallyinJ,
convertinJ  the  Soison almost  automatically.  In   the  liJht   elevation  the
ceremony always imSarted, she sensed the liIe-Jlow Irom Paul—a radiation
there reJisterinJ on her senses.
   In  that instant, she knew.
   “You  drank the sacred water!” she blurted.
   “One droS oI it,”  Paul said. “So small … one droS.”
   “How  could you do such a Ioolish thinJ?” she demanded.
   “He  is your son,” Chani said.
   Jessica Jlared at her.
   A  rare smile, warm and Iull oI  understandinJ, touched Paul’s liSs. “Hear
my beloved,” he said. “Listen to her, Mother. She knows.”
   “A  thinJ that others can do, he must do,” Chani said.
   “When  I had the droS in my mouth, when I Ielt  it and smelled it, when I
knew what it  was doinJ to  me, then I knew  I could  do the thinJ  that you
have done,” he said.  “Your  Bene Gesserit Sroctors sSeak oI the Kwisatz
Haderach, but they cannot beJin to Juess the many Slaces I have been. In
the Iew minutes I ….” He broke oII, lookinJ  at Chani with a Suzzled Irown.
“Chani? How  did you  Jet here? You’re  suSSosed to be …. Why are you
here?”
   He tried to Sush himselI onto his elbows. Chani Sressed him back Jently.
   “Please, my Usul,” she said.
   “I  Ieel  so weak,” he said. His  Jaze darted around the room. “How  lonJ
have I been here?”
   “You’ve  been three weeks in a coma so deeS that the sSark oI liIe seemed
to have Iled,” Jessica said.
   “But  it was …. I took it  Must a moment aJo and ….”
   “A  moment Ior you, three weeks oI Iear Ior me,” Jessica said.

495
   “It   was only  one  droS, but I  converted it,”   Paul said.  “I  chanJed the
Water oI LiIe.”  And beIore Chani or  Jessica could stoS him, he diSSed his
hand into the ewer they had Slaced on the Iloor beside him, and he brouJht
the driSSinJ hand to his mouth, swallowed the Salm-cuSSed liTuid.
   “Paul!”  Jessica screamed.
   He Jrabbed her hand, Iaced her with a death’s head Jrin, and he sent his
awareness surJinJ over her.
   The raSSort was not as tender, not as sharinJ, not as encomSassinJ as it
had been with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern … but
it was a raSSort: a sense-sharinJ oI the entire beinJ. It shook her, weakened
her, and she cowered in her mind, IearIul oI him.
   Aloud,  he said: “You sSeak oI a Slace where you cannot enter? This Slace
which the Reverend Mother cannot Iace, show it to me.”
   She shook her head, terriIied by the very thouJht.
   “Show  it to me!” he commanded.
   “No!”
   But  she could not escaSe him. BludJeoned by the terrible Iorce oI  him,
she closed her eyes and Iocused inward-the-direction-that-is-dark.
   Paul’s  consciousness Ilowed   throuJh  and   around her   and  into  the
darkness. She JlimSsed the Slace dimly beIore her mind blanked itselI away
Irom the terror.  Without knowinJ  why,  her whole beinJ  trembled at what
she had seen—a reJion where a wind blew and sSarks Jlared, where rinJs
oI liJht  e[Sanded and contracted, where rows  oI  tumescent white shaSes
Ilowed over and under and around the liJhts, driven by darkness and a wind
out oI nowhere.
   Presently, she oSened her eyes, saw Paul starinJ uS at her. He still held
her hand, but the terrible raSSort was Jone. She Tuieted her tremblinJ. Paul
released her hand. It was as thouJh  some crutch had been removed. She
staJJered uS and back, would have Iallen had not Chani MumSed to suSSort
her.
   “Reverend Mother!”  Chani said. “What is wronJ?”
   “Tired,”  Jessica whisSered. “So … tired.”
   “Here,”  Chani  said. “Sit  here.” She helSed Jessica to a cushion aJainst
the wall.
   The stronJ younJ arms Ielt so Jood to Jessica. She clunJ to Chani.
   “He  has, in truth, seen the Water oI LiIe?” Chani asked. She disenJaJed
herselI Irom Jessica’s JriS.

496
   “He  has seen,” Jessica whisSered. Her mind still rolled and surJed Irom
the contact. It was like steSSinJ to solid land aIter weeks on a heavinJ sea.
She sensed the old  Reverend Mother   within  her  …  and  all  the  others
awakened and TuestioninJ: “What was that? What happened? Where was
that place?”
   ThrouJh  it   all  threaded the realization  that  her son  was the  Kwisatz
Haderach, the one who could be many Slaces at once. He was the Iact out oI
the Bene Gesserit dream. And the Iact Jave her no Seace.
   “What  haSSened?” Chani demanded.
   Jessica shook her head.
   Paul  said: “There  is  in  each oI us  an ancient Iorce  that  takes and an
ancient Iorce that Jives. A man Iinds little diIIiculty  IacinJ that Slace within
himselI where the takinJ Iorce dwells, but it’s almost imSossible Ior him to
see into the JivinJ Iorce  without chanJinJ  into somethinJ other than man.
For a woman, the situation is reversed.”
   Jessica looked uS, Iound Chani was starinJ at her while listeninJ to Paul.
   “Do  you understand me, Mother?” Paul asked.
   She could only nod.
   “These thinJs  are so ancient within  us,” Paul said, “that  they’re Jround
into each seSarate cell oI our bodies. We’re shaSed by such Iorces. You can
say to yourselI, ‘Yes, I  see how such a thinJ may be.’ But  when you look
inward and conIront  the raw  Iorce  oI your  own  liIe  unshielded, you see
your Seril. You see that this could overwhelm you. The Jreatest Seril to the
Giver is the Iorce that takes. The Jreatest Seril to the Taker is the Iorce that
Jives. It’s as easy to be overwhelmed by JivinJ as by takinJ.”
   “And  you,  my son,”  Jessica asked, “are you one who Jives or one who
takes?”
   “I’m   at the Iulcrum,”  he said. “I cannot Jive without  takinJ and I cannot
take without ….” He broke oII, lookinJ  to the wall at his riJht.
   Chani Ielt a draIt aJainst her cheek, turned to see the hanJinJs close.
   “It  was Otheym,” Paul said. “He was listeninJ.”
   AcceStinJ the words, Chani was touched by some oI the Srescience that
haunted Paul, and  she knew  a thinJ-yet-to-be  as  thouJh it   already had
occurred. Otheym would   sSeak oI what  he had  seen and heard. Others
would sSread the story until it was a Iire  over the land. Paul-Muad’ Dib  is
not as other men, they would say. There can be no more doubt. He is a man,

497
yet he sees throuJh to the Water oI LiIe in the way  oI a Reverend Mother.
He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib.
   “You  have seen the Iuture, Paul,” Jessica said. “Will you say what you’ve
seen?”
   “Not   the Iuture,”  he said. “I’ve  seen the Now.”  He Iorced  himselI to  a
sittinJ Sosition, waved Chani aside as she moved to helS him. “The SSace
above Arrakis is Iilled with the shiSs oI the Guild.”
   Jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice.
   “The  Padishah EmSeror himselI is  there,”  Paul said. He looked  at the
rock ceilinJ  oI  his cell.  “With  his Iavorite  Truthsayer and Iive  leJions oI
Sardaukar. The old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is there with  ThuIir  Hawat
beside him and seven shiSs Mammed with every conscriSt he could muster.
Every Great House has its raiders above us … waitinJ.”
   Chani shook her head, unable to look  away Irom Paul. His  stranJeness,
the Ilat tone oI voice, the way he looked throuJh her, Iilled her with awe.
   Jessica tried   to  swallow  in   a  dry  throat,  said:  “For   what  are  they
waitinJ?”
   Paul looked  at her. “For  the Guild’s Sermission to land. The  Guild will
strand on Arrakis any Iorce that lands without Sermission.”
   “The  Guild’s SrotectinJ us?” Jessica asked.
   “ProtectinJ  us! The Guild itselI caused this by sSreadinJ tales about what
we do here and by reducinJ trooS transSort Iares to a Soint where even the
Soorest Houses are uS there now waitinJ to loot us.”
   Jessica noted  the lack  oI  bitterness in   his tone,  wondered at  it.  She
couldn’t doubt his  words—they had that same intensity she’d seen in him
the niJht he’d revealed the Sath oI the Iuture that’d taken them amonJ the
Fremen.
   Paul took a deeS breath, said: “Mother, you must chanJe a Tuantity oI the
Water Ior us. We need the catalyst. Chani, have a scout Iorce sent out … to
Iind a Sre-sSice mass. II we Slant a Tuantity oI the  Water oI LiIe  above a
Sre-sSice mass, do you know what will haSSen?”
   Jessica weiJhed his words, suddenly saw throuJh to his meaninJ. “Paul!”
she JasSed.
   “The  Water oI Death,” he said. “It’d   be a chain reaction.” He Sointed to
the Iloor. “SSreadinJ death amonJ the little makers, killinJ  a vector oI  the
liIe cycle that includes the sSice and the makers. Arrakis will become a true
desolation—without sSice or maker.”

498
   Chani  Sut  a  hand  to   her  mouth,  shocked to   numb  silence  by  the
blasShemy SourinJ Irom Paul’s liSs.
   “He  who  can destroy a thinJ has the real control  oI it,”  Paul said. “We
can destroy the sSice.”
   “What  stays the Guild’s hand?” Jessica whisSered.
   “They’re  searchinJ Ior  me,” Paul said. “Think  oI  that! The Iinest  Guild
naviJators, men who can Tuest ahead throuJh time to Iind the saIest course
Ior the Iastest HeiJhliners, all oI them seekinJ me … and unable to Iind me.
How they tremble!  They know I  have their secret here!” Paul held out his
cuSSed hand. “Without the sSice they’re blind!”
   Chani Iound her voice. “You said you see the now!”
   Paul lay  back, searchinJ the sSread-out present, its limits e[tended into
the Iuture and into  the Sast, holdinJ onto the awareness with diIIiculty   as
the sSice illumination beJan to Iade.
   “Go  do as I  commanded,” he said. “The Iuture’s  becominJ as muddled
Ior the Guild  as it is Ior me. The lines oI  vision are narrowinJ. EverythinJ
Iocuses here where the sSice is … where they’ve dared not interIere beIore
… because to interIere was to lose what they must have. But now  they’re
desSerate. All Saths lead into darkness.”

499
        And that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel poised to spin.
                                                           —from “Arrakis AwakeninJ” by the Princess Irulan


 
  “WILL YOU  look  at that thinJ!”   StilJar   whisSered.
    Paul lay   beside him   in  a slit  oI  rock   hiJh  on  the  Shield  Wall  rim,   eye
Ii[ed   to the collector   oI  a Fremen telescoSe. The  oil  lens was  Iocused on  a
starshiS liJhter  e[Sosed  by  dawn  in the  basin below  them.  The  tall  eastern
Iace oI the shiS Jlistened  in the  Ilat liJht   oI the sun, but  the shadow side still
showed yellow   Sortholes  Irom   JlowJlobes   oI  the niJht.   Beyond  the  shiS,
the city oI  Arrakeen  lay cold  and JleaminJ  in  the liJht  oI  the northern sun.
    It   wasn’t   the  liJhter    that  e[cited    StilJar’s    awe,  Paul   knew,  but   the
construction  Ior  which   the liJhter   was only   the centerSost.  A  sinJle  metal
hutment, many  stories  tall,  reached out in  a thousand-meter  circle  Irom  the
base oI   the  liJhter—a   tent   comSosed  oI  interlockinJ    metal   leaves—the
temSorary  lodJinJ   Slace  Ior  Iive   leJions   oI  Sardaukar  and  His  ImSerial
MaMesty, the Padishah EmSeror Shaddam IV.
    From  his Sosition  sTuattinJ  at Paul’s  leIt,  Gurney  Halleck   said: “I   count
nine levels to  it. Must  be Tuite a Iew  Sardaukar in  there.”
    “Five  leJions,”  Paul  said.
    “It  Jrows  liJht,”    StilJar  hissed.  “We  like  it  not,  your  e[SosinJ  yourselI,
Muad’Dib.   Let us Jo  back into the  rocks now.”
    “I’m   SerIectly saIe here,”  Paul said.
    “That  shiS mounts SroMectile weaSons,” Gurney said.
    “They  believe  us Srotected by  shields,”  Paul  said. “They   wouldn’t   waste
a shot on an unidentiIied  trio  even iI  they saw us.”
    Paul  swunJ  the  telescoSe to  scan  the Iar  wall   oI  the  basin,  seeinJ  the
Sockmarked  cliIIs,   the  slides  that   marked  the  tombs  oI   so  many  oI  his
Iather’s trooSers. And  he had a momentary  sense oI the Iitness oI  thinJs  that
the shades oI those men should  look  down  on this moment.  The  Harkonnen
Iorts and  towns  across the shielded  lands lay  in  Fremen  hands or cut  away
Irom  their  source like   stalks severed  Irom  a Slant  and leIt   to wither.   Only
this basin and its  city remained  to the enemy.
    “They  miJht  try  a sortie by ’thoSter,”   StilJar  said. “II  they  see us.”

500
   “Let  them,” Paul said. “We’ve ’thoSters to burn today … and we know a
storm is cominJ.”
   He swunJ the telescoSe to the Iar side oI the Arrakeen landinJ Iield now,
to the Harkonnen IriJates lined uS there with a CHOAM  ComSany banner
wavinJ Jently Irom its  staII on the Jround beneath them. And he thouJht oI
the desSeration that had Iorced the Guild to Sermit these two JrouSs to land
while all  the others were held in reserve. The Guild was like a man testinJ
the sand with his toe to JauJe its temSerature beIore erectinJ a tent.
   “Is  there anythinJ new to see Irom here?” Gurney asked. “We should be
JettinJ under cover. The storm is cominJ.”
   Paul returned his attention on the Jiant hutment. “They’ve  even brouJht
their  women,”  he  said.  “And   lackeys  and  servants. Ah-h-h,   my  dear
EmSeror, how conIident you are.”
   “Men  are cominJ uS the secret way,” StilJar said. “It may be Otheym and
Korba returninJ.”
   “All   riJht, Stil,”  Paul said. “We’ll Jo back.”
   But  he took  one Iinal  look around throuJh  the telescoSe—studyinJ the
Slain with  its  tall  shiSs, the JleaminJ  metal hutment, the  silent city,  the
IriJates oI  the Harkonnen  mercenaries. Then he slid  backward around a
scarS oI  rock.   His  Slace  at  the  telescoSe was  taken  by   a  Fedaykin
Juardsman.
   Paul emerJed into  a shallow deSression in the Shield Wall’s  surIace. It
was a Slace about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deeS, a
natural Ieature oI the rock that the Fremen had hidden beneath a translucent
camouIlaJe cover. Communications eTuiSment was clustered around a hole
in the wall  to the  riJht. Fedaykin  Juards deSloyed throuJh the deSression
waited Ior Muad-Dib’s command to attack.
   Two  men  emerJed Irom  the  hole by  the  communications eTuiSment,
sSoke to the Juards there.
   Paul Jlanced at StilJar, nodded in the direction oI the two men. “Get their
reSort, Stil.”
   StilJar  moved to obey.
   Paul   crouched with   his   back  to   the  rock,   stretchinJ  his  muscles,
straiJhtened. He saw StilJar sendinJ the two men back into that dark  hole
in  the rock,  thouJht  about the  lonJ  climb  down  that narrow  man-made
tunnel to the Iloor oI the basin.
   StilJar  crossed to Paul.

501
   “What   was  so imSortant  that  they  couldn’t  send a  cielaJo  with   the
messaJe?” Paul asked.
   “They’re  savinJ their birds Ior  the battle,” StilJar said. He Jlanced at the
communications eTuiSment, back to Paul. “Even  with  a tiJht  beam, it  is
wronJ  to  use those thinJs,  Muad’Dib.   They  can  Iind  you  by  takinJ  a
bearinJ on its emission.”
   “They’ll   soon be  too busy to  Iind  me,”  Paul said. “What  did  the men
reSort?”
   “Our  Set Sardaukar have been released near Old GaS low on the rim and
are on their way to  their master. The rocket launchers and other SroMectile
weaSons are in Slace. The SeoSle are deSloyed as you ordered. It was all
routine.”
   Paul  Jlanced across the shallow bowl,  studyinJ his  men in the  Iiltered
liJht admitted by the camouIlaJe cover. He Ielt time creeSinJ like an insect
workinJ its way across an e[Sosed rock.
   “It’ll   take our Sardaukar a little time aIoot beIore they can siJnal a trooS
carrier,” Paul said. “They are beinJ watched?”
   “They  are beinJ watched,” StilJar said.
   Beside  Paul, Gurney  Halleck  cleared  his throat.  “Hadn’t   we  best be
JettinJ to a Slace oI saIety?”
   “There   is   no  such  Slace,”  Paul  said.   “Is   the  weather  reSort  still
Iavorable?”
   “A  Jreat Jrandmother oI a storm cominJ,” StilJar said. “Can you not Ieel
it, Muad’Dib?”
   “The  air  does Ieel  chancy,”  Paul aJreed. “But   I  like  the  certainty  oI
SolinJ the weather.”
   “The  storm’ll  be here in  the hour,”  StilJar  said. He nodded toward the
JaS that looked out on the EmSeror’s hutment and the Harkonnen IriJates.
“They know it there, too. Not a ’thoSter in the sky. EverythinJ Sulled in and
tied down. They’ve had a reSort on the weather Irom their Iriends in sSace.”
   “Any  more SrobinJ sorties?” Paul asked.
   “NothinJ   since the landinJ  last niJht,”  StilJar  said. “They  know  we’re
here. I think now they wait to choose their own time.”
   “We choose the time,” Paul said.
   Gurney Jlanced uSward, Jrowled: “II they let us.”
   “That  Ileet’ll  stay in sSace,” Paul said.
   Gurney shook his head.

502
   “They  have no choice,” Paul said. “We can destroy the sSice. The Guild
dares not risk that.”
   “DesSerate SeoSle are the most danJerous,” Gurney said.
   “Are  we not desSerate?” StilJar asked.
   Gurney scowled at him.
   “You   haven’t lived  with   the Fremen  dream,” Paul  cautioned. “Stil   is
thinkinJ oI  all the water we’ve  sSent on bribes, the years oI waitinJ we’ve
added beIore Arrakis can bloom. He’s not—”
   “ArrrJh,”   Gurney scowled.
   “Why’s  he so Jloomy?” StilJar asked.
   “He’s  always Jloomy  beIore a battle,”  Paul said. “It’s  the only  Iorm  oI
Jood humor Gurney allows himselI.”
   A   slow, wolIish   Jrin  sSread across Gurney’s Iace, the  teeth showinJ
white above the chiS cut oI his stillsuit. “It  Jlooms me much to think on all
the Soor Harkonnen souls we’ll disSatch unshriven,” he said.
   StilJar  chuckled. “He talks like a Fedaykin.”
   “Gurney  was born a death commando,” Paul said. And he thouJht:  Yes,
let them occupy their minds with small talk before we test ourselves against
that force on the plain.  He looked to the JaS in  the rock wall  and back to
Gurney, Iound that the troubadour-warrior had resumed a broodinJ scowl.
   “Worry   saSs the strenJth,”  Paul  murmured. “You   told  me that  once,
Gurney.”
   “My   Duke,”  Gurney  said, “my  chieI  worry  is the  atomics. II  you  use
them to blast a hole in the Shield Wall….”
   “Those  SeoSle uS there won’t use atomics aJainst us,” Paul said. “They
don’t dare… and Ior  the same reason that they cannot risk our destroyinJ
the source oI the sSice.”
   “But  the inMunction aJainst—”
   “The  inMunction!” Paul barked. “It’s Iear, not the inMunction that keeSs the
Houses Irom hurlinJ atomics aJainst each other. The lanJuaJe oI the Great
Convention is clear enouJh: ‘Use oI atomics aJainst humans shall be cause
Ior  Slanetary obliteration.’   We’re   JoinJ  to   blast the  Shield   Wall,  not
humans.”
   “It’s  too Iine a Soint,” Gurney said.
   “The  hair-sSlitters uS there will   welcome any Soint,”  Paul said.  “Let’s
talk no more about it.”

503
   He  turned away,  wishinJ  he actually  Ielt  that conIident.  Presently, he
said: “What about the city SeoSle? Are they in Sosition yet?”
   “Yes,”  StilJar muttered.
   Paul looked at him. “What’s eatinJ you?”
   “I  never knew the city man could be trusted comSletely,” StilJar said.
   “I  was a city man myselI once,” Paul said.
   StilJar  stiIIened. His Iace Jrew dark with blood. “Muad’Dib   knows I did
not mean—”
   “I  know  what you meant, Stil. But the test oI a man isn’t what you think
he’ll do.  It’s what he actually  does. These city SeoSle have Fremen blood.
It’s Must that they haven’t yet learned how to  escaSe their bondaJe. We’ll
teach them.”
   StilJar   nodded,  sSoke in   a  rueIul  tone:  “The   habits  oI  a  liIetime,
Muad’Dib.  On  the Funeral  Plain  we learned  to desSise the men  oI  the
communities.”
   Paul Jlanced at Gurney, saw him studyinJ StilJar. “Tell  us, Gurney, why
were the cityIolk down there driven Irom their homes by the Sardaukar?”
   “An  old trick,  my Duke. They thouJht to burden us with reIuJees.”
   “It’s   been so lonJ  since Juerrillas  were eIIective that  the miJhty  have
IorJotten how to  IiJht  them,” Paul  said. “The Sardaukar have Slayed into
our hands. They Jrabbed some city women Ior their  sSort, decorated their
battle standards with the heads oI the men who obMected. And they’ve built
uS a Iever oI  hate amonJ SeoSle who otherwise would’ve  looked  on the
cominJ battle as no more than a Jreat inconvenience … and the Sossibility
oI e[chanJinJ  one set oI masters Ior another. The Sardaukar recruit Ior us,
StilJar.”
   “The  city SeoSle do seem eaJer,” StilJar said.
   “Their  hate is  Iresh and clear,” Paul  said. “That’s why  we use them as
shock trooSs.”
   “The  slauJhter amonJ them will be IearIul,” Gurney said.
   StilJar  nodded aJreement.
   “They  were told the odds,” Paul said. “They know  every Sardaukar they
kill  will  be one less Ior us. You see, Jentlemen, they have somethinJ to die
Ior. They’ve discovered they’re a SeoSle. They’re awakeninJ.”
   A  muttered e[clamation   came Irom the  watcher at the  telescoSe. Paul
moved to the rock slit, asked: “What is it out there?”

504
   “A  Jreat commotion, Muad’Dib,”  the watcher hissed. “At that monstrous
metal tent. A surIace car came Irom Rimwall  West and it was like a hawk
into a nest oI rock SartridJe.”
   “Our  caStive Sardaukar have arrived,” Paul said.
   “They’ve  a shield around the entire landinJ Iield now,”  the watcher said.
“I  can see the air dancinJ even to the edJe oI the storaJe yard where they
keSt the sSice.”
   “Now  they know  who it is  they IiJht,”  Gurney said. “Let the Harkonnen
beasts tremble and Iret themselves that an Atreides yet lives!”
   Paul sSoke to the Fedaykin at the telescoSe. “Watch the IlaJSole atoS the
EmSeror’s shiS. II my IlaJ is raised there—”
   “It  will  not be,” Gurney said.
   Paul  saw the  Suzzled Irown  on  StilJar’s   Iace, said:  “II   the EmSeror
recoJnized my claim, he’ll  siJnal by restorinJ the Atreides IlaJ  to Arrakis.
We’ll  use the second Slan then, move only  aJainst the  Harkonnens. The
Sardaukar will stand aside and let us settle the issue between ourselves.”
   “I’ve   no e[Serience with these oIIworld thinJs,” StilJar  said. “I’ve  heard
oI them, but it seems unlikely the—”
   “You  don’t need e[Serience to know what they’ll do,” Gurney said.
   “They’re  sendinJ a new IlaJ  uS on the tall shiS,” the watcher said. “The
IlaJ is yellow… with  a black and red circle in the center.”
   “There’s  a subtle Siece oI business,” Paul said. “The CHOAM ComSany
IlaJ.”
   “It’s  the same as the IlaJ at the other shiSs,” the Fedaykin Juard said.
   “I  don’t understand,” StilJar said.
   “A   subtle Siece oI business indeed,” Gurney said. “Had  he sent uS the
Atreides banner, he’d  have  had to  live  by  what  that  meant. Too  many
observers about. He could’ve siJnaled with the Harkonnen IlaJ on his staII
—a Ilat  declaration that’d have been. But,  no—he sends uS the CHOAM
raJ. He’s tellinJ the SeoSle uS there ….” Gurney Sointed toward sSace. “…
where the SroIit is. He’s  sayinJ he doesn’t care iI  it’s an Atreides  here or
not.”
   “How  lonJ till  the storm strikes the Shield Wall?” Paul asked.
   StilJar  turned away, consulted one oI the Fedaykin in the bowl. Presently,
he returned, said: “Very soon, Muad’Dib.  Sooner than we e[Sected. It’s  a
Jreat-Jreat-Jrandmother oI   a  storm  …   SerhaSs even  more  than  you
wished.”

505
   “It’s   my storm,”  Paul said, and  saw the silent awe  on the Iaces oI  the
Fedaykin who heard him. “ThouJh it shook the entire world it  could not be
more than I wished. Will it strike the Shield Wall Iull on?”
   “Close enouJh to make no diIIerence,” StilJar said.
   A  courier crossed Irom the hole that led down into the basin, said: “The
Sardaukar and Harkonnen Satrols are SullinJ back, Muad’Dib.”
   “They  e[Sect  the storm to  sSill too much  sand into the basin Ior  Jood
visibility,”  StilJar said. “They think we’ll  be in the same Ii[.”
   “Tell   our Junners to  set their siJhts  well  beIore visibility   droSs,” Paul
said. “They must knock the nose oII every one oI those shiSs as soon as the
storm has destroyed the shields.” He steSSed to the wall oI the bowl, Sulled
back a Iold oI the camouIlaJe cover and looked uS at the sky. The horsetail
twistinJs  oI  blow  sand could  be seen aJainst the  dark oI  the  sky. Paul
restored the cover, said: “Start sendinJ our men down, Stil.”
   “Will   you not Jo with us?” StilJar asked.
   “I’ll   wait here a bit with the Fedaykin,” Paul said.
   StilJar  Jave a knowinJ  shruJ toward  Gurney, moved to the hole in  the
rock wall, was lost in its shadows.
   “The  triJJer  that blasts the Shield Wall aside, that I leave in your hands,
Gurney,” Paul said. “You will do it?”
   “I’ll   do it.”
   Paul Jestured to a Fedaykin lieutenant, said: “Otheym,  start movinJ the
check Satrols out oI  the blast area. They must be out  oI  there beIore the
storm strikes.”
   The man bowed, Iollowed StilJar.
   Gurney  leaned in  to  the rock  slit,  sSoke to the  man at  the telescoSe:
“KeeS your attention on the south wall. It’ll be comSletely undeIended until
we blow it.”
   “DisSatch a cielaJo with a time siJnal,” Paul ordered.
   “Some  Jround cars are movinJ  toward the south wall,”   the man at the
telescoSe said. “Some are usinJ SroMectile weaSons, testinJ. Our SeoSle are
usinJ body shields as you commanded. The Jround cars have stoSSed.”
   In  the abruSt silence, Paul heard the wind devils SlayinJ overhead—the
Iront oI the storm. Sand beJan to driIt down into their bowl throuJh JaSs in
the cover. A burst oI wind cauJht the cover, whiSSed it away.
   Paul  motioned his  Fedaykin to  take shelter, crossed to the men  at the
communications eTuiSment near the tunnel mouth. Gurney  stayed beside

506
him. Paul crouched over the siJnalmen.
   One said: “A great-great-great Jrandmother oI a storm, Muad’Dib.”
   Paul Jlanced uS at the darkeninJ sky, said: “Gurney, have the south wall
observers Sulled out.”   He  had to  reSeat his  order,  shoutinJ  above the
JrowinJ noise oI the storm.
   Gurney turned to obey.
   Paul Iastened his Iace Iilter, tiJhtened the stillsuit hood.
   Gurney returned.
   Paul touched his shoulder, Sointed to the blast triJJer set into the tunnel
mouth beyond the siJnalmen. Gurney went into  the tunnel, stoSSed there,
one hand at the triJJer, his Jaze on Paul.
   “We  are JettinJ  no messaJes,” the siJnalman beside Paul said. “Much
static.”
   Paul  nodded, keSt  his  eye on  the  time-standard dial  in  Iront   oI  the
siJnalman. Presently, Paul looked at  Gurney, raised a hand, returned  his
attention to the dial. The time counter crawled around its Iinal circuit.
   “Now!”   Paul shouted, and droSSed his hand.
   Gurney deSressed the blast triJJer.
   It  seemed that a Iull  second Sassed beIore they Ielt the Jround beneath
them riSSle and shake. A rumblinJ sound was added to the storm’s roar.
   The  Fedaykin  watcher  Irom  the  telescoSe aSSeared beside Paul, the
telescoSe clutched   under  one   arm.  “The    Shield   Wall   is   breached,
Muad’Dib!”  he shouted. “The storm is on them and our Junners already are
IirinJ.”
   Paul  thouJht oI  the storm  sweeSinJ across the basin, the static charJe
within  the wall  oI  sand that destroyed every shield  barrier in  the enemy
camS.
   “The  storm!” someone shouted. “We must Jet under cover, Muad’Dib!”
   Paul  came to  his  senses, IeelinJ  the  sand needles stinJ  his  e[Sosed
cheeks. We  are   committed,  he  thouJht.   He  Sut  an  arm   around  the
siJnalman’s shoulder, said:  “Leave  the  eTuiSment! There’s more  in  the
tunnel.” He Ielt himselI beinJ Sulled away, Fedaykin Sressed around him to
Srotect him. They sTueezed into the tunnel mouth, IeelinJ its comSarative
silence, turned a corner into a small chamber with JlowJlobes overhead and
another tunnel oSeninJ beyond.
   Another siJnalman sat there at his eTuiSment.
   “Much  static,” the man said.

507
   A  swirl oI sand Iilled the air around them.
   “Seal  oII   this  tunnel!”   Paul shouted.  A  sudden Sressure oI  stillness
showed that his command had been obeyed. “Is the way down to the basin
still oSen?” Paul asked.
   A  Fedaykin went  to look,  returned, said: “The e[Slosion  caused a little
rock to Iall,  but the enJineers say it is still  oSen. They’re cleaninJ uS with
lasbeams.”
   “Tell   them to  use their hands!”  Paul barked. “There  are shields active
down there!”
   “They  are beinJ careIul, Muad’Dib,” the man said, but he turned to obey.
   The siJnalmen Irom outside Sressed Sast them carryinJ their eTuiSment.
   “I  told those men to leave their eTuiSment!” Paul said.
   “Fremen  do  not  like   to  abandon eTuiSment, Muad’Dib,”   one  oI  his
Fedaykin chided.
   “Men  are more imSortant than eTuiSment now,” Paul said. “We’ll   have
more eTuiSment than we can use soon or have no need Ior any eTuiSmert.”
   Gurney  Halleck came uS beside him,  said: “I  heard them  say the way
down is  oSen. We’re very  close to  the surIace here, m’Lord,  should  the
Harkonnens try to retaliate in kind.”
   “They’re  in no Sosition to retaliate,” Paul said. “They’re Must now IindinJ
out that they have no shields and are unable to Jet oII Arrakis.”
   “The  new command Sost is all SreSared, thouJh, m’Lord,” Gurney said.
   “They’ve  no need oI me in the command Sost yet,” Paul said. “The Slan
would Jo ahead without me. We must wait Ior the—”
   “I’m     JettinJ   a   messaJe, Muad’Dib,”     said  the   siJnalman   at  the
communications eTuiSment. The man shook his  head, Sressed a receiver
Shone aJainst his ear. “Much static!” He beJan scribblinJ on a Sad in Iront
oI him, shakinJ his head waitinJ, writinJ… waitinJ.
   Paul crossed to the siJnalman’s side. The Fedaykin steSSed back, JivinJ
him room. He looked down at what the man had written, read:
   “Raid…   on Sietch Tabr …  caStives… Alia  (blank)  Iamilies  oI (blank)
dead are… they (blank) son oI Muad’Dib ….”
   AJain,  the siJnalman shook his head.
   Paul looked uS to see Gurney starinJ at him.
   “The  messaJe is Jarbled,” Gurney said. “The static. You don’t know that
….”

508
   “My   son is dead,” Paul said, and knew as he sSoke that it was true. “My
son is dead … and Alia  is a caStive …  hostaJe.” He Ielt  emStied, a shell
without emotions. EverythinJ  he touched brouJht  death and JrieI. And  it
was like a disease that could sSread across the universe.
   He   could  Ieel   the  old-man   wisdom,  the   accumulation  out  oI   the
e[Seriences Irom countless Sossible lives.  SomethinJ seemed to chuckle
and rub its hands within him.
   And  Paul thouJht: How little  the universe knows about the nature of real
cruelty!

509
        And Muad’Dib stood before them, and he said: “Though we deem the captive dead, yet does
        she live. For her seed is my seed and her voice is my voice. And she sees unto the farthest
        reaches of possibility. Yea, unto the vale of the unknowable does she see because of me. ”
                                                                —from “Arrakis AwakeninJ” by the Princess Irulan



 
  THE  BARON     Vladimir      Harkonnen      stood   with     eyes   downcast    in    the
ImSerial     audience     chamber,     the    oval    selamlik      within      the    Padishah
EmSeror’s   hutment.   With    covert  Jlances,   the  Baron   had  studied   the  metal-
walled   room   and   its  occuSants—the     noukkers,   the   SaJes,  the  Juards,   the
trooS  oI  House  Sardaukar   drawn  uS  around  the  walls,   standinJ   at ease there
beneath  the  bloody    and  tattered   caStured  battle   IlaJs   that  were   the  room’s
only  decoration.
    Voices   sounded   Irom    the  riJht    oI   the  chamber,   echoinJ    out   oI   a  hiJh
SassaJe: “Make   way!   Make   way  Ior  the  Royal  Person!”
    The   Padishah   EmSeror   Shaddam    IV   came   out  oI   the  SassaJe   into   the
audience  chamber   Iollowed    by  his  suite.   He  stood  waitinJ    while   his  throne
was  brouJht,    iJnorinJ    the   Baron,   seeminJly    iJnorinJ     every   Serson  in  the
room.
    The  Baron   Iound   that  he  could  not   iJnore   the  Royal   Person,  and  studied
the  EmSeror    Ior   a  siJn,    any   clue   to  the   SurSose   oI   this   audience.    The
EmSeror   stood  Soised,  waitinJ—a     slim,   eleJant   IiJure   in  a  Jray   Sardaukar
uniIorm   with   silver   and  Jold  trim.   His  thin   Iace  and  cold  eyes  reminded   the
Baron   oI   the   Duke    Leto   lonJ    dead.   There    was   that   same  look    oI   the
Sredatory  bird.   But   the EmSeror’s    hair  was  red,  not  black,   and  most  oI  that
hair  was   concealed   by  a  BurseJ’s    ebon   helmet   with   the  ImSerial    crest   in
Jold  uSon  its  crown.
    PaJes  brouJht    the  throne.    It  was  a  massive   chair   carved   Irom    a sinJle
Siece oI   HaJal   Tuartz-blue-Jreen     translucency   shot   throuJh   with   streaks  oI
yellow    Iire.   They   Slaced  it   on  the  dais   and  the  EmSeror   mounted,    seated
himselI.
    An   old   woman    in   a  black   aba  robe   with    hood   drawn   down    over   her
Iorehead  detached   herselI   Irom   the  EmSeror’s   suite,  took   uS station   behind
the  throne,   one  scrawny   hand   restinJ   on  the  Tuartz   back.  Her   Iace  Seered
out   oI   the   hood   like    a   witch    caricature—sunken       cheeks   and   eyes,   an
overlonJ   nose,  skin  mottled   and  with  SrotrudinJ    veins.

510
   The  Baron  stilled  his  tremblinJ  at  siJht  oI  her. The  Sresence oI the
Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, the EmSeror’s Truthsayer, betrayed
the imSortance oI this audience. The Baron looked away Irom her, studied
the suite Ior a clue. There were two oI the Guild aJents, one tall and Iat, one
short and Iat, both with bland Jray eyes. And amonJ the lackeys stood one
oI the  EmSeror’s dauJhters, the Princess Irulan, a  woman they  said was
beinJ trained in  the deeSest oI the Bene Gesserit ways,  destined to be a
Reverend Mother. She was tall, blonde, Iace oI chiseled beauty, Jreen eyes
that looked Sast and throuJh him.
   “My  dear Baron.”
   The EmSeror had deiJned to notice him. The voice was baritone and with
e[Tuisite control. It manaJed to dismiss him while JreetinJ him.
   The Baron bowed low,  advanced to the reTuired Sosition ten Saces Irom
the dais. “I came at your summons, MaMesty.”
   “Summons!”  the old witch cackled.
   “Now,   Reverend Mother,”  the  EmSeror chided,  but  he smiled  at  the
Baron’s discomIiture, said: “First, you  will  tell me where you’ve  sent your
minion, ThuIir Hawat.”
   The Baron darted his Jaze leIt and riJht, reviled himselI Ior  cominJ here
without  his own  Juards, not  that they’d  be much  use aJainst Sardaukar.
Still….
   “Well?”  the EmSeror said.
   “He  has been Jone these Iive days, MaMesty.” The Baron shot a Jlance at
the Guild aJents, back to the EmSeror. “He was to land at a smuJJler base
and attemSt inIiltratinJ the camS oI the Fremen Ianatic, this Muad’Dib.”
   “Incredible!”   the EmSeror said.
   One  oI the witch’s  clawlike  hands taSSed the EmSeror’s shoulder. She
leaned Iorward, whisSered in his ear.
   The EmSeror nodded, said: “Five  days, Baron. Tell me, why  aren’t you
worried about his absence?”
   “But  I am worried, MaMesty!”
   The  EmSeror continued to stare at him, waitinJ.  The  Reverend Mother
emitted a cacklinJ lauJh.
   “What  I  mean, MaMesty,” the Baron said, “is  that  Hawat will   be dead
within  another Iew   hours, anyway.”  And  he  e[Slained  about the  latent
Soison and need Ior an antidote.

511
   “How   clever oI  you,  Baron,”  the EmSeror said. “And   where are your
neShews, Rabban and the younJ Feyd-Rautha?”
   “The  storm comes, MaMesty. I sent them to insSect our Serimeter lest the
Fremen attack under cover oI the sand.”
   “Perimeter,”  the EmSeror said. The word came out as thouJh it Suckered
his mouth. “The  storm won’t  be much here in the  basin, and that Fremen
rabble won’t attack while I’m here with Iive leJions oI Sardaukar.”
   “Surely  not, MaMesty,” the Baron said, “But error on the side oI  caution
cannot be censured.”
   “Ah-h-h-h,”   the EmSeror said. “Censure. Then I’m not  to sSeak oI how
much time  this Arrakis  nonsense has taken Irom  me? Nor  the CHOAM
ComSany SroIits SourinJ down this rat  hole? Nor the court  Iunctions and
aIIairs oI   state I’ve  had  to  delay—even cancel—because oI this  stuSid
aIIair?”
   The  Baron  lowered  his  Jaze, IriJhtened   by  the ImSerial  anJer.  The
delicacy oI his Sosition here, alone and deSendent uSon the Convention and
the dictum Iamilia  oI the  Great Houses, Iretted him. Does he mean to kill
me? the Baron asked himselI. He couldn’t! Not with the other Great Houses
waiting up there, aching for any excuse to gain from this upset on Arrakis.
   “Have  you taken hostaJes?” the EmSeror asked.
   “It’s  useless, MaMesty,” the Baron said. “These mad Fremen hold a burial
ceremony Ior  every caStive and  act as thouJh  such a  one were already
dead.”
   “So?”  the EmSeror said.
   And  the Baron waited,  JlancinJ leIt  and riJht  at the metal walls  oI  the
selamlik,  thinkinJ   oI   the  monstrous  Ianmetal  tent  around  him.   Such
unlimited wealth  it reSresented that even the Baron was awed. He brings
pages, the Baron thouJht, and useless court lackeys, his women and their
companions-hair-dressers, designers, everything … all the fringe parasites
of  the Court.  All   here—fawning, slyly  plotting,   “roughing   it”   with  the
Emperor … here to watch him put  an end to this affair,  to make epigrams
over the battles and idolize the wounded.
   “PerhaSs you’ve never souJht the  riJht kind  oI  hostaJes,” the EmSeror
said.
   He  knows something, the  Baron thouJht.  Fear sat  like  a  stone in  his
stomach until he could  hardly bear the thouJht  oI eatinJ. Yet,  the IeelinJ
was like hunJer, and he Soised himselI several times in his susSensors on

512
the Soint oI  orderinJ Iood  brouJht to  him.  But there was  no one here to
obey his summons.
   “Do   you  have any  idea who  this  Muad’Dib  could  be?”  the EmSeror
asked.
   “One   oI  the  Umma,  surely,”  the  Baron  said.  “A   Fremen Ianatic,  a
reliJious adventurer. They croS uS reJularly on the IrinJes  oI civilization.
Your MaMesty knows this.”
   The  EmSeror Jlanced  at his  Truthsayer, turned  back to  scowl  at  the
Baron. “And you have no other knowledJe oI this Muad’Dib?”
   “A  madman,” the Baron said. “But all Fremen are a little mad.”
   “Mad?”
   “His  SeoSle scream his name as they leaS into battle. The women throw
their babies at us and hurl themselves onto our knives to oSen a wedJe Ior
their men to attack us. They have no… no… decency!”
   “As  bad as that,” the EmSeror murmured, and his tone oI derision did not
escaSe the Baron. “Tell  me,  my  dear Baron,  have you  investiJated  the
southern Solar reJions oI Arrakis?”
   The  Baron stared uS at the EmSeror, shocked by the chanJe oI subMect.
“But  … well,  you know,  Your MaMesty, the entire reJion is uninhabitable,
oSen to wind and worm. There’s not even any sSice in those latitudes.”
   “You’ve   had  no reSorts Irom   sSice liJhters  that  Satches oI Jreenery
aSSear there?”
   “There’ve  always been such reSorts. Some were investiJated—lonJ aJo.
A Iew  Slants were seen. Many ’thoSters were lost. Much too  costly, Your
MaMesty. It’s a Slace where men cannot survive Ior lonJ.”
   “So,”  the EmSeror said. He snaSSed his IinJers and a door oSened at his
leIt behind the throne. ThrouJh the door came two Sardaukar herdinJ a Jirl-
child who  aSSeared to be about Iour years old. She wore a black aba, the
hood thrown back to reveal the attachments oI a stillsuit hanJinJ Iree at her
throat. Her eyes were Fremen blue, starinJ out  oI a  soIt, round Iace. She
aSSeared comSletely unaIraid and there was a look to her stare that made
the Baron Ieel uneasy Ior no reason he could e[Slain.
   Even the old Bene Gesserit Truthsayer drew back as the child Sassed and
made a wardinJ siJn in her direction. The old  witch obviously  was shaken
by the child’s Sresence.
   The EmSeror cleared his throat to sSeak, but the child sSoke Iirst—a thin
voice with traces oI a soIt-Salate lisS, but clear nonetheless. “So here he is,”

513
she said. She advanced to the edJe oI the dais. “He doesn’t aSSear much,
does he—one IriJhtened old  Iat  man too  weak to  suSSort his own Ilesh
without the helS oI susSensors.”
   It  was such a totally une[Sected statement Irom the mouth oI a child that
the Baron stared at her, sSeechless in sSite oI his anJer. Is it a midJet? he
asked himselI.
   “My   dear Baron,” the EmSeror said, “become acTuainted with the sister
oI Muad’Dib.”
   “The  sist….”  The Baron shiIted  his attention to the  EmSeror. “I do not
understand.”
   “I,  too,  sometimes err on the side oI caution,” the EmSeror said. “It  has
been reSorted to  me  that your   uninhabited south  Solar reJions  e[hibit
evidence oI human activity.”
   “But  that’s imSossible!” the Baron Srotested. “The worms … there’s sand
clear to the ….”
   “These SeoSle seem able to avoid the worms,” the EmSeror said.
   The child  sat down on the dais beside the throne, danJled her Ieet over
the edJe, kickinJ  them. There was such an air oI sureness in the way she
aSSraised her surroundinJs.
   The Baron stared at the kickinJ Ieet, the way they moved the black robe,
the wink oI sandals beneath the Iabric.
   “UnIortunately,”  the EmSeror said, “I only sent in Iive trooS carriers with
a liJht attack Iorce to Sick uS Srisoners Ior TuestioninJ. We barely Jot away
with three Srisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were
almost overwhelmed by a Iorce comSosed mostly oI women, children, and
old men. This child here was in command oI one oI the attackinJ JrouSs.”
   “You  see, Your MaMesty!” the Baron said. “You see how they are!”
   “I  allowed myselI  to be caStured,” the child said. “I did not  want to Iace
my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed.”
   “Only   a handIul oI  our  men Jot away,”  the EmSeror said. “Got  away!
You hear that?”
   “We’d  have had them, too,” the child said, “e[ceSt Ior the Ilames.”
   “My    Sardaukar used  the  attitudinal   Mets on their  carrier   as  Ilame-
throwers,” the EmSeror said. “A   move oI  desSeration and the only thinJ
that Jot them away  with their  three Srisoners. Mark that, my  dear Baron:
Sardaukar Iorced to retreat in conIusion Irom women and children and old
men!”

514
   “We  must attack in Iorce,” the Baron rasSed. “We must destroy every last
vestiJe oI—”
   “Silence!”  the EmSeror roared. He Sushed himselI Iorward on his throne.
“Do not  abuse my intelliJence any lonJer. You stand there in your Ioolish
innocence and—”
   “MaMesty,” the old Truthsayer said.
   He waved her to silence. “You say you don’t  know about the activity we
Iound, nor  the  IiJhtinJ  Tualities  oI  these suSerb SeoSle!” The  EmSeror
liIted himselI halI oII  his throne. “What do you take me Ior, Baron?”
   The  Baron took  two backward  steSs, thinkinJ: It  was Rabban. He has
done this to me. Rabban has ….
   “And   this Iake  disSute with  Duke Leto,”   the EmSeror Surred, sinkinJ
back into his throne. “How beautiIully you maneuvered it.”
   “MaMesty,” the Baron Sleaded. “What are you—”
   “Silence!”
   The  old  Bene Gesserit Sut a  hand on  the EmSeror’s shoulder, leaned
close to whisSer in his ear.
   The  child seated on the dais stoSSed kickinJ her Ieet, said: “Make  him
aIraid some more, Shaddam. I shouldn’t enMoy this, but I Iind the Sleasure
imSossible to suSSress.”
   “Quiet,  child,”  the EmSeror said. He leaned Iorward, Sut a hand on her
head, stared  at  the  Baron.  “Is   it   Sossible, Baron?  Could   you  be  as
simSleminded as my Truthsayer suJJests? Do you not recoJnize this child,
dauJhter oI your ally, Duke Leto?”
   “My  Iather was never his ally,” the child said. “My Iather is dead and this
old Harkonnen beast has never seen me beIore.”
   The Baron was reduced to stuSeIied JlarinJ. When he Iound his voice it
was only to rasS: “Who?”
   “I  am Alia,  dauJhter oI  Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica, sister oI Duke
Paul-Muad’Dib,”  the child said. She Sushed herselI oII the dais, droSSed to
the Iloor oI  the audience chamber. “My brother has Sromised to have your
head atoS his battle standard and I think he shall.”
   “Be  hush, child,”   the EmSeror said, and he sank back  into his  throne,
hand to chin, studyinJ the Baron.
   “I  do not take the EmSeror’s orders,” Alia said. She turned, looked uS at
the old Reverend Mother. “She knows.”
   The EmSeror Jlanced uS at his Truthsayer. “What does she mean?”

515
   “That   child  is   an  abomination!”  the  old  woman  said.  “Her   mother
deserves a Sunishment Jreater than anythinJ in  history. Death!  It  cannot
come too Tuickly Ior  that child or  Ior the one who sSawned her!” The old
woman Sointed a IinJer at Alia. “Get out oI my mind!”
   “T-P?”  the EmSeror whisSered. He snaSSed his attention back to Alia.
“By the Great Mother!”
   “You  don’t  understand, MaMesty,” the old woman said. “Not  teleSathy.
She’s in my  mind. She’s like  the ones beIore me, the ones who Jave  me
their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!”
   “What  others?” the EmSeror demanded. “What’s this nonsense?”
   The  old woman straiJhtened, lowered her SointinJ  hand. “I’ve  said too
much, but  the  Iact remains  that this  child   who  is not  a  child  must  be
destroyed. LonJ were we  warned aJainst such a one and how  to Srevent
such a birth, but one oI our own has betrayed us.”
   “You  babble, old woman,”  Alia  said. “You  don’t  know how  it was, yet
you rattle on like a Surblind Iool.”  Alia closed her eyes, took a deeS breath,
and held it.
   The old Reverend Mother Jroaned and staJJered.
   Alia   oSened her  eyes.  “That  is  how   it  was,”   she said.  “A   cosmic
accident… and you Slayed your Sart in it.”
   The Reverend Mother held out both hands, Salms SushinJ the air toward
Alia.
   “What  is haSSeninJ here?” the EmSeror demanded. “Child, can you truly
SroMect your thouJhts into the mind oI another?”
   “That’s  not how it is  at all,” Alia  said. “Unless I’m  born as you, I cannot
think as you.”
   “Kill   her,”  the old woman muttered, and clutched the back oI the throne
Ior suSSort. “Kill her!”  The sunken old eyes Jlared at Alia.
   “Silence,”   the  EmSeror  said, and  he  studied  Alia.   “Child,   can  you
communicate with your brother?”
   “My  brother knows I’m  here,” Alia said.
   “Can you tell  him to surrender as the Srice oI your liIe?”
   Alia  smiled uS at him with clear innocence. “I shall not do that,” she said.
   The Baron stumbled Iorward to stand beside Alia. “MaMesty,” he Sleaded,
“I knew nothinJ oI—”
   “InterruSt  me once more, Baron,”  the EmSeror said, “and you will  lose
the Sowers oI  interruStion…  Iorever.”  He keSt  his attention  Iocused on

516
Alia, studyinJ  her throuJh slitted lids.  “You  will  not, eh? Can you read in
my mind what I’ll  do iI you disobey me?”
   “I’ve   already said I cannot read minds,” she said, “but one doesn’t need
teleSathy to read your intentions.”
   The EmSeror scowled. “Child, your  cause is hoSeless. I have but to rally
my Iorces and reduce this Slanet to—”
   “It’s  not  that simSle,” Alia said. She looked at the two Guildsmen. “Ask
them.”
   “It  is  not wise to Jo aJainst my desires,” the EmSeror said. “You should
not deny me the least thinJ.”
   “My   brother  comes now,”  Alia  said.  “Even  an EmSeror may  tremble
beIore Muad’Dib,   Ior  he  has the  strenJth oI   riJhteousness and heaven
smiles uSon him.”
   The  EmSeror surJed to his Ieet. “This  Slay has Jone Iar enouJh. I  will
take your brother and this Slanet and Jrind them to—”
   The room rumbled and shook around them. There came a sudden cascade
oI sand behind the throne where the hutment was couSled to the EmSeror’s
shiS. The abruSt  Ilicker-tiJhteninJ   oI  skin  Sressure told oI  a  wide-area
shield beinJ activated.
   “I  told you,”  Alia said. “My  brother comes.”
   The EmSeror stood in Iront oI  his throne, riJht hand Sressed to riJht ear,
the servo-receiver there chatterinJ its  reSort on  the situation.  The Baron
moved two steSs behind Alia.  Sardaukar were leaSinJ to Sositions at the
doors.
   “We  will  Iall back into sSace and reIorm,” the EmSeror said. “Baron, my
aSoloJies. These madmen are attackinJ under cover oI the storm. We will
show them an EmSeror’s wrath, then.” He Sointed at Alia. “Give  her body
to the storm.”
   As  he sSoke, Alia  Iled  backward, IeiJninJ  terror.  “Let  the storm have
what it can take!” she screamed. And she backed into the Baron’s arms.
   “I   have her, MaMesty!” the Baron  shouted. “Shall  I disSatch her  now-
eeeeeeeeeeeh!” He hurled her to the Iloor, clutched his leIt arm.
   “I’m    sorry,  GrandIather,”  Alia  said.  “You’ve   met  the  Atreides  Jom
Mabbar.” She Jot to her Ieet, droSSed a dark needle Irom her hand.
   The Baron Iell back. His eyes bulJed as he stared at a red slash on his leIt
Salm. “You… you….” He rolled sideways in his susSensors, a saJJinJ mass

517
oI Ilesh suSSorted inches oII the Iloor with head lollinJ and mouth hanJinJ
oSen.
   “These  SeoSle are insane,” the EmSeror snarled. “Quick! Into the shiS.
We’ll SurJe this Slanet oI every …. 91
   SomethinJ  sSarkled to his  leIt.  A  roll  oI  ball liJhtninJ   bounced away
Irom the  wall  there, crackled as it  touched the metal Iloor.  The  smell oI
burned insulation sweSt throuJh the selamlik.
   “The  shield!”  one oI the Sardaukar oIIicers shouted. “The outer shield is
down! They ….”
   His  words were drowned in a metallic roarinJ as the shiSwall behind the
EmSeror trembled and rocked.
   “They’ve  shot the nose oII our shiS!” someone called.
   Dust  boiled  throuJh  the  room.  Under  its  cover, Alia   leaSed uS, ran
toward the outer door.
   The EmSeror whirled,  motioned his SeoSle into an emerJency door that
swunJ oSen in the shiS’s side behind the throne. He Ilashed a hand siJnal to
a Sardaukar oIIicer leaSinJ throuJh the dust haze. “We will make our stand
here!” the EmSeror ordered.
   Another  crash shook the hutment. The double doors banJed oSen at the
Iar  side oI   the chamber  admittinJ  wind-blown   sand and  the  sound oI
shoutinJ. A  small, black-robed  IiJure could  be seen momentarily aJainst
the liJht—Alia    dartinJ out  to  Iind  a  kniIe  and,  as beIitted  her Fremen
traininJ,  to  kill   Harkonnen  and  Sardaukar wounded.  House Sardaukar
charJed throuJh a Jreened yellow haze toward the oSeninJ, weaSons ready,
IorminJ an arc there to Srotect the EmSeror’s retreat.
   “Save yourselI, Sire!”  a Sardaukar oIIicer shouted. “Into the shiS!”
   But  the EmSeror stood alone now on his dais SointinJ toward the doors.
A Iorty-meter  section oI the hutment had been blasted away there and the
selamlik’s doors oSened now onto  driItinJ  sand. A  dust  cloud hunJ  low
over the  outside  world  blowinJ   Irom   Sastel distances. Static  liJhtninJ
crackled Irom the cloud and the sSark Ilashes oI shields beinJ shorted out
by the storm’s charJe could be seen throuJh the haze. The Slain surJed with
IiJures in combat—Sardaukar and leaSinJ JyratinJ robed men who seemed
to come down out oI the storm.
   All  this was as a Irame Ior the tarJet oI the EmSeror’s SointinJ hand.
   Out  oI  the sand haze came an orderly  mass oI  IlashinJ shaSes—Jreat
risinJ curves with  crystal  sSokes that resolved into the JaSinJ mouths oI

518
sandworms, a massed wall oI them, each with trooSs oI  Fremen ridinJ to
the attack. They came in a hissinJ  wedJe, robes whiSSinJ in the  wind as
they cut throuJh the melee on the Slain.
   Onward  toward  the  EmSeror’s  hutment  they  came while   the House
Sardaukar stood awed Ior the Iirst time in their history by an onslauJht their
minds Iound diIIicult to acceSt.
   But  the IiJures leaSinJ Irom  the worm  backs were men, and the blades
IlashinJ in that  ominous yellow liJht  were a thinJ  the Sardaukar had been
trained to Iace. They threw themselves into combat. And it was man to man
on the Slain oI Arrakeen while  a Sicked Sardaukar bodyJuard Sressed the
EmSeror back into the shiS, sealed the door on him, and SreSared to die at
the door as Sart oI his shield.
   In  the shock oI comSarative silence within the shiS, the EmSeror stared at
the wide-eyed Iaces oI his suite, seeinJ his oldest dauJhter with the Ilush oI
e[ertion  on her  cheeks, the old Truthsayer standinJ  like  a black  shadow
with her hood Sulled about her Iace, IindinJ at last the Iaces he souJht—the
two Guildsmen. They wore the Guild Jray, unadorned, and it seemed to Iit
the calm they maintained desSite the hiJh emotions around them.
   The taller oI  the two, thouJh, held a hand to his leIt eye. As the EmSeror
watched, someone Mostled the Guildsman’s arm, the hand moved, and the
eye was revealed. The man had lost one oI his maskinJ contact lenses, and
the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost black.
   The smaller oI the Sair elbowed his way a steS nearer the EmSeror, said:
“We cannot know how it will  Jo.”  And the taller  comSanion, hand restored
to eye, added in a cold voice: “But this Muad‘Dib cannot know, either.”
   The words shocked the EmSeror out oI his daze. He checked the scorn on
his tonJue by  a visible  eIIort  because it did not  take a Guild  naviJator’s
sinJle-minded Iocus on the main chance to see the immediate Iuture out on
that Slain. Were these two so deSendent uSon their Iaculty that they had lost
the use oI their eyes and their reason? he wondered.
   “Reverend Mother,” he said, “we must devise a Slan.”
   She Sulled the hood Irom her Iace, met his Jaze with an unblinkinJ stare.
The look that  Sassed between them carried comSlete understandinJ. They
had one weaSon leIt and both knew it: treachery.
   “Summon Count FenrinJ Irom his Tuarters,” the Reverend Mother said.
   The Padishah EmSeror nodded, waved Ior one oI his aides to obey that
command.

519
        He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less
        than a  god, more than aman. There is no measuring Muad‘Dib’s motives by ordinary
        standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted
        the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then?
        Remember, we speak now of the Muad’Dib who ordered battle drums made from his
        enemies‘skins, the Muad’Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the
        hand, saying merely: “I amthe Kwisatz Haderach . That is reason enough.”
                                                                —from “Arrakis AwakeninJ” by the Princess Irulan



 
  IT WAS    to   the   Arrakeen     Jovernor’s      mansion,    the   old    Residency    the
Atreides   had  Iirst   occuSied   on  Dune,  that  they   escorted  Paul-Muad’Dib       on
the  eveninJ   oI   his  victory.    The   buildinJ    stood   as  Rabban   had  restored   it,
virtually     untouched    by   the  IiJhtinJ      althouJh    there   had   been  lootinJ     by
townsSeoSle.   Some  oI  the  IurnishinJs    in  the  main  hall   had  been overturned
or smashed.
    Paul  strode  throuJh    the main   entrance  with   Gurney   Halleck    and  StilJar   a
Sace behind.   Their   escort   Ianned  out   into  the   Great  Hall,   straiJhteninJ     the
Slace  and  clearinJ    an  area  Ior   Muad’Dib.     One   sTuad  beJan   investiJatinJ
that no  sly  traS had  been  Slanted  here.
    “I   remember   the  day  we  Iirst   came  here  with    your  Iather,”    Gurney   said.
He Jlanced   around  at  the beams  and  the  hiJh,  slitted   windows.    “I  didn’t   like
this  Slace then  and  I like   it less  now.  One  oI  our  caves would   be  saIer.”
    “SSoken   like   a true   Fremen,”   StilJar    said,  and  he marked   the  cold   smile
that    his    words     brouJht     to    Muad‘Dib’s        liSs.    “Will      you     reconsider,
Muad’Dib?”
    “This    Slace  is  a symbol,”     Paul  said.   “Rabban   lived   here.   By  occuSyinJ
this  Slace   I  seal  my   victory    Ior   all   to  understand.    Send  men   throuJh    the
buildinJ.     Touch   nothinJ.     Just   be  certain    no   Harkonnen     SeoSle   or   toys
remain.”
    “As   you  command,”    StilJar   said,  and  reluctance   was  heavy  in  his  tone  as
he turned  to  obey.
    Communications     men  hurried    into  the  room   with   their  eTuiSment,   beJan
settinJ  uS  near the  massive   IireSlace.   The  Fremen  Juard   that  auJmented   the
survivinJ    Fedaykin   took   uS stations   around   the  room.  There   was  mutterinJ
amonJ  them,   much  dartinJ    oI  susSicious   Jlances.  This   had  been  too  lonJ   a
Slace oI  the  enemy  Ior  them  to  acceSt their   Sresence in  it  casually.

520
   “Gurney,  have an escort brinJ my mother and Chani,”  Paul said. “Does
Chani know yet about our son?”
   “The  messaJe was sent, m’Lord.”
   “Are  the makers beinJ taken out oI the basin yet?”
   “Yes, m’Lord.  The storm’s almost sSent.”
   “What’s  the e[tent oI the storm damaJe?” Paul asked.
   “In   the direct  Sath—on the landinJ  Iield  and  across the sSice storaJe
yards oI the Slain—e[tensive damaJe,” Gurney said. “As much Irom battle
as Irom the storm.”
   “NothinJ  money won’t reSair, I Sresume,” Paul said.
   “E[ceSt   Ior  the lives,  m’Lord,”   Gurney said, and there  was a tone oI
reSroach in his voice as thouJh to say: “When  did an Atreides worry  first
about things when people were at stake?”
   But  Paul could  only  Iocus his attention  on the inner  eye and the JaSs
visible to him  in  the time-wall  that still  lay across his Sath. ThrouJh each
JaS the Mihad raJed away down the corridors oI the Iuture.
   He siJhed, crossed the hall, seeinJ a chair aJainst the wall. The chair had
once stood in the dininJ hall  and miJht even have held his own  Iather. At
the moment, thouJh, it was only an obMect to rest his weariness and conceal
it Irom  the men. He sat down, SullinJ his robes around his leJs, looseninJ
his stillsuit at the neck.
   “The  EmSeror is still holed uS in the remains oI his shiS,” Gurney said.
   “For    now,  contain   him  there,”   Paul   said.  “Have   they  Iound   the
Harkonnens yet?”
   “They’re  still  e[amininJ the dead.”
   “What  reSly  Irom  the shiSs uS there?”  He Merked his chin toward the
ceilinJ.
   “No  reSly yet, m’Lord.”
   Paul  siJhed, restinJ  aJainst the  back  oI  his chair.  Presently, he said:
“BrinJ  me a caStive Sardaukar. We must send a messaJe to our EmSeror.
It’s time to discuss terms.”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   Gurney turned away, droSSed a hand siJnal to one oI the Fedaykin who
took uS close-Juard Sosition beside Paul.
   “Gurney,”  Paul whisSered. “Since we’ve  been reMoined I’ve yet to hear
you Sroduce the SroSer Tuotation Ior the event.”  He turned,  saw Gurney
swallow, saw the sudden Jrim hardeninJ oI the man’s Maw.

521
   “As   you  wish,  m‘Lord,”   Gurney  said. He  cleared his  throat,  rasSed:
“‘And  the victory that day was turned into mourninJ unto all the SeoSle: Ior
the SeoSle heard say that day how the kinJ was Jrieved Ior his son.’ ”
   Paul closed his eyes, IorcinJ  JrieI  out oI  his mind, lettinJ  it  wait  as he
had once waited to mourn his Iather. Now, he Jave his thouJhts over to this
day’s accumulated discoveries—the mi[ed Iutures and the hidden Sresence
oI Alia within  his awareness.
   OI  all the uses oI time-vision, this was the stranJest. “I have breasted the
Iuture to Slace my  words where only  you can hear them,”  Alia  had said.
“Even you cannot do that, my brother. I Iind  it  an interestinJ Slay. And …
oh, yes—I’ve killed  our JrandIather, the demented old Baron. He had very
little Sain.”
   Silence. His time sense had seen her withdrawal.
   “Muad’Dib.”
   Paul oSened his eyes to see StilJar’s black-bearded visaJe above him, the
dark eyes JlarinJ with battle liJht.
   “You’ve  Iound the body oI the old Baron,” Paul said.
   A  hush oI  the Serson settled over StilJar.  “How  could you  know?”  he
whisSered. “We Must Iound the body in that Jreat Sile oI metal the EmSeror
built.”
   Paul  iJnored the  Tuestion, seeinJ Gurney  return accomSanied by two
Fremen who suSSorted a caStive Sardaukar.
   “Here’s  one oI  them, m’Lord,”  Gurney  said. He siJned to  the Juard to
hold the caStive Iive Saces in Iront oI Paul.
   The Sardaukar’s eyes, Paul noted, carried a Jlazed e[Sression oI shock.
A  blue bruise stretched Irom  the bridJe  oI  his nose to  the corner oI  his
mouth. He  was oI  the blond,  chisel-Ieatured caste, the look that  seemed
synonymous with rank amonJ the Sardaukar, yet there were no insiJnia on
his torn  uniIorm  e[ceSt the Jold  buttons with   the ImSerial crest and  the
tattered braid oI his trousers.
   “I  think this one’s an oIIicer, m’Lord,”  Gurney said.
   Paul nodded, said: “I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that,
man?”
   The Sardaukar stared at him unmovinJ.
   “SSeak uS,” Paul said, “or your EmSeror may die.”
   The man blinked, swallowed.
   “Who  am I?” Paul demanded.

522
   “You  are the Duke Paul Atreides,” the man husked.
   He seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been
SreSared Ior such haSSeninJs as this day. They’d never known anythinJ but
victory  which,  Paul realized, could  be a  weakness in itselI.  He  Sut that
thouJht aside Ior later consideration in his own traininJ SroJram.
   “I   have a messaJe Ior you to carry to  the EmSeror,” Paul said. And he
couched his words in the ancient Iormula: “I,  a Duke oI a Great House, an
ImSerial Kinsman,  Jive  my  word  oI  bond under the  Convention. II   the
EmSeror and his SeoSle lay down their arms and come to  me here I  will
Juard their lives  with my  own.”  Paul held uS his leIt  hand with the ducal
siJnet Ior the Sardaukar to see. “I swear it by this.”
   The man wet his liSs with his tonJue, Jlanced at Gurney.
   “Yes,”  Paul said. “Who but an Atreides could command the alleJiance oI
Gurney Halleck.”
   “I  will  carry the messaJe,” the Sardaukar said.
   “Take him to our Iorward command Sost and send him in,” Paul said.
   “Yes, m’Lord.”  Gurney motioned Ior the Juard to obey, led them out.
   Paul turned back to StilJar.
   “Chani  and your  mother  have arrived,”  StilJar  said. “Chani  has asked
time to be alone with her JrieI.  The Reverend Mother souJht a moment in
the weirdinJ room; I know not why.”
   “My   mother’s sick  with  lonJinJ  Ior a  Slanet she may never see,” Paul
said. “Where water Ialls Irom the sky and Slants Jrow so thickly you cannot
walk between them.”
   “Water Irom  the sky,” StilJar whisSered.
   In  that  instant, Paul  saw how  StilJar  had  been transIormed Irom  the
Fremen naib to a creature oI  the Lisan al-Gaib,  a receStacle Ior awe and
obedience. It was a lesseninJ oI the man, and Paul Ielt the Jhost-wind oI the
Mihad in it.
   I  have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.
   In  a rush oI loneliness, Paul Jlanced around the room, notinJ how SroSer
and on-review his Juards had become in his Sresence. He sensed the subtle,
SrideIul comSetition amonJ them—each hoSinJ Ior notice Irom Muad’Dib.
   Muad’Dib    from  whom  all  blessingsflow,he  thought,  and  it  was  the
bitterest thought  of his  life.  They  sense that I  must  take the  throne, he
thought. But they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad.
   StilJar  cleared his throat, said: “Rabban, too, is dead.”

523
   Paul nodded.
   Guards to the riJht suddenly snaSSed aside, standinJ at attention to oSen
an aisle Ior  Jessica. She wore her  black aba  and walked  with  a hint  oI
stridinJ  across sand, but Paul noted  how this  house had restored to  her
somethinJ oI what  she had once been here—concubine to a rulinJ  duke.
Her Sresence carried some oI its old assertiveness.
   Jessica stoSSed in Iront oI Paul, looked down at him. She saw his IatiJue
and how he hid it, but  Iound no comSassion Ior him. It was as thouJh she
had been rendered incaSable oI any emotion Ior her son.
   Jessica had entered the Great Hall wonderinJ why the Slace reIused to Iit
itselI snuJly in  to her memories. It remained a IoreiJn room, as thouJh she
had never walked here, never  walked here with  her  beloved Leto,  never
conIronted a drunken Duncan Idaho here—never, never, never….
   There should be a word-tension directly opposite to adab, the demanding
memory, she thought.  There should  be a  word  for  memories that  deny
themselves.
   “Where is Alia?”  she asked.
   “Out  doinJ what any Jood Fremen child should be doinJ in such times,”
Paul said. “She’s killinJ  enemy wounded and markinJ their bodies Ior  the
water-recovery teams.”
   “Paul!”
   “You  must understand that she does this out oI kindness,” he said. “Isn’t
it odd how we misunderstand the hidden unity oI kindness and cruelty?”
   Jessica Jlared at her son, shocked by the SroIound chanJe in him. Was it
his child’s  death  did  this? she  wondered. And  she said:  “The  men tell
stranJe stories oI you, Paul. They say you’ve all the Sowers oI the leJend—
nothinJ can be hidden Irom you, that you see where others cannot see.”
   “A  Bene Gesserit should ask about leJends?” he asked.
   “I’ve   had a hand in  whatever you are,” she admitted, “but  you mustn’t
e[Sect me to—”
   “How  would  you like to live  billions uSon billions  oI lives?” Paul asked.
“There’s a Iabric  oI  leJends Ior  you!  Think  oI all  those e[Seriences, the
wisdom they’d  brinJ. But  wisdom temSers love, doesn’t it? And  it  Suts a
new shaSe on hate. How can you tell what’s ruthless unless you’ve Slumbed
the deSths oI both cruelty and kindness? You should Iear me, Mother. I am
the Kwisatz Haderach.”

524
   Jessica tried to swallow  in  a dry throat.  Presently, she said: “Once you
denied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach.”
   Paul shook his head. “I  can deny nothinJ any more.”  He looked uS into
her eyes. “The EmSeror and his SeoSle come now. They will be announced
any moment. Stand beside me. I wish a clear view oI them. My Iuture bride
will be amonJ them.”
   “Paul!”  Jessica snaSSed. “Don’t make the mistake your Iather made!”
   “She’s a Srincess,” Paul said. “She’s my key to the throne, and that’s all
she’ll ever be. Mistake? You  think because I’m  what you made me that I
cannot Ieel the need Ior revenJe?”
   “Even  on the innocent?” she asked, and she thouJht: He must not make
the mistakes I made.
   “There are no innocent any more,” Paul said.
   “Tell  that to  Chani,” Jessica said, and Jestured toward the SassaJe Irom
the rear oI the Residency.
   Chani entered the Great Hall there, walkinJ  between the Fremen Juards
as thouJh unaware oI them. Her hood and stillsuit  caS were thrown back,
Iace mask Iastened aside. She walked  with   a IraJile  uncertainty  as she
crossed the room to stand beside Jessica.
   Paul saw the marks oI tears on her cheeks—She gives water to the dead.
He Ielt  a SanJ oI JrieI  strike throuJh  him,  but it  was as thouJh he could
only Ieel this thinJ throuJh Chani’s Sresence.
   “He  is dead, beloved,” Chani said. “Our son is dead.”
   HoldinJ  himselI  under stiII control, Paul Jot  to his Ieet. He reached out,
touched Chani’s cheek, IeelinJ the  damSness oI her tears. “He cannot be
reSlaced,” Paul said, “but there will be other sons. It is Usul who Sromises
this.” Gently, he moved her aside, Jestured to StilJar.
   “Muad’Dib,”   StilJar said.
   “They  come Irom  the shiS, the EmSeror and his  SeoSle,” Paul said. “I
will  stand here. Assemble the caStives in an oSen sSace in the center oI the
room. They  will   be keSt  at a  distance oI  ten meters  Irom  me unless I
command otherwise.”
   “As  you command, Muad’Dib.”
   As  StilJar  turned  to  obey, Paul heard the  awed mutterinJ  oI  Fremen
Juards: “You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!”
   The EmSeror’s entouraJe could be heard aSSroachinJ now, his Sardaukar
humminJ one oI their marchinJ tunes to keeS uS their sSirits. There came a

525
murmur oI  voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck Sassed throuJh the
Juard, crossed to conIer with StilJar,  then moved to Paul’s side, a stranJe
look in his eyes.
   Will  I  lose Gurney, too? Paul wondered. The way I lost Stilgar —losing
afriendto gain a creature?
   “They  have no throwinJ weaSons,” Gurney said. “I’ve made sure oI that
myselI.”  He Jlanced around the room,  seeinJ Paul’s SreSarations. “Feyd-
Rautha Harkonnen is with them. Shall I cut him out?”
   “Leave him.”
   “There’re    some  Guild   SeoSle,  too,   demandinJ  sSecial  SrivileJes,
threateninJ an embarJo  aJainst Arrakis.  I   told  them I’d   Jive  you  their
messaJe.”
   “Let  them threaten.”
   “Paul!”  Jessica hissed behind him. “He’s talkinJ about the Guild!”
   “I’ll   Sull their IanJs Sresently,” Paul said.
   And  he thouJht then about the Guild—the Iorce that had sSecialized Ior
so lonJ that it  had become a Sarasite, unable to e[ist indeSendently oI the
liIe uSon which  it Ied.  They had never dared JrasS the sword… and now
they could not JrasS it. They miJht  have taken Arrakis when they realized
the error oI  sSecializinJ on  the melanJe awareness-sSectrum narcotic Ior
their naviJators. They  could have done this,  lived  their Jlorious  day  and
died. Instead, they’d e[isted  Irom  moment to moment, hoSinJ the seas in
which they swam miJht Sroduce a new host when the old one died.
   The Guild  naviJators, JiIted  with limited  Srescience, had made the Iatal
decision: they’d   chosen always  the  clear,  saIe  course that  leads  ever
downward into staJnation.
   Let them look closely at their new host, Paul thouJht.
   “There’s  also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she’s a Iriend
oI your mother,” Gurney said.
   “My  mother has no Bene Gesserit Iriends.”
   AJain,  Gurney Jlanced around the Great Hall,  then bent close to Paul’s
ear. “ThuIir  Hawat’s with ‘em,  m’Lord.  I had no chance to see him alone,
but  he  used our   old  hand  siJns  to  say  he’s  been  workinJ   with   the
Harkonnens, thouJht you were dead. Says he’s to be leIt amonJ ’em.”
   “You  leIt ThuIir  amonJ those—”
   “He  wanted it  …  and I thouJht  it  best. II  … there’s somethinJ wronJ,
he’s where we can control him. II not—we’ve an ear on the other side.”

526
   Paul  thouJht  then  oI  Srescient JlimSses into  the  Sossibilities oI  this
moment—and one time-line where ThuIir carried a Soisoned needle which
the EmSeror commanded he use aJainst “this uSstart Duke.”
   The  entrance Juards steSSed aside, Iormed a short corridor  oI  lances.
There came a murmurous swish oI Jarments, Ieet rasSinJ the sand that had
driIted into the Residency.
   The  Padishah EmSeror Shaddam IV  led  his SeoSle into  the hall.  His
burseJ helmet had been lost  and the  red hair  stood out  in  disarray. His
uniIorm’s leIt sleeve had been riSSed alonJ the inner seam. He was beltless
and without weaSons, but his Sresence moved with him like a Iorce-shield
bubble that keSt his immediate area oSen.
   A  Fremen lance droSSed across his Sath, stoSSed him where Paul had
ordered. The others bunched uS behind, a montaJe oI color, oI shuIIlinJ and
oI starinJ Iaces.
   Paul  sweSt his  Jaze across the JrouS,  saw women  who  hid  siJns oI
weeSinJ, saw the lackeys  who had  come to enMoy Jrandstand seats at a
Sardaukar victory and now stood choked to silence by deIeat. Paul saw the
bird-briJht  eyes oI   the Reverend  Mother  Gaius Helen  Mohiam  JlarinJ
beneath her black hood,  and beside her the  narrow Iurtiveness oI  Feyd-
Rautha Harkonnen.
   There’s a face time betrayed to me, Paul thouJht.
   He  looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then, attracted by  a movement, seeinJ
there a narrow, weaselish Iace he’d never beIore encountered—not in time
or out oI it. It was a Iace he Ielt he should know and the IeelinJ carried with
it a marker oI Iear.
   Why should I fear that man? he wondered.
   He  leaned toward his  mother, whisSered: “That  man to the  leIt  oI  the
Reverend Mother, the evil-lookinJ one—who is that?”
   Jessica looked, recoJnizinJ  the Iace Irom  her  Duke’s dossiers. “Count
FenrinJ,”  she said.  “The  one  who  was here  immediately  beIore us.  A
Jenetic-eunuch … and a killer.”
   The Emperor’s errand  boy, Paul thouJht. And  the thouJht  was a shock
crashinJ across his  consciousness because he had seen the EmSeror in
uncounted associations sSread throuJh the Sossible Iutures—but never once
had Count FenrinJ aSSeared within those Srescient visions.
   It   occurred to  Paul then  that  he had  seen his  own dead  body alonJ
countless reaches oI the time web, but never once had he seen his moment

527
oI death.
   Have I  been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills
me? Paul wondered.
   The  thouJht  sent  a  SanJ oI  IorebodinJ  throuJh  him.   He  Iorced  his
attention away Irom FenrinJ, looked now at the remnants oI Sardaukar men
and oIIicers,  the bitterness on  their Iaces and  the desSeration. Here and
there amonJ them, Iaces cauJht Paul’s attention brieIly: Sardaukar oIIicers
measurinJ the SreSarations within this room, SlanninJ and scheminJ yet Ior
a way to turn deIeat into victory.
   Paul’s attention came at last to a tall blonde woman, Jreen-eyed, a Iace oI
Satrician beauty, classic  in  its  hauteur, untouched  by  tears, comSletely
undeIeated. Without beinJ told  it,  Paul  knew her—Princess Royal, Bene
Gesserit-trained, a Iace that time vision  had shown him  in many  asSects:
Irulan.
   There’s my key, he thouJht.
   Then  he  saw  movement  in  the  clustered SeoSle, a  Iace  and  IiJure
emerJed—ThuIir Hawat, the seamed old Ieatures with darkly  stained liSs,
the hunched shoulders, the look oI IraJile aJe about him.
   “There’s ThuIir  Hawat,” Paul said. “Let him stand Iree, Gurney.”
   “M’Lord,”    Gurney said.
   “Let  him stand Iree,” Paul reSeated.
   Gurney nodded.
   Hawat  shambled Iorward  as  a Fremen  lance was liIted   and reSlaced
behind him. The rheumy eyes Seered at Paul, measurinJ, seekinJ.
   Paul steSSed Iorward one Sace, sensed the tense, waitinJ movement oI
the EmSeror and his SeoSle.
   Hawat’s  Jaze stabbed Sast Paul, and the old man said: “Lady Jessica, I
but learned this day  how I’ve  wronJed  you in  my thouJhts.  You needn’t
IorJive.”
   Paul waited, but his mother remained silent.
   “ThuIir,   old Iriend,”   Paul said, “as you  can see, my back is toward  no
door.”
   “The  universe is Iull oI doors,” Hawat said.
   “Am  I my  Iather’s son?” Paul asked.
   “More  like  your  JrandIather’s,” Hawat rasSed. “You’ve his  manner and
the look oI him in your eyes.”

528
   “Yet  I’m  my  Iather’s son,”  Paul said. “For  I say to  you, ThuIir,  that in
Sayment Ior your years oI service to my Iamily you may now ask anythinJ
you wish oI  me. AnythinJ  at  all. Do  you need my  liIe  now, ThuIir?  It  is
yours.” Paul steSSed Iorward a Sace, hands at his side, seeinJ the look oI
awareness Jrow in Hawat’s eyes.
   He realizes that I know of the treachery, Paul thouJht.
   PitchinJ  his voice to carry in a halI-whisSer Ior Hawat’s ears alone, Paul
said: “I mean this, ThuIir. II you’re to strike me, do it now.”
   “I   but wanted to  stand beIore you once more,  my Duke,”  Hawat  said.
And Paul became aware Ior the Iirst time oI the eIIort  the old man e[erted
to keeS Irom IallinJ.  Paul reached out, suSSorted Hawat by the shoulders,
IeelinJ the muscle tremors beneath his hands.
   “Is  there Sain, old Iriend?” Paul asked.
   “There  is Sain, my  Duke,”  Hawat aJreed, “but the  Sleasure is Jreater.”
He halI turned in Paul’s arms, e[tended his leIt  hand, Salm uS, toward the
EmSeror, e[SosinJ   the  tiny   needle cuSSed aJainst  the  IinJers.   “See,
MaMesty?” he called. “See your traitor’s needle? Did you think that I who’ve
Jiven my liIe to service oI the Atreides would Jive them less now?”
   Paul staJJered as the old man saJJed in his arms, Ielt the death there, the
utter Ilaccidity.  Gently, Paul lowered Hawat  to the Iloor,  straiJhtened and
siJned Ior Juardsmen to carry the body away.
   Silence held the hall while his command was obeyed.
   A  look  oI  deadly waitinJ  held  the EmSeror’s Iace now.  Eyes that had
never admitted Iear admitted it at last.
   “MaMesty,” Paul said, and noted the Merk oI surSrised attention in the tall
Princess Royal.  The  words   had been  uttered  with   the  Bene  Gesserit
controlled atonals, carryinJ  in  it  every shade oI contemSt and scorn that
Paul could Sut there.
   Bene-Gesserit trained indeed, Paul thouJht.
   The  EmSeror cleared his throat,  said: “PerhaSs my  resSected kinsman
believes he has thinJs all his own way now. NothinJ could be more remote
Irom Iact. You have violated the Convention, used atomics aJainst—”
   “I  used atomics aJainst a natural Ieature oI the desert,” Paul said. “It was
in  my  way  and I   was in  a  hurry  to  Jet  to  you,  MaMesty, to ask your
e[Slanation Ior some oI your stranJe activities.”
   “There’s  a massed armada oI  the Great Houses in  sSace over Arrakis
riJht now,” the EmSeror said. “I’ve but to say the word and they’ll—”

529
   “Oh,  yes,” Paul said, “I  almost IorJot about them.” He searched throuJh
the EmSeror’s suite until  he  saw the Iaces oI  the two  Guildsmen, sSoke
aside to Gurney. “Are   those the Guild  aJents, Gurney,  the two  Iat  ones
dressed in Jray over there?”
   “Yes, m’Lord.”
   “You   two,”   Paul  said, SointinJ.  “Get   out  oI  there  immediately  and
disSatch messaJes that will Jet that Ileet on its way home. AIter this, you’ll
ask my Sermission beIore—”
   “The  Guild  doesn’t take your  orders!” the  taller oI  the two  barked. He
and his comSanion Sushed throuJh to the barrier lances, which were raised
at a nod Irom Paul. The two men steSSed out and the taller leveled an arm
at Paul, said: “You may very well be under embarJo Ior your—”
   “II  I  hear any more nonsense Irom either oI you,” Paul said, “I’ll Jive the
order that’ll destroy all sSice Sroduction on Arrakis … Iorever.”
   “Are  you mad?” the tall Guildsman demanded. He Iell back halI a steS.
   “You  Jrant that I have the Sower to do this thinJ, then?” Paul asked.
   The Guildsman seemed to stare into sSace Ior a moment, then: “Yes, you
could do it, but you must not.”
   “Ah-h-h,”   Paul said  and nodded to himselI.  “Guild  naviJators, both  oI
you, eh?”
   “Yes!”
   The  shorter  oI   the  Sair  said:  “You  would   blind  yourselI,   too,  and
condemn us all  to  slow  death. Have you  any idea  what it   means to be
deSrived oI the sSice liTuor once you’re addicted?”
   “The  eye that looks ahead to the saIe course is closed Iorever,” Paul said.
“The  Guild  is  criSSled. Humans become little  isolated  clusters on  their
isolated Slanets. You know, I miJht do this thinJ out oI  Sure sSite… or out
oI ennui.”
   “Let  us talk this  over Srivately,” the taller Guildsman said. “I’m  sure we
can come to some comSromise that is—”
   “Send the messaJe to your SeoSle over Arrakis,” Paul said. “I Jrow tired
oI this arJument. II that Ileet over us doesn’t leave soon there’ll be no need
Ior us to talk.” He nodded toward his communications men at the side oI the
hall. “You may use our eTuiSment.”
   “First  we must discuss this,” the tall Guildsman said. “We cannot Must—”
   “Do   it!”   Paul barked.  “The  Sower to  destroy a  thinJ  is  the  absolute
control over it. You’ve aJreed I have that Sower. We are not here to discuss

530
or to  neJotiate or to  comSromise. You will  obey my  orders or  suIIer the
immediate conseTuences!”
   “He  means it,”  the shorter Guildsman said. And  Paul saw the Iear JriS
them.
   Slowly  the two crossed to the Fremen communications eTuiSment.
   “Will   they obey?” Gurney asked.
   “They  have a narrow vision oI time,” Paul said. “They can see ahead to a
blank  wall   markinJ   the   conseTuences oI  disobedience. Every   Guild
naviJator on every shiS over us can look ahead to that same wall. They’ll
obey.”
   Paul turned back to look at the EmSeror, said: “When they Sermitted you
to mount your Iather’s throne, it was only on the assurance that you’d keeS
the  sSice  IlowinJ.   You’ve   Iailed   them,  MaMesty. Do  you   know   the
conseTuences?”
   “Nobody  permitted me to—”
   “StoS SlayinJ the Iool,”  Paul barked. “The Guild is like a villaJe beside a
river. They need the water, but  can only  diS out what  they reTuire. They
cannot dam the river and control it, because that Iocuses attention on what
they take, it brinJs  down eventual destruction. The sSice Ilow, that’s their
river, and I have built a dam. But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it
without destroyinJ the river.”
   The EmSeror brushed a hand throuJh his red hair, Jlanced at the backs oI
the two Guildsmen.
   “Even  your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is tremblinJ,” Paul said. “There are
other Soisons the  Reverend Mothers  can use  Ior  their  tricks,  but  once
they’ve used the sSice liTuor, the others no lonJer work.”
   The  old  woman Sulled  her shaSeless black robes around her, Sressed
Iorward out oI the crowd to stand at the barrier lances.
   “Reverend Mother  Gaius Helen Mohiam,” Paul said. “It  has been a lonJ
time since Caladan, hasn’t it?”
   She looked Sast him  at his mother, said: “Well,  Jessica, I see that your
son is indeed the one. For that you can be IorJiven even the abomination oI
your dauJhter.”
   Paul stilled  a cold,  SiercinJ anJer, said: “You’ve  never had the riJht  or
cause to IorJive my mother anythinJ!”
   The old woman locked eyes with him.

531
   “Try   your  tricks   on me,  old  witch,”   Paul  said.  “Where’s  your  Jom
Mabbar? Try lookinJ into that Slace where you dare not look! You’ll Iind me
there starinJ out at you!”
   The old woman droSSed her Jaze.
   “Have  you nothinJ to say?” Paul demanded.
   “I  welcomed you to the ranks oI humans,” she muttered. “Don’t besmirch
that.”
   Paul raised his  voice: “Observe her, comrades! This is  a Bene Gesserit
Reverend Mother, Satient in a Satient cause. She could wait with her sisters
—ninety Jenerations Ior the SroSer combination oI Jenes and environment
to Sroduce the one Serson their schemes reTuired. Observe her! She knows
now that the ninety Jenerations have Sroduced that Serson. Here I stand…
but… I … will  … never… do … her… biddinJ!”
   “Jessica!” the old woman screamed. “Silence him!”
   “Silence him  yourselI,” Jessica said.
   Paul Jlared  at the old  woman. “For  your Sart in  all  this I  could Jladly
have you stranJled,” he said. “You couldn’t  Srevent it!” he snaSSed as she
stiIIened in raJe. “But   I think  it  better Sunishment that you live  out your
years never able to touch me or bend me to a sinJle  thinJ your  scheminJ
desires.”
   “Jessica, what have you done?” the old woman demanded.
   “I’ll   Jive  you only one thinJ,”  Paul said. “You saw Sart oI what the race
needs, but how Soorly you saw it. You think to control human breedinJ and
intermi[   a  select  Iew  accordinJ  to  your  master  Slan!  How  little   you
understand oI what—”
   “You  mustn’t sSeak oI these thinJs!” the old woman hissed.
   “Silence!”  Paul roared. The word seemed to take substance as it twisted
throuJh the air between them under Paul’s control.
   The old woman reeled back into the arms oI those behind her, Iace blank
with shock at the Sower with which he had seized her Ssyche. “Jessica,” she
whisSered. “Jessica.”
   “I   remember your Jom Mabbar,” Paul said. “You remember mine. I can
kill you with  a word.”
   The  Fremen around the hall  Jlanced knowinJly  at  each other. Did  the
leJend not say: “Andhis word shall  carry death eternal to those who stand
against righteousness. ”

532
   Paul  turned his attention to  the tall  Princess Royal standinJ beside her
EmSeror Iather. KeeSinJ his eyes Iocused on  her, he said:  “MaMesty, we
both know the way out oI our diIIiculty.”
   The EmSeror Jlanced at his dauJhter, back to Paul. “You dare? You! An
adventurer without Iamily, a nobody Irom—”
   “You’ve   already admitted who  I  am,” Paul  said. “Royal  kinsman, you
said. Let’s stoS this nonsense.”
   “I  am your ruler,” the EmSeror said.
   Paul  Jlanced  at the  Guildsmen  standinJ now  at  the  communications
eTuiSment and IacinJ him. One oI them nodded.
   “I  could Iorce it,”  Paul said.
   “You  will  not dare!” the EmSeror Jrated.
   Paul merely stared at him.
   The  Princess Royal Sut a hand on her Iather’s  arm. “Father,”  she said,
and her voice was silky soIt, soothinJ.
   “Don’t   try your tricks  on me,” the EmSeror said. He looked at her. “You
don’t need to do this, DauJhter. We’ve other resources that—”
   “But  here’s a man Iit to be your son,” she said.
   The old Reverend Mother, her comSosure reJained, Iorced her way to the
EmSeror’s side, leaned close to his ear and whisSered.
   “She Sleads your case,” Jessica said.
   Paul continued to look at the Jolden-haired Princess. Aside to his mother,
he said: “That’s Irulan, the oldest, isn’t it?”
   “Yes.”
   Chani  moved uS on Paul’s other side, said: “Do  you wish  me to leave,
Muad’Dib?”
   He Jlanced at her. “Leave? You’ll never aJain leave my side.”
   “There’s nothinJ  bindinJ between us,” Chani said.
   Paul  looked down  at her Ior  a  silent moment, then:  “SSeak only truth
with me, my Sihaya.”  As she started to reSly, he silenced her with a IinJer
to her liSs. “That which  binds us cannot be loosed,” he said. “Now, watch
these matters closely   Ior  I   wish  to  see  this  room  later  throuJh  your
wisdom.”
   The EmSeror and his Truthsayer were carryinJ  on a heated, low-voiced
arJument.
   Paul  sSoke to  his   mother: “She   reminds him   that  it’s  Sart  oI  their
aJreement to Slace a Bene Gesserit on the  throne, and Irulan  is  the one

533
they’ve Jroomed Ior it.”
   “Was that their Slan?” Jessica said.
   “Isn’t  it  obvious?” Paul asked.
   “I   see the siJns!” Jessica snaSSed. “My Tuestion was meant to remind
you that you should not try to teach me those matters in which I instructed
you.”
   Paul Jlanced at her, cauJht a cold smile on her liSs.
   Gurney Halleck  leaned between them, said: “I remind you, m’Lord,  that
there’s a Harkonnen  in  that  bunch.”  He nodded toward  the  dark-haired
Feyd-Rautha Sressed aJainst a barrier lance on the leIt. “The one with the
sTuintinJ eyes there on the leIt. As evil a Iace as I ever say. You Sromised
me once that—”
   “Thank  you, Gurney,” Paul said.
   “It’s  the na-Baron …  Baron now that the old man’s dead,” Gurney said.
“He’ll  do Ior what I’ve in—”
   “Can you take him, Gurney?”
   “M’Lord   Mests!”
   “That  arJument between the  EmSeror and his witch  has Jone on  lonJ
enouJh, don’t you think, Mother?”
   She nodded. “Indeed.”
   Paul  raised his voice,  called  out to  the EmSeror: “MaMesty, is there a
Harkonnen amonJ you?”
   Royal  disdain revealed itselI  in the  way the EmSeror turned to  look at
Paul. “I believe my entouraJe has been Slaced under the Srotection oI your
ducal word,” he said.
   “My   Tuestion was Ior inIormation only,”  Paul said. “I wish  to know iI  a
Harkonnen is oIIicially a Sart oI your entouraJe or iI a Harkonnen is merely
hidinJ behind a technicality out oI cowardice.”
   The   EmSeror’s  smile  was   calculatinJ.  “Anyone    acceSted into   the
ImSerial comSany is a member oI my entouraJe.”
   “You  have the  word oI  a Duke,”   Paul said, “but  Muad’Dib  is  another
matter. He  may   not  recoJnize  your  deIinition   oI   what  constitutes an
entouraJe. My Iriend Gurney Halleck wishes to kill a Harkonnen. II he—”
   “Kanly!”    Feyd-Rautha shouted. He  Sressed aJainst the  barrier  lance.
“Your Iather named this vendetta, Atreides. You call me coward while you
hide amonJ your women and oIIer to send a lackey aJainst me!”

534
   The old  Truthsayer whisSered somethinJ Iiercely into the EmSeror’s ear,
but he Sushed her aside, said: “Kanly, is it? There are strict rules Ior kanly.”
   “Paul, Sut a stoS to this,” Jessica said.
   “M’Lord,”     Gurney   said,  “You   Sromised  me   my   day  aJainst   the
Harkonnens.”
   “You’ve   had your day aJainst them,”  Paul said and he Ielt  a harleTuin
abandon take over his emotions.  He sliSSed his robe and  hood Irom  his
shoulders, handed them to his mother  with  his belt  and cryskniIe, beJan
unstraSSinJ his stillsuit. He  sensed now that the universe Iocused on this
moment.
   “There’s no need Ior this,” Jessica said. “There are easier ways, Paul.”
   Paul steSSed out oI his stillsuit,  sliSSed the cryskniIe Irom its  sheath in
his mother’s  hand. “I   know,”  he  said. “Poison,  an  assassin, all the  old
Iamiliar ways.”
   “You  Sromised me a Harkonnen!”  Gurney hissed, and Paul marked the
raJe in the man’s Iace, the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and ridJed.
“You owe it to me, m’Lord!”
   “Have  you suIIered more Irom them than I?” Paul asked.
   “My  sister,” Gurney rasSed. “My years in the slave Sits—”
   “My  Iather,”  Paul said. “My Jood Iriends and comSanions, ThuIir Hawat
and Duncan Idaho, my years as a IuJitive without rank or succor … and one
more thinJ: it  is now  kanly and you know  as well as I the rules  that must
Srevail.”
   Halleck’s shoulders saJJed. “M’Lord, iI  that swine… he’s no more than a
beast you’d sSurn with  your Ioot  and discard the  shoe because it’d been
contaminated. Call in an e[ecutioner, iI you must, or let me do it, but  don’t
oIIer yourselI to—”
   “Muad’Dib   need not do this thinJ,” Chani said.
   He Jlanced at her, saw the Iear Ior  him in her eyes. “But  the Duke Paul
must,” he said.
   “This  is a Harkonnen animal!” Gurney rasSed.
   Paul  hesitated on the  Soint oI  revealinJ  his own  Harkonnen ancestry,
stoSSed at a sharS look Irom his mother, said merely: “But  this beinJ has
human shaSe, Gurney, and deserves human doubt.”
   Gurney said: “II  he so much as—”
   “Please stand aside,” Paul said. He heIted the cryskniIe, Sushed Gurney
Jently aside.

535
   “Gurney!”    Jessica said.  She  touched Gurney’s  arm.   “He’s  like   his
JrandIather in this mood. Don’t distract him. It’s  the only thinJ  you can do
Ior him now.” And she thouJht: Great Mother! What irony.
   The EmSeror was studyinJ Feyd-Rautha, seeinJ the heavy shoulders, the
thick muscles. He turned to  look at  Paul—a strinJy whiScord  oI a youth,
not as desiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and
sunken in  the Ilanks  so that  the  riSSle and Jather  oI  muscles could  be
Iollowed under the skin.
   Jessica leaned close to Paul, Sitched her voice Ior his  ears alone: “One
thinJ, Son. Sometimes a danJerous Serson is SreSared by the Bene Gesserit,
a  word  imSlanted  into  the  deeSest recesses by  the  old  Sleasure-Sain
methods. The word-sound most IreTuently used is Uroshnor. II  this  one’s
been SreSared, as I stronJly susSect, that word uttered in his ear will render
his muscles Ilaccid and—”
   “I  want  no sSecial advantaJe Ior this one,” Paul said. “SteS back out oI
my way.”
   Gurney sSoke to her: “Why is he doinJ this? Does he think to Jet himselI
killed and achieve martyrdom? This  Fremen reliJious Srattle, is that what
clouds his reason?”
   Jessica hid her Iace in  her hands, realizinJ  that she did not know  Iully
why Paul took this course. She could Ieel death in the room and knew that
the chanJed Paul was caSable oI such a thinJ as Gurney suJJested. Every
talent within  her  Iocused on  the need to  Srotect her  son, but  there was
nothinJ she could do.
   “Is  it this reliJious Srattle?” Gurney insisted.
   “Be  silent,” Jessica whisSered. “And Sray.”
   The  EmSeror’s Iace was touched by  an abruSt smile.  “II  Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen … oI my entouraJe… so wishes,” he said, “I  relieve him oI all
restraint and Jive  him  Ireedom  to  choose his own  course in  this.”   The
EmSeror waved a hand toward Paul’s Fedaykin Juards. “One oI your rabble
has my belt and  short blade. II  Feyd-Rautha wishes it, he may  meet you
with my blade in his hand.”
   “I  wish it,”  Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man’s Iace.
   He’s  overconfident, Paul  thought.  There’s a  natural  advantage I   can
accept.
   “Get  the EmSeror’s blade,” Paul said, and watched as his command was
obeyed. “Put  it  on the  Iloor  there.”  He  indicated a  Slace with  his Ioot.

536
“Clear  the ImSerial  rabble back aJainst  the wall  and  let the  Harkonnen
stand clear.”
   A  Ilurry   oI robes, scraSinJ oI  Ieet, low-voiced  commands and Srotests
accomSanied obedience to  Paul’s  command. The  Guildsmen  remained
standinJ near the  communications eTuiSment. They  Irowned  at  Paul in
obvious indecision.
   They’re accustomed to seeing the future, Paul thought. In this place and
time they’re blind … even as I am. And he samSled the time- winds, sensinJ
the turmoil, the storm ne[us  that now Iocused on this moment Slace. Even
the Iaint JaSs were closed now. Here was the unborn Mihad, he knew. Here
was the race consciousness that he had known  once as his  own  terrible
SurSose. Here was reason enouJh Ior a Kwisatz Haderach or a  Lisan al-
Gaib or even the haltinJ schemes oI the Bene Gesserit. The race oI humans
had Ielt its own dormancy, sensed itselI Jrown stale and knew now only the
need to e[Serience turmoil in which the Jenes would minJle and the stronJ
new mi[tures   survive. All   humans were  alive  as an unconscious sinJle
orJanism in  this  moment, e[SeriencinJ  a kind  oI  se[ual  heat that  could
override any barrier.
   And  Paul saw how Iutile  were any eIIorts oI  his to chanJe any smallest
bit oI this. He had thouJht to oSSose the Mihad within himselI, but the Mihad
would be. His leJions would raJe out Irom Arrakis even without him.  They
needed only the leJend he  already had become. He had shown them  the
way, Jiven them mastery even over the Guild which must have the sSice to
e[ist.
   A  sense oI Iailure Servaded him, and he saw throuJh it that Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen had sliSSed out oI the torn uniIorm, striSSed down to a IiJhtinJ
Jirdle with a mail core.
   This  is the  climax, Paul  thought.  From here, the  future will   open, the
clouds part onto a  kind of glory.  And if  I die here, they’ll  say I  sacrificed
myself that my spirit might lead them. And if I  live, they’ll  say nothing can
oppose Muad’Dib.
   “Is   the Atreides  ready?”  Feyd-Rautha called,  usinJ the  words  oI  the
ancient kanly ritual.
   Paul chose to answer him in  the Fremen way: “May  thy  kniIe chiS and
shatter!” He  Sointed to the  EmSeror’s blade on the  Iloor,  indicatinJ  that
Feyd-Rautha should advance and take it.

537
   KeeSinJ   his  attention  on   Paul,  Feyd-Rautha  Sicked  uS  the  kniIe,
balancinJ it a moment in his hand to Jet the Ieel oI it. E[citement kindled in
him.  This  was a  IiJht   he had  dreamed about—man  aJainst man,  skill
aJainst skill  with  no  shields interveninJ.  He  could  see a way  to  Sower
oSeninJ beIore him  because the EmSeror surely  would  reward whoever
killed  this  troublesome  duke. The  reward  miJht   even be  that  hauJhty
dauJhter and a share oI the throne. And  this yokel  duke, this back-world
adventurer could not Sossibly be a match Ior a Harkonnen trained in every
device and every treachery by a thousand arena combats. And the yokel had
no way oI knowinJ he Iaced more weaSons than a kniIe here.
   Let  us  see if  you’re   proof  against poison!  Feyd-Rautha  thouJht.  He
saluted Paul with the EmSeror’s blade, said: “Meet your death, Iool.”
   “Shall  we IiJht, cousin?” Paul asked. And he cat-Iooted Iorward, eyes on
the waitinJ blade, his body crouched low with his own milk-white cryskniIe
SointinJ out as thouJh an e[tension oI his arm.
   They circled each other, bare Ieet JratinJ on the Iloor, watchinJ with eyes
intent Ior the sliJhtest oSeninJ.
   “How  beautiIully  you dance,” Feyd-Rautha said.
   He’s a  talker, Paul thouJht. There’s another weakness. He grows uneasy
in the face of silence.
   “Have  you been shriven?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
   Still,  Paul circled in silence.
   And  the old  Reverend Mother, watchinJ the IiJht  Irom  the Sress oI the
EmSeror’s suite, Ielt herselI tremblinJ.  The Atreides  youth had called the
Harkonnen cousin. It could  only  mean he knew the ancestry they shared,
easy to understand because he was the Kwisatz Haderach. But the words
Iorced her to Iocus on the only thinJ that mattered to her here.
   This could be a maMor catastroShe Ior the Bene Gesserit breedinJ scheme.
   She had seen somethinJ oI  what Paul had seen here, that Feyd-Rautha
miJht   kill    but   not  be   victorious.   Another   thouJht,   thouJh,   almost
overwhelmed her. Two end Sroducts oI this lonJ and costly SroJram Iaced
each other in a IiJht  to the  death that miJht easily  claim both oI  them. II
both died here that would leave only Feyd-Rautha’s bastard dauJhter, still a
baby, an unknown, an unmeasured Iactor, and Alia, the abomination.
   “PerhaSs you have only SaJan rites here,” Feyd-Rautha said. “Would you
like the EmSeror’s Truthsayer to SreSare your sSirit Ior its Mourney?”

538
   Paul smiled, circlinJ  to the riJht,  alert, his black thouJhts suSSressed by
the needs oI the moment.
   Feyd-Rautha leaSed, IeintinJ with  riJht hand, but  with the kniIe  shiIted
in a blur to his leIt hand.
   Paul  dodJed easily,  notinJ  the  shield-conditioned hesitation  in  Feyd-
Rautha’s thrust. Still, it was not as Jreat a shield conditioninJ as some Paul
had seen,  and he  sensed that  Feyd-Rautha  had  IouJht  beIore  aJainst
unshielded Ioes.
   “Does an Atreides run or stand and IiJht?” Feyd-Rautha asked.
   Paul  resumed his silent circlinJ.   Idaho’s words came back to  him,  the
words oI  traininJ  Irom  the lonJ-aJo  Sractice Iloor on  Caladan: “Use the
first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for Tuick victory
this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time
and be sure. ”
   “PerhaSs you think this dance SrolonJs your liIe a Iew moments,” Feyd-
Rautha said. “Well and Jood.” He stoSSed the circlinJ, straiJhtened.
   Paul had seen enouJh Ior a Iirst  aSSro[imation. Feyd-Rautha led to the
leIt side, SresentinJ the riJht hiS as thouJh the mailed IiJhtinJ Jirdle could
Srotect his entire side. It was the action oI a man trained to the shield  and
with a kniIe in both hands.
   Or  …  And Paul  hesitated…. the Jirdle  was more  than it  seemed. The
Harkonnen aSSeared too conIident aJainst a man who’d  this day  led the
Iorces oI victory aJainst Sardaukar leJions.
   Feyd-Rautha noted  the hesitation,  said: “Why   SrolonJ the  inevitable?
You but keeS me Irom e[ercisinJ my riJhts over this ball oI dirt.”
   II  it’s  a flip-dart,  Paul thouJht, it’s  a cunning one. The girdle  shows no
signs of tampering.
   “Why  don’t you sSeak?” Feyd-Rautha demanded.
   Paul resumed his SrobinJ circle, allowinJ himselI a cold smile at the tone
oI unease in Feyd-Rautha’s voice, evidence that the Sressure oI silence was
buildinJ.
   “You  smile, eh?” Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaSed in mid-sentence.
   E[SectinJ  the sliJht hesitation, Paul almost Iailed to evade the downIlash
oI blade, Ielt its tiS scratch his leIt  arm. He silenced the sudden Sain there,
his mind Ilooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick
—an overIeint. Here was more oI an oSSonent than he had e[Sected. There
would be tricks within tricks within  tricks.

539
   “Your  own  ThuIir  Hawat  tauJht me  some oI  my  skills,”  Feyd-Rautha
said. “He Jave me Iirst blood. Too bad the old Iool didn’t live to see it.”
   And  Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, “Expect only what happens
in the fight. That way you’ll never be surprised. ”
   AJain  the two circled each other, crouched, cautious.
   Paul  saw the return  oI  elation to  his  oSSonent, wondered at it. Did  a
scratch siJniIy  that  much to  the man? Unless  there were Soison on  the
blade! But  how  could there be? His  own  men had handled  the weaSon,
snooSed it beIore SassinJ it. They were too well trained to miss an obvious
thinJ like that.
   “That  woman you  were talkinJ  to over  there,” Feyd-Rautha said. “The
little one. Is she somethinJ sSecial to you? A Set SerhaSs? Will she deserve
my sSecial attentions?”
   Paul remained silent, SrobinJ with his inner senses, e[amininJ the blood
Irom the wound, IindinJ  a trace oI soSoriIic Irom  the EmSeror’s blade. He
realiJned his own metabolism to match this threat and chanJe the molecules
oI the  soSoriIic, but  he Ielt  a thrill  oI  doubt. They’d  been SreSared with
soSoriIic on a  blade. A  soSoriIic. NothinJ  to  alert a  Soison snooSer, but
stronJ enouJh to slow the  muscles it touched. His enemies had their own
Slans within Slans, their own stacked treacheries.
   AJain  Feyd-Rautha leaSed, stabbinJ.
   Paul,  the  smile  Irozen on  his  Iace,  Ieinted  with  slowness as  thouJh
inhibited  by the  druJ  and at  the last  instant dodJed to  meet  the down-
IlashinJ arm on the cryskniIe’s Soint.
   Feyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shiIted to
his leIt  hand, and the measure oI  him that  only  a sliJht  Saleness oI Maw
betrayed the acid Sain where Paul had cut him.
   Let  him know his  own moment of doubt, Paul thouJht.  Let him  suspect
poison.
   “Treachery!”  Feyd-Rautha shouted. “He’s Soisoned me! I do Ieel Soison
in my arm!”
   Paul droSSed his cloak oI silence, said: “Only a little  acid to counter the
soSoriIic on the EmSeror’s blade.”
   Feyd-Rautha matched Paul’s cold  smile, liIted  blade in  leIt  hand Ior  a
mock salute. His eyes Jlared raJe behind the kniIe.
   Paul shiIted his cryskniIe to his leIt  hand, matchinJ his oSSonent. AJain,
they circled, SrobinJ.

540
   Feyd-Rautha beJan closinJ the sSace between them, edJinJ in, kniIe held
hiJh, anJer showinJ itselI  in sTuint oI  eye and set oI Maw. He Ieinted riJht
and under, and they were Sressed aJainst each other, kniIe hands JriSSed,
straininJ.
   Paul, cautious oI  Feyd-Rautha’s riJht  hiS where he susSected a Soison
IliS-dart, Iorced  the turn  to the  riJht.  He almost  Iailed to  see the needle
Soint Ilick  out beneath the belt line. A shiIt  and a JivinJ  in Feyd-Rautha’s
motion  warned him.   The  tiny  Soint  missed Paul’s  Ilesh  by  the  barest
Iraction.
   On the left hip!
   Treachery  within  treachery  within   treachery, Paul  reminded  himselI.
UsinJ Bene Gesserit-trained muscles, he saJJed to catch a reIle[ in Feyd-
Rautha, but  the  necessity oI   avoidinJ  the  tiny   Soint  MuttinJ Irom  his
oSSonent’s hiS threw Paul oII Must enouJh that he missed his IootinJ and
Iound himselI thrown hard to the Iloor, Feyd-Rautha on toS.
   “You   see it  there on  my  hiS?”  Feyd-Rautha whisSered. “Your  death,
Iool.”  And he beJan twistinJ  himselI  around, IorcinJ the Soisoned needle
closer and closer. “It’ll   stoS your  muscles and my  kniIe  will  Iinish  you.
There’ll be never a trace leIt to detect!”
   Paul  strained, hearinJ the silent  screams in his  mind, his  cell-stamSed
ancestors demandinJ that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha, to
save himselI.
   “I  will  not say it!”  Paul JasSed.
   Feyd-Rautha JaSed at him, cauJht in the merest Iraction oI hesitation. It
was enouJh  Ior   Paul to   Iind  the  weakness oI   balance in   one oI   his
oSSonent’s leJ muscles, and their Sositions were reversed. Feyd-Rautha lay
Sartly underneath with riJht   hiS hiJh,  unable to turn  because oI the tiny
needle Soint cauJht aJainst the Iloor beneath him.
   Paul twisted his leIt  hand Iree, aided by the lubrication oI blood Irom his
arm, thrust  once hard  uS underneath Feyd-Rautha’s Maw. The Soint slid
home into the brain. Feyd-Rautha Merked and saJJed back, still held Sartly
on his side by the needle imbedded in the Iloor.
   BreathinJ  deeSly to restore his calm, Paul Sushed himselI away and Jot
to his  Ieet. He  stood over  the body, kniIe  in  hand, raised his  eyes with
deliberate slowness to look across the room at the EmSeror.
   “MaMesty,” Paul said, “your Iorce is reduced by one more. Shall we now
shed sham  and Sretense? Shall  we  now  discuss what   must be?  Your

541
dauJhter wed to  me  and the  way  oSened Ior an  Atreides  to sit  on  the
throne.”
   The EmSeror turned, looked at Count FenrinJ. The Count met his stare—
Jray eyes aJainst Jreen. The thouJht lay there clearly between them, their
association so lonJ that understandinJ could be achieved with a Jlance.
   Kill   this upstart for  me, the EmSeror was sayinJ. The Atreides is young
and resourceful, yes—but he is also tired from  long effort  and he’d be no
match for you, anyway. Call  him out  now … you know the  way of it.  Kill
him.
   Slowly,  FenrinJ moved his head, a SrolonJed turninJ until he Iaced Paul.
   “Do  it!”  the EmSeror hissed.
   The  Count  Iocused on  Paul,  seeinJ with   eyes his  Lady  MarJot  had
trained in the Bene Gesserit way, aware oI the mystery and hidden Jrandeur
about this Atreides youth.
   I  could kill him, FenrinJ thouJht—and he knew this Ior a truth.
   SomethinJ  in  his own  secretive deSths stayed the Count then, and  he
JlimSsed brieIly, inadeTuately, the advantaJe he held over Paul—a way oI
hidinJ  Irom  the youth,  a Iurtiveness  oI  Serson and motives that  no eye
could Senetrate.
   Paul,  aware  oI  some  oI  this   Irom  the  way  the  time  ne[us   boiled,
understood at  last why   he had  never  seen FenrinJ  alonJ  the webs  oI
Srescience. FenrinJ was one oI the miJht-have-beens, an almost-Kwisatz
Haderach, criSSled by a Ilaw  in the  Jenetic Sattern—a eunuch, his talent
concentrated into Iurtiveness and inner seclusion. A  deeS comSassion Ior
the Count Ilowed  throuJh  Paul, the  Iirst  sense oI brotherhood he’d  ever
e[Serienced.
   FenrinJ, readinJ Paul’s emotion, said, “MaMesty, I must reIuse.”
   RaJe  overcame  Shaddam IV.  He  took   two  short  steSs throuJh  the
entouraJe, cuIIed FenrinJ viciously across the Maw.
   A  dark Ilush sSread uS and over the Count’s Iace. He looked directly at
the EmSeror,  sSoke with  deliberate  lack  oI  emShasis: “We  have  been
Iriends, MaMesty. What I do now is out oI IriendshiS. I shall IorJet that you
struck me.”
   Paul cleared his throat, said: “We were sSeakinJ oI the throne, MaMesty.”
   The EmSeror whirled, Jlared at Paul. “I sit on the throne!” he barked.
   “You  shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus,” Paul said.

542
   “I  Sut down my arms and came here on your word oI bond!” the EmSeror
shouted. “You dare threaten—”
   “Your  Serson is saIe in my Sresence,” Paul said. “An Atreides Sromised
it. Muad’Dib,   however, sentences you to your Srison Slanet. But have no
Iear, MaMesty. I will ease the harshness oI the Slace with all the Sowers at
my disSosal. It shall become a Jarden world, Iull oI Jentle thinJs.”
   As  the hidden imSort  oI Paul’s words  Jrew in  the EmSeror’s mind,  he
Jlared across the room at Paul. “Now we see true motives,” he sneered.
   “Indeed,”  Paul said.
   “And  what  oI Arrakis?”  the EmSeror asked. “Another Jarden world Iull
oI Jentle thinJs?”
   “The  Fremen have the  word  oI Muad‘Dib,”   Paul  said. “There  will  be
IlowinJ  water here oSen to the sky and Jreen oases rich with Jood thinJs.
But we have the sSice to think oI, too. Thus, there will always be desert on
Arrakis … and Iierce winds, and trials to touJhen a man. We Fremen have a
sayinJ: ‘God  created Arrakis to  train the IaithIul.’   One cannot Jo aJainst
the word oI God.”
   The old  Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, had her
own view  oI  the hidden meaninJ in  Paul’s words now. She JlimSsed the
Mihad and said: “You cannot loose these SeoSle uSon the universe!”
   “You  will  think back to the Jentle ways oI the Sardaukar!” Paul snaSSed.
   “You  cannot,” she whisSered.
   “You’re  a  Truthsayer,” Paul said. “Review  your  words.” He  Jlanced at
the Princess Royal, back to the EmSeror. “Best be done Tuickly, MaMesty.”
   The EmSeror turned a stricken look  uSon his dauJhter. She touched his
arm, sSoke soothinJly: “For this I was trained, Father.”
   He took a deeS breath.
   “You  cannot stay this thinJ,” the old Truthsayer muttered.
   The  EmSeror straiJhtened, standinJ stiIIly  with  a  look  oI remembered
diJnity. “Who will  neJotiate Ior you, kinsman?” he asked.
   Paul turned, saw his mother, her eyes heavy-lidded, standinJ with Chani
in a sTuad oI Fedaykin Juards. He crossed to them, stood lookinJ down at
Chani.
   “I  know the reasons,” Chani whisSered. “II it must be… Usul.”
   Paul, hearinJ the secret tears in her voice, touched her cheek. “My Sihaya
need Iear nothinJ,  ever,”  he  whisSered. He droSSed his  arm, Iaced  his
mother. “You will  neJotiate Ior  me, Mother, with  Chani by your side. She

543
has wisdom and  sharS eyes. And it  is  wisely  said  that no  one barJains
touJher than a Fremen. She will be lookinJ throuJh the eyes oI her love Ior
me and with the thouJht  oI her sons to be, what  they will  need. Listen to
her.”
   Jessica sensed the harsh calculation  in  her  son, Sut down  a  shudder.
“What are your instructions?” she asked.
   “The  EmSeror’s entire CHOAM ComSany holdinJs as dowry,” he said.
   “Entire?”  She was shocked almost sSeechless.
   “He  is to be striSSed. I’ll want an earldom and CHOAM  directorshiS Ior
Gurney Halleck,  and him in  the IieI  oI  Caladan. There will   be titles and
attendant Sower  Ior  every  survivinJ   Atreides   man, not   e[ceStinJ  the
lowliest trooSer.”
   “What  oI the Fremen?” Jessica asked.
   “The  Fremen are mine,” Paul said. “What they receive shall be disSensed
by Muad’Dib.  It’ll  beJin  with StilJar  as Governor on Arrakis, but that can
wait.”
   “And  Ior me?” Jessica asked.
   “Is  there somethinJ you wish?”
   “PerhaSs Caladan,” she said, lookinJ  at  Gurney. “I’m   not certain. I’ve
become too much the Fremen … and the Reverend Mother. I need a time oI
Seace and stillness in which to think.”
   “That  you shall have,” Paul said, “and anythinJ else that Gurney or I can
Jive you.”
   Jessica nodded, IeelinJ  suddenly  old and  tired.  She looked  at Chani.
“And Ior the royal concubine?”
   “No  title Ior  me,” Chani whisSered. “NothinJ. I beJ oI you.”
   Paul  stared down into  her eyes, rememberinJ her suddenly as she had
stood once  with  little   Leto  in   her arms,  their  child   now  dead in  this
violence. “I  swear to  you now,”  he whisSered, “that  you’ll  need no title.
That woman over there will  be my wiIe  and you but  a concubine because
this is a Solitical thinJ  and we must weld Seace out oI this moment, enlist
the Great Houses  oI  the Landsraad. We  must obey  the Iorms.  Yet  that
Srincess shall have no more oI  me than my  name. No child  oI  mine nor
touch nor soItness oI Jlance, nor instant oI desire.”
   “So  you say now,”  Chani said. She Jlanced across the room at  the tall
Srincess.

544
   “Do  you know so little  oI my son?” Jessica whisSered. “See that Srincess
standinJ there, so hauJhty and conIident. They say she has Sretensions oI a
literary nature. Let us hoSe she Iinds solace in such thinJs; she’ll have little
else.” A bitter lauJh escaSed Jessica. “Think on it, Chani: that Srincess will
have the name, yet she’ll live  as less than a concubine—never to know  a
moment oI  tenderness Irom  the man  to  whom  she’s bound. While   we,
Chani, we who carry the name oI concubine—history will call us wives.”

                              Appendix     I:  The   Ecology    of  Dune


        Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase. This is
        as true of humans in the finite space of a planetary ecosystem as it is of gas molecules in a
        sealed flask. The human Tuestion is not how many can possibly survive within the system, but
        what kind of existence is possible for those who do survive.
                                                                   —Pardot Kynes, First PlanetoloJist of Arrakis


 
  THE EFFECT oI  Arrakis   on  the mind   oI  the newcomer  usually   is that  oI
overSowerinJ  barren  land.  The  stranJer  miJht  think   nothinJ  could  live   or
Jrow  in the  oSen here, that this  was the  true wasteland  that had never  been
Iertile  and never would  be.
    To  Pardot  Kynes,   the  Slanet  was   merely  an  e[Sression   oI   enerJy,  a
machine beinJ  driven   by its  sun.  What  it needed  was reshaSinJ  to Iit   it to
man’s needs. His  mind  went directly   to the  Iree-movinJ   human SoSulation,
the Fremen.   What  a  challenJe!   What   a tool   they  could   be!  Fremen:  an
ecoloJical  and JeoloJical  Iorce  oI almost  unlimited  Sotential.
    A  direct  and simSle  man in  many  ways,  Pardot Kynes.  One  must evade
Harkonnen  restrictions?   E[cellent.    Then   one  marries  a  Fremen  woman.
When she  Jives  you  a Fremen  son, you  beJin  with  him,   with  Liet-Kynes,
and the  other  children,   teachinJ  them  ecoloJical    literacy,  creatinJ   a new
lanJuaJe with  symbols  that arm the  mind to  maniSulate an entire  landscaSe,
its climate,   seasonal limits,   and Iinally   to  break  throuJh  all  ideas  oI  Iorce
into the dazzlinJ  awareness oI  order.
    “There’s  an  internally   recoJnized  beauty  oI  motion  and  balance on  any
man-healthy   Slanet,”   Kynes   said.   “You   see  in   this   beauty  a   dynamic
stabilizinJ   eIIect   essential  to  all  liIe.   Its  aim  is   simSle:  to  maintain   and
Sroduce coordinated  Satterns oI Jreater  and Jreater diversity.  LiIe   imSroves
the closed system’s  caSacity to  sustain liIe.  LiIe—all    liIe—is   in the  service
oI liIe.   Necessary nutrients  are made available  to  liIe  by  liIe  in  Jreater and
Jreater  richness  as  the  diversity    oI  liIe   increases.  The  entire   landscaSe
comes    alive,     Iilled      with      relationshiSs     and    relationshiSs      within
relationshiSs.”

547
   This was Pardot Kynes lecturinJ to a sietch warren class.
   BeIore   the  lectures,  thouJh,   he  had  to   convince  the   Fremen.  To
understand how this came about, you must Iirst  understand the enormous
sinJle-mindedness, the innocence with which he aSSroached any Sroblem.
He was not naive, he merely Sermitted himselI no distractions.
   He was e[SlorinJ  the Arrakis landscaSe in a one-man Jroundcar one hot
aIternoon  when  he  stumbled  onto   a  deSlorably  common   scene. Si[
Harkonnen bravos, shielded and  Iully  armed,  had traSSed three Fremen
youths in the oSen behind the Shield Wall near the villaJe oI Windsack. To
Kynes, it was a dinJ-donJ battle, more slaSstick then real, until he Iocused
on the Iact that the Harkonnens intended to kill  the Fremen. By  this time,
one oI the youths was down with  a severed artery, two oI the bravos were
down as well, but it was still Iour armed men aJainst two striSlinJs.
   Kynes  wasn’t brave; he merely had that sinJle-mindedness and caution.
The Harkonnens were killinJ Fremen. They were destroyinJ the tools with
which he intended to remake a Slanet! He triJJered his own shield, waded
in and had two  oI  the Harkonnens dead with a  sliS-tiS beIore they knew
anyone was behind them. He dodJed a sword thrust Irom one oI the others,
slit the man’s throat with a neat entrisseur, and leIt the lone remaininJ bravo
to the two Fremen youths, turninJ his Iull attention to savinJ the lad on the
Jround. And  save the lad he did…  while  the si[th  Harkonnen was  beinJ
disSatched.
   Now  here was a Sretty kettle oI sandtrout! The Fremen didn’t know what
to make oI Kynes. They  knew who he was, oI course. No man arrived  on
Arrakis without  a Iull  dossier IindinJ its  way into the Fremen stronJholds.
They knew him: he was an ImSerial servant.
   But he killed  Harkonnens!
   Adults  miJht have shruJJed and, with some reJret, sent his shade to Moin
those oI   the  si[    dead men   on  the  Jround.  But   these  Fremen  were
ine[Serienced youths  and  all  they  could  see  was  that they  owed  this
ImSerial servant a mortal obliJation.
   Kynes  wound uS two  days later in  a sietch that looked down  on Wind
Pass. To him, it was all very natural. He talked to the Fremen about water,
about dunes anchored by  Jrass, about Salmaries Iilled   with  date Salms,
about oSen Tanats IlowinJ   across the desert. He  talked  and talked  and
talked.

548
   All   around him raJed a  debate that Kynes never saw. What to do  with
this madman? He knew the location oI a maMor sietch. What to do? What oI
his words, this mad talk  about a Saradise on Arrakis? Just talk. He knows
too much. But he killed Harkonnens! What oI the water burden? When did
we owe the  ImSerium anythinJ?  He killed  Harkonnens. Anyone  can kill
Harkonnens. I have done it myselI.
   But what oI  this talk about the IlowerinJ oI Arrakis?
   Very simSle: Where is the water Ior this?
   He says it is here! And he did save three oI ours.
   He   saved three  Iools   who  had  Sut  themselves in   the  way  oI   the
Harkonnen Iist! And he has seen crysknives!
   The  necessary decision was known Ior hours beIore it was voiced.  The
tau oI a sietch tells  its members what they must  do; even the most brutal
necessity is known.  An  e[Serienced IiJhter  was sent with   a consecrated
kniIe to do the Mob. Two watermen Iollowed him to Jet the water Irom the
body. Brutal necessity.
   It’s  doubtIul  that Kynes even Iocused on  his would-be e[ecutioner.  He
was talkinJ  to a JrouS that  sSread around him at a cautious distance. He
walked as he talked: a short circle, JesturinJ. OSen water, Kynes said. Walk
in the oSen without stillsuits. Water Ior diSSinJ it out oI a Sond! PortyJuls!
   The kniIeman conIronted him.
   “Remove   yourselI,”   Kynes  said,  and  went  on   talkinJ  about  secret
windtraSs. He  brushed Sast the  man.  Kynes’  back  stood oSen  Ior  the
ceremonial blow.
   What  went  on in  that  would-be  e[ecutioner’s  mind  cannot be known
now. Did he Iinally  listen to Kynes and believe? Who knows? But what he
did is a matter oI record. Uliet was his name, Older Liet. Uliet walked three
Saces and deliberately Iell   on his  own  kniIe,  thus  “removinJ”   himselI.
Suicide? Some say Shai-hulud moved him.
   Talk about omens!
   From  that  instant, Kynes  had but  to  Soint, sayinJ  “Go  there.”  Entire
Fremen tribes went. Men died, women died, children died. But they went.
   Kynes  returned to his  ImSerial chores, directinJ  the BioloJical  TestinJ
Stations. And now, Fremen beJan to aSSear amonJ the Station Sersonnel.
The Fremen looked at  each other. They were inIiltratinJ   the “system,”  a
Sossibility they’d  never considered. Station tools beJan IindinJ  their  way

549
into  the  sietch  warrens—esSecially cutterays  which  were  used  to  diJ
underJround catchbasins and hidden windtraSs.
   Water beJan collectinJ in the basins.
   It  became aSSarent to the Fremen that Kynes was not a madman totally,
Must mad enouJh to be holy. He was one oI the umma, the brotherhood oI
SroShets. The shade oI Uliet   was advanced to  the sadus, the thronJ  oI
heavenly MudJes.
   Kynes—direct,   savaJely  intent  Kynes—knew   that  hiJhly    orJanized
research is  Juaranteed to  Sroduce  nothinJ  new.  He  set  uS  small-unit
e[Seriments with reJular interchanJe oI  data Ior a swiIt  Tansley eIIect, let
each JrouS Iind its own Sath. They must accumulate millions oI tiny  Iacts.
He  orJanized  only  isolated  and  rouJh   run-throuJh  tests  to  Sut  their
diIIiculties into SersSective.
   Core samSlinJs were made throuJhout the bled. Charts were develoSed
on the lonJ  driIts oI  weather that are called climate. He  Iound that in  the
wide belt contained by  the 70-deJree lines, north and south, temSeratures
Ior thousands oI years hadn’t Jone outside the 254-332 deJrees (absolute)
ranJe, and that  this  belt  had lonJ  JrowinJ   seasons where temSeratures
ranJed Irom 284 to 302 deJrees absolute: the “bonanza” ranJe Ior terraIorm
liIe … once they solved the water Sroblem.
   When will  we solve it? the Fremen asked. When will we see Arrakis as a
Saradise?
   In  the manner oI a teacher answerinJ a child who has asked the sum oI 2
Slus 2, Kynes told them: “From three hundred to Iive hundred years.”
   A  lesser Iolk miJht  have howled in dismay. But the Fremen had learned
Satience Irom men with whiSs. It was a bit lonJer than they had anticiSated,
but they all could see that the blessed day was cominJ. They tiJhtened their
sashes and went back to  work.  Somehow, the  disaSSointment made the
SrosSect oI Saradise more real.
   The concern on Arrakis was not with water, but with moisture. Pets were
almost  unknown,  stock  animals   rare.  Some  smuJJlers  emSloyed  the
domesticated desert ass, the kulon, but the water Srice was hiJh even when
the beasts were Iitted with modiIied stillsuits.
   Kynes  thouJht oI  installinJ  reduction Slants to  recover water Irom  the
hydroJen and o[yJen locked in  native rock, but the enerJy-cost Iactor was
Iar too hiJh. The  Solar caSs (disreJardinJ the Ialse sense oI water security
they Jave the Syons) held Iar too small an amount Ior his SroMect … and he

550
already susSected where the water had to  be. There  was that  consistent
increase oI moisture at median altitudes, and in  certain winds. There was
that Srimary clue  in  the air  balance—23 Ser cent o[yJen,   75.4 Ser cent
nitroJen and .023 Ser cent carbon dio[ide—with  the trace Jases takinJ uS
the rest.
   There was a rare native root Slant that Jrew above the 2,500-meter level
in the northern temSerate zone. A tuber two meters lonJ yielded halI a liter
oI  water. And  there  were the  terraIorm  desert Slants: the  touJher ones
showed  siJns  oI   thrivinJ   iI    Slanted in   deSressions lined   with   dew
SreciSitators.
   Then Kynes saw the salt San.
   His  ’thoSter, IlyinJ  between stations Iar out on the bled,  was blown oII
course by a storm. When the storm Sassed, there was the San—a Jiant oval
deSression some three hundred kilometers on the lonJ a[is—a JlarinJ white
surSrise in the oSen desert. Kynes landed, tasted the San’s storm-cleaned
surIace.
   Salt.
   Now, he was certain.
   There’d  been oSen water on Arrakis—once. He beJan ree[amininJ  the
evidence oI   the  dry  wells  where  trickles   oI  water  had  aSSeared and
vanished, never to return.
   Kynes set his newly trained Fremen limnoloJist to work:  their chieI clue,
leathery scraSs oI matter sometimes Iound with the sSice-mass aIter a blow.
This had been ascribed to a Iictional “sandtrout” in Fremen Iolk stories. As
Iacts Jrew  into   evidence, a creature  emerJed to  e[Slain  these leathery
scraSs—a sandswimmer that blocked oII water into  Iertile  Sockets within
the Sorous lower strata below the 280° (absolute) line.
   This  “water-stealer”  died  by  the millions   in  each sSice-blow. A  Iive-
deJree chanJe in temSerature could  kill  it.  The  Iew  survivors entered a
semidormant cyst-hibernation to emerJe in si[  years as small (about three
meters lonJ) sandworms. OI these, only a Iew avoided their larJer brothers
and Sre-sSice water Sockets to emerJe into maturity as the Jiant shai-hulud.
(Water is  Soisonous to shai-hulud  as the Fremen had  lonJ  known  Irom
drowninJ  the  rare  “stunted  worm”   oI   the  Minor   ErJ  to   Sroduce the
awareness-sSectrum narcotic they call Water oI LiIe. The “stunted worm” is
a Srimitive  Iorm  oI  shai-hulud that  reaches a lenJth  oI  only  about nine
meters.)

551
   Now  they  had the circular  relationshiS: little  maker to  Sre-sSice mass;
little  maker to shai-hulud;  shai-hulud to scatter the sSice uSon which Ied
microscoSic creatures called sand Slankton; the  sand Slankton, Iood  Ior
shai-hulud, JrowinJ, burrowinJ, becominJ little makers.
   Kynes and his SeoSle turned their attention Irom these Jreat relationshiSs
and Iocused now  on  micro-ecoloJy. First,  the  climate:  the sand surIace
oIten reached temSeratures oI 344° to 350° (absolute). A Ioot below Jround
it miJht  be 55°  cooler; a Ioot  above Jround, 25°  cooler. Leaves or black
shade could Srovide another 18° oI  coolinJ.  Ne[t,   the nutrients: sand oI
Arrakis is mostly  a Sroduct oI worm diJestion; dust (the truly  omniSresent
Sroblem there) is Sroduced by the  constant surIace creeS, the “saltation”
movement oI  sand. Coarse Jrains  are Iound  on  the downwind  sides oI
dunes. The windward side is Sacked smooth and hard. Old dunes are yellow
(o[idized), younJ dunes are the color oI the Sarent rock—usually Jray.
   Downwind   sides oI  old dunes Srovided the  Iirst  Slantation areas. The
Fremen aimed Iirst Ior  a cycle oI  Soverty Jrass with  Seatlike hair cilia  to
intertwine, mat and Ii[  the dunes by deSrivinJ the wind  oI its biJ  weaSon:
movable Jrains.
   AdaStive  zones were  laid  out in  the  deeS south Iar  Irom  Harkonnen
watchers. The   mutated  Soverty  Jrasses were   Slanted Iirst   alonJ   the
downwind (sliSIace) oI  the chosen dunes that stood across the Sath oI the
SrevailinJ westerlies. With the downwind Iace anchored, the windward Iace
Jrew hiJher and hiJher  and the Jrass was moved to keeS Sace. Giant siIs
(lonJ  dunes with  sinuous crest) oI  more  than 1,500  meters heiJht were
Sroduced this way.
   When  barrier dunes reached suIIicient heiJht, the windward  Iaces were
Slanted with  touJher sword  Jrasses. Each structure on a  base about si[
times as thick as its heiJht was anchored—“Ii[ed.”
   Now,   they  came  in  with   deeSer SlantinJs—eShemerals (chenoSods,
SiJweeds, and amaranth to beJin),  then  scotch broom,  low  luSine, vine
eucalyStus (the  tySe  adaSted  Ior   Caladan’s northern   reaches), dwarI
tamarisk, shore Sine—then the true desert Jrowths: candelilla, saJuaro, and
bis-naJa, the barrel cactus. Where it  would  Jrow,  they introduced  camel
saJe, onion  Jrass, Jobi   Ieather  Jrass, wild   alIalIa,  burrow  bush,  sand
verbena, eveninJ Srimrose, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush.
   They  turned then to  the necessary animal liIe—burrowinJ   creatures to
oSen the soil  and aerate it:   kit  Io[,   kanJaroo mouse, desert hare,  sand

552
terraSin … and the  Sredators to keeS them in check: desert hawk,  dwarI
owl, eaJle and desert owl; and insects to Iill the niches these couldn’t reach:
scorSion, centiSede, traSdoor sSider, the bitinJ wasS and the wormIly  …
and the desert bat to keeS watch on these.
   Now  came the crucial test: date Salms, cotton, melons, coIIee, medicinals
—more than 200 selected Iood Slant tySes to test and adaSt.
   “The  thinJ  the ecoloJically  illiterate  don’t realize about an ecosystem,”
Kynes said, “is that it’s  a system. A system! A  system maintains a certain
Iluid stability  that can be destroyed by a missteS in Must one niche. A system
has order, a IlowinJ Irom Soint to Soint. II somethinJ dams that Ilow, order
collaSses. The untrained miJht   miss that  collaSse until  it  was  too  late.
That’s  why   the  hiJhest  Iunction   oI  ecoloJy   is  the   understandinJ oI
conseTuences.”
   Had they achieved a system?
   Kynes and his SeoSle watched and waited. The Fremen now knew what
he meant by an oSen-end Srediction to Iive hundred years.
   A  reSort came uS Irom the Salmaries:
   At  the desert edJe oI the SlantinJs, the sand Slankton is beinJ Soisoned
throuJh  interaction  with   the  new   Iorms  oI   liIe.   The  reason:  Srotein
incomSatibility. Poisonous water was IorminJ there which  the Arrakis  liIe
would not  touch. A  barren zone surrounded the SlantinJs and even shai-
hulud would not invade it.
   Kynes went  down to the Salmaries himselI—a twenty-thumSer triS (in a
SalanTuin like  a  wounded man  or  Reverend Mother  because he  never
became a sandrider). He tested the barren zone  (it  stank to heaven) and
came uS with a bonus, a JiIt Irom Arrakis.
   The addition  oI sulIur  and Ii[ed  nitroJen converted the barren zone to a
rich Slant bed Ior terraIorm liIe. The SlantinJs could be advanced at will!
   “Does this chanJe the timinJ?” the Fremen asked.
   Kynes went back to his Slanetary Iormulae. WindtraS IiJures were Iairly
secure by then. He was Jenerous with his allowances, knowinJ he couldn’t
draw neat  lines around  ecoloJical  Sroblems. A  certain amount  oI  Slant
cover had to  be  set aside to  hold  dunes in  Slace; a certain  amount Ior
IoodstuIIs (both human and animal); a certain amount to  lock moisture in
root systems and to Ieed water out into surroundinJ Sarched areas. They’d
maSSed the rovinJ cold sSots on the oSen bled by this time. These had to be
IiJured into  the Iormulae.  Even shai-hulud had  a Slace in the  charts. He

553
must never  be  destroyed, else  sSice wealth  would  end.  But  his  inner
diJestive “Iactory,”   with   its  enormous concentrations oI  aldehydes and
acids, was a Jiant source oI  o[yJen.  A  medium worm (about  200 meters
lonJ)  discharJed  into  the  atmosShere as  much  o[yJen   as  ten  sTuare
kilometers oI Jreen-JrowinJ Shotosynthesis surIace.
   He had the Guild to consider. The sSice bribe to the Guild Ior SreventinJ
weather satellites and other watchers in  the skies oI  Arrakis  already had
reached maMor SroSortions.
   Nor  could  the  Fremen be  iJnored.  EsSecially the Fremen,  with  their
windtraSs and irreJular  landholdinJs orJanized around  water suSSly; the
Fremen with their  new ecoloJical literacy  and their dream oI cyclinJ  vast
areas oI Arrakis throuJh a Srairie Shase into Iorest cover.
   From  the charts emerJed a IiJure. Kynes reSorted it. Three Ser cent. II
they could Jet three Ser cent oI the Jreen Slant element on Arrakis involved
in IorminJ carbon comSounds, they’d have their selI-sustaininJ cycle.
   “But  how lonJ?” the Fremen demanded.
   “Oh,  that: about three hundred and IiIty years.”
   So it  was true as this umma had said in  the beJinninJ: the thinJ  would
not come in the liIetime oI  any man now livinJ,  nor in the liIetime  oI their
Jrandchildren eiJht times removed, but it would come.
   The work continued: buildinJ,  SlantinJ, diJJinJ, traininJ the children.
   Then Kynes-the-Umma was killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.
   By   this  time  his  son,  Liet-Kynes,  was  nineteen, a  Iull   Fremen and
sandrider who had killed  more than a hundred Harkonnens. The ImSerial
aSSointment Ior which the elder Kynes already had aSSlied in the name oI
his son was delivered as a matter oI course. The riJid class structure oI the
IauIreluches had its well-ordered SurSose here. The son had been trained to
Iollow the Iather.
   The course had been set by this time, the EcoloJical-Fremen were aimed
alonJ their way. Liet-Kynes had only to watch and nudJe and sSy uSon the
Harkonnens … until the day his Slanet was aIIlicted by a Hero.

                           Appendix   II:   The  ReliJion   of  Dune

BEFORE THE  cominJ  oI  Muad’Dib,  the  Fremen oI Arrakis  Sracticed a
reliJion whose roots in the Maometh Saari are there Ior any scholar to see.
Many have traced the e[tensive borrowinJs Irom other reliJions. The most
common e[amSle is  the Hymn  to  Water, a direct  coSy Irom  the OranJe
Catholic LiturJical  Manual, callinJ Ior  rain clouds which Arrakis had never
seen. But there are more SroIound Soints oI accord between the Kitab al-
Ibar oI the Fremen and the teachinJs oI Bible, Ilm, and FiTh.
   Any  comSarison oI the reliJious belieIs dominant in the ImSerium uS to
the time oI Muad’Dib  must start with  the maMor Iorces which shaSed those
belieIs:
       1. The  Iollowers oI  the Fourteen SaJes, whose Book was the OranJe
           Catholic Bible,  and whose views are e[Sressed in the Commentaries
           and other  literature  Sroduced by  the Commission  oI  Ecumenical
           Translators. (C.E.T.);
       2. The Bene Gesserit, who Srivately denied they were a reliJious order,
           but  who oSerated behind an  almost imSenetrable screen oI ritual
           mysticism, and whose traininJ, whose symbolism, orJanization, and
           internal teachinJ methods were almost wholly reliJious;
       3.  The aJnostic rulinJ  class (includinJ  the Guild)  Ior  whom reliJion
           was a kind oI SuSSet show to amuse the SoSulace and keeS it docile,
           and who  believed  essentially that  all  Shenomena—even reliJious
           Shenomena—could be reduced to mechanical e[Slanations;
       4. The so-called Ancient TeachinJs—includinJ those Sreserved by the
           Zensunni  Wanderers Irom   the  Iirst,   second,  and  third   Islamic
           movements;  the   Navachristianity   oI   Chusuk,  the   Buddislamic
           Variants oI  the tySes dominant at  Lankiveil  and Sikun,  the Blend
           Books  oI  the Mahayana Lankavatara, the  Zen HekiJanshu  oI  III
           Delta Pavonis, the Tawrah and Talmudic Zabur survivinJ on Salusa
           Secundus, the Servasive Obeah Ritual, the Muadh  Quran with  its
           Sure Ilm   and  FiTh  Sreserved amonJ the  Sundi  rice  Iarmers  oI
           Caladan, the Hindu outcroSSinJs Iound all  throuJh the universe in
           little  Sockets oI insulated Syons, and Iinally, the Butlerian Jihad.

555
   There is  a IiIth  Iorce  which  shaSed reliJious belieI, but its  eIIect is  so
universal and SroIound that it deserves to stand alone.
   This  is,  oI  course, sSace travel—and in  any discussion oI  reliJion,   it
deserves to be written thus:

                                                  SPACE TRAVEL!

   Mankind’s   movement throuJh  deeS sSace Slaced a uniTue  stamS on
reliJion   durinJ  the  one  hundred  and  ten  centuries  that  Sreceded the
Butlerian Jihad. To beJin with, early sSace travel, althouJh widesSread, was
larJely unreJulated, slow, and uncertain, and, beIore the Guild  monoSoly,
was  accomSlished  by   a   hodJeSodJe  oI   methods.   The   Iirst   sSace
e[Seriences, Soorly communicated and subMect to e[treme distortion, were a
wild inducement to mystical sSeculation.
   Immediately, sSace Jave a diIIerent Ilavor and sense to ideas oI Creation.
That diIIerence is  seen even in the hiJhest  reliJious  achievements oI the
Seriod. All   throuJh  reliJion,  the  IeelinJ  oI  the  sacred was  touched by
anarchy Irom the outer dark.
   It  was  as thouJh JuSiter in  all  his descendant Iorms retreated into the
maternal darkness to be  suSerseded by a Iemale immanence Iilled   with
ambiJuity and with a Iace oI many terrors.
   The ancient Iormulae intertwined, tanJled toJether as they were Iitted to
the needs oI new  conTuests and new heraldic symbols. It  was a  time oI
struJJle between beast-demons on the one side  and the old  Srayers and
invocations on the other.
   There was never a clear decision.
   DurinJ  this Seriod, it was said that Genesis was reinterSreted, SermittinJ
God to say:
   “Increase and multiSly, and Iill  the universe, and subdue it, and rule over
all manner oI stranJe beasts and livinJ creatures in the inIinite airs, on the
inIinite earths and beneath them.”
   It  was a  time oI  sorceresses whose Sowers were real. The measure oI
them is seen in the Iact they never boasted how they JrasSed the Iirebrand.
   Then  came the Butlerian Jihad—two  Jenerations oI chaos. The Jod  oI
machine-loJic was overthrown amonJ the  masses and a new conceSt was
raised:
   “Man  may not be reSlaced.”

556
   Those  two   Jenerations  oI  violence   were  a  thalamic  Sause Ior   all
humankind. Men looked  at their  Jods and their rituals  and saw that both
were Iilled with that most terrible oI all eTuations: Iear over ambition.
   Hesitantly, the leaders oI reliJions whose Iollowers had sSilled the blood
oI billions  beJan meetinJ to e[chanJe views. It was a move encouraJed by
the SSacinJ Guild,  which  was beJinninJ  to  build  its  monoSoly over  all
interstellar  travel,  and   by  the  Bene  Gesserit  who   were  bandinJ  the
sorceresses.
   Out oI those Iirst ecumenical meetinJs came two maMor develoSments:
       1.   The  realization   that  all   reliJions   had   at  least  one   common
           commandment: “Thou shalt not disIiJure the soul.”
       2. The Commission oI Ecumenical Translators.
   C.E.T. convened on a neutral island oI Old Earth, sSawninJ Jround oI the
mother reliJions. They met “in the common belieI that there e[ists a Divine
Essence in the universe.” Every  Iaith with  more than  a million  Iollowers
was reSresented, and they reached a surSrisinJly immediate aJreement on
the statement oI their common Joal:
   “We  are here to remove a Srimary weaSon Irom the hands oI  disSutant
reliJions.  That  weaSon—the claim  to   Sossession oI the  one  and only
revelation.”
   Jubilation  at this “siJn  oI SroIound accord” Sroved Sremature. For more
than a standard year, that statement was the only announcement Irom C.E.T.
Men sSoke bitterly oI the delay. Troubadours comSosed witty, bitinJ sonJs
about the one hundred and twenty-one
   “Old  Cranks” as the C.E.T. deleJates came to be called. (The name arose
Irom  a  ribald  Moke which Slayed on  the  C.E.T.  initials  and  called  the
deleJates “Cranks—EIIinJ-Turners.”) One oI  the sonJs, “Brown  ReSose,”
has underJone Seriodic revival and is SoSular even today:

       “Consider leis. 
       Brown reSose—and  
       The traJedy              
       In all  oI those  
       Cranks! All  those Cranks!  
       So laze—so laze                
       ThrouJh all your days.  
                                            

557
       Time has toll’d Ior 
       M’Lord  Sandwich!” 

   Occasional rumors  leaked out oI  the  C.E.T. sessions. It was said  they
were comSarinJ te[ts and, irresSonsibly, the te[ts were named. Such rumors
inevitably  Srovoked anti-ecumenism  riots  and, oI   course, insSired  new
witticisms.
   Two years Sassed … three years.
   The Commissioners, nine oI their oriJinal  number havinJ died and been
reSlaced, Saused to observe Iormal  installation  oI  the reSlacements and
announced they were laborinJ to Sroduce one book, weedinJ  out “all  the
SatholoJical symStoms” oI the reliJious Sast.
   “We  are SroducinJ an instrument oI Love to be Slayed in all ways,” they
said.
   Many  consider it odd that this statement Srovoked the worst outbreaks oI
violence  aJainst  ecumenism. Twenty  deleJates  were  recalled  by  their
conJreJations. One committed suicide by stealinJ a sSace IriJate and divinJ
it into the sun.
   Historians estimate the riots took eiJhty  million  lives. That works out  to
about  si[   thousand  Ior   each  world   then   in   the  Landsraad  LeaJue.
ConsiderinJ the unrest oI the time, this  may not be an e[cessive estimate,
althouJh any Sretense to real  accuracy in  the IiJure  must be  Must that—
Sretense. Communication between worlds was at one oI its lowest ebbs.
   The  troubadours, Tuite  naturally, had  a  Iield  day. A   SoSular musical
comedy oI the Seriod had one oI the C.E.T. deleJates sittinJ on a white sand
beach beneath a Salm tree sinJinJ:

       “For  God, woman and the sSlendor oI love 
       We dally here sans Iears or cares.              
       Troubadour! Troubadour, sinJ another melody  
       For God, woman and the sSlendor oI love!” 

   Riots  and comedy are but symStoms oI the times, SroIoundly revealinJ.
They betray  the  SsycholoJical  tone, the  deeS uncertainties …   and the
strivinJ Ior somethinJ better, Slus the Iear that nothinJ would come oI it all.
   The maMor dams aJainst anarchy in these times were the embryo Guild,
the Bene Gesserit and the Landsraad, which continued its 2,000-year record

558
oI meetinJ in sSite oI the severest obstacles. The Guild’s Sart aSSears clear:
they Jave Iree transSort Ior  all Landsraad and C.E.T. business. The Bene
Gesserit role is  more  obscure. Certainly, this  is  the time  in  which  they
consolidated their hold uSon the sorceresses, e[Slored the subtle narcotics,
develoSed Srana-bindu traininJ and conceived the Missionaria Protectiva,
that black  arm  oI   suSerstition. But  it   is  also  the  Seriod that  saw  the
comSosinJ oI the Litany aJainst Fear and the assembly oI the Azhar Book,
that biblioJraShic marvel that Sreserves the Jreat secrets oI the most ancient
Iaiths.
   InJsley’s comment is SerhaSs the only one Sossible:
   “Those were times oI deeS Sarado[.”
   For  almost  seven  years, then,  C.E.T.  labored. And   as their   seventh
anniversary  aSSroached, they    SreSared the   human   universe   Ior   a
momentous announcement. On that seventh anniversary, they unveiled the
OranJe Catholic Bible.
   “Here  is a work with  diJnity  and meaninJ,” they said. “Here is a way to
make humanity aware oI itselI as a total creation oI God.”
   The  men oI  C.E.T. were likened  to archeoloJists oI  ideas, insSired by
God in the  Jrandeur oI rediscovery. It  was said they had brouJht  to liJht
“the vitality  oI Jreat ideals overlaid by  the deSosits oI centuries,” that they
had  “sharSened the  moral   imSeratives  that  come  out  oI   a   reliJious
conscience.”
   With   the O.C.  Bible,  C.E.T. Sresented the LiturJical   Manual  and the
Commentaries—in  many  resSects a  more  remarkable  work,  not   only
because oI its brevity (less than halI  the size oI  the O.C. Bible),  but  also
because oI its candor and blend oI selI-Sity and selI-riJhteousness.
   The beJinninJ is an obvious aSSeal to the aJnostic rulers.
   “Men,   IindinJ   no answers to  the  sunnan [the  ten  thousand reliJious
Tuestions Irom the Shari-ah] now aSSly their own reasoninJ. All men seek
to be enliJhtened. ReliJion  is but  the most ancient and honorable way  in
which men  have striven to  make sense out oI  God’s universe. Scientists
seek the lawIulness oI events. It is the task oI ReliJion to  Iit  man into this
lawIulness.”
   In  their conclusion, thouJh, the Commentaries set a harsh tone that very
likely Ioretold their Iate.
   “Much   that was called  reliJion  has carried  an unconscious attitude oI
hostility  toward liIe.  True reliJion   must teach that liIe  is  Iilled  with  Moys

559
SleasinJ to the eye oI God, that knowledJe without action is emSty. All men
must see that the teachinJ oI reliJion  by  rules and rote is  larJely a  hoa[.
The SroSer teachinJ is recoJnized with ease. You can know it without Iail
because it  awakens within   you  that  sensation which   tells  you  this   is
somethinJ you’ve always known.”
   There was an odd sense oI calm as the Sresses and shiJawire imSrinters
rolled and the O.C. Bible  sSread out throuJh the worlds. Some interSreted
this as a siJn Irom God, an omen oI unity.
   But  even the C.E.T. deleJates betrayed the Iiction  oI that  calm as they
returned to their resSective conJreJations. EiJhteen oI them were lynched
within two months. FiIty-three recanted within the year.
   The  O.C. Bible  was denounced as a work  Sroduced by “the  hubris oI
reason.” It was said that  its SaJes were Iilled  with  a seductive interest in
loJic.  Revisions that  catered to  SoSular biJotry  beJan aSSearinJ. These
revisions leaned on acceSted symbolisms (Cross, Crescent, Feather Rattle,
the Twelve  Saints, the  thin  Buddha,  and the  like)  and  it  soon  became
aSSarent that the ancient suSerstitions and belieIs had not been absorbed by
the new ecumenism.
   Halloway’s     label   Ior    C.E.T.’s    seven-year   eIIort—“GalactoShasic
Determinism”—was  snaSSed uS by  eaJer  billions  who   interSreted the
initials G.D. as “God-Damned.”
   C.E.T. Chairman Toure Bomoko,  a Ulema oI  the Zensunnis and one oI
the  Iourteen deleJates  who  never  recanted (“The   Fourteen  SaJes” oI
SoSular history), aSSeared to admit Iinally the C.E.T. had erred.
   “We  shouldn’t have tried to create new symbols,” he said. “We should’ve
realized we   weren’t  suSSosed to introduce  uncertainties  into  acceSted
belieI, that we weren’t suSSosed to stir uS curiosity about God. We are daily
conIronted by the terriIyinJ  instability  oI  all  thinJs human, yet we  Sermit
our reliJions   to  Jrow  more riJid   and  controlled, more  conIorminJ  and
oSSressive. What is this shadow across the hiJhway oI Divine Command?
It  is a  warninJ  that institutions  endure, that  symbols endure when  their
meaninJ is lost, that there is no summa oI all attainable knowledJe.”
   The  bitter  double edJe  in  this  “admission”  did  not  escaSe Bomoko’s
critics  and  he  was  Iorced  soon  aIterward  to   Ilee  into  e[ile,    his  liIe
deSendent uSon the Guild’s SledJe oI secrecv. He reSortedly died on TuSile,
honored and beloved, his last words: “ReliJion   must remain an outlet Ior

560
SeoSle who say to themselves, ‘I am not the kind oI Serson I want to be.’ It
must never sink into an assemblaJe oI the selI-satisIied.”
   It  is Sleasant to think that Bomoko understood the SroShecy in his words:
“Institutions  endure.”  Ninety   Jenerations later,  the O.C.  Bible   and the
Commentaries Sermeated the reliJious universe.
   When  Paul-Muad’Dib   stood  with  his  riJht   hand on  the  rock  shrine
enclosinJ his Iather’s skull (the riJht  hand oI the blessed, not the leIt hand
oI the damned) he Tuoted word Ior word Irom “Bomoko’s LeJacy”—
   “You  who have deIeated us say to yourselves that Babylon is Iallen and
its works have been overturned. I say to you still that man remains on trial,
each man in his own dock. Each man is a little war.”
   The Fremen said oI  Muad’Dib  that he was like Abu  Zide whose IriJate
deIied the Guild and rode one day there and back. There used in this way
translates directly Irom the Fremen mytholoJy as the land oI the ruh-sSirit,
the alam al-mithal where all limitations are removed.
   The Sarallel between this and the Kwisatz Haderach is readily seen. The
Kwisatz Haderach that the Sisterhood souJht throuJh its breedinJ SroJram
was interSreted as “The shorteninJ oI the way” or “The one who can be two
Slaces simultaneously.”
   But  both oI these interSretations can be shown to stem directly Irom the
Commentaries: “When   law  and  reliJious   duty  are  one,  your  selIdom
encloses the universe.”
   OI  himselI, Muad’Dib  said: “I  am a net in the sea oI time, Iree to sweeS
Iuture and Sast. I am a  movinJ membrane Irom  whom no Sossibility  can
escaSe.”
   These thouJhts are all one and the same and they harken to 22 Kalima in
the O.C. Bible where it says: “Whether a thouJht is sSoken or not it is a real
thinJ and has Sowers oI reality.”
   It  is when we Jet into  Muad’Dib’s  own commentaries in “The Pillars  oI
the Universe” as interSreted by his holy men, the Qizara TaIwid, that we see
his real debt to C.E.T. and Fremen-Zensunni.
   Muad’Dib:    “Law   and  duty  are  one;  so  be  it.  But   remember these
limitations—Thusare you never  fully  self-conscious. Thus do you  remain
immersed in   the  communal  tau.   Thus  are  you  always  less  than   an
individual. ”
   O.C. Bible:  Identical wordinJ. (61 Revelations.)

561
   Muad’Dib:   “Religion  often partakes of the myth of progress that shields
us from the terrors of an uncertain future. ”
   C.E.T.  Commentaries: Identical wordinJ.  (The  Azhar  Book  traces this
statement  to   the  Iirst    century   reliJious   writer,   Neshou;   throuJh   a
SaraShrase.)
   Muad’Dib:   “If   a child,  an untrained person, an ignorant  person, or an
insane person incites trouble, it is  the fault of  authority for  not predicting
and preventing that trouble. ”
   O.C.  Bible:  “Any  sin can be  ascribed, at least in Sart, to a  natural bad
tendency that is  an  e[tenuatinJ  circumstance acceStable to  God.”  (The
Azhar Book traces this to the ancient Semitic Tawra.)
   Muad’Dib:   “Reach forth  thy hand and eat what God has provided thee;
and when thou are replenished, praise the Lord. ”
   O.C. Bible:  a SaraShrase with identical meaninJ. (The Azhar Book traces
this in sliJhtly diIIerent Iorm  to First Islam.)
   Muad’Dib:  “Kindness  is the beginning of cruelty. ”
   Fremen Kitab al-Ibar: “The  weiJht oI a kindly  God is a IearIul thinJ. Did
not God Jive us the burninJ sun (Al-Lat)? Did not God Jive us the Mothers
oI  Moisture  (Reverend Mothers)?  Did  not  God  Jive  us  Shaitan  (Iblis,
Satan)? From Shaitan did we not Jet the hurtIulness oI sSeed?”
   (This  is the source oI the Fremen sayinJ: “SSeed comes Irom Shaitan.”
Consider: Ior  every  one hundred calories  oI  heat Jenerated by  e[ercise
[sSeed] the body evaSorates about si[ ounces oI SersSiration. The Fremen
word Ior SersSiration is bakka or tears and, in one Sronunciation, translates:
“The liIe essence that Shaitan sTueezes Irom your soul.”)
 
   Muad’Dib’s   arrival   is  called  “reliJiously   timely”   by  Koneywell,   but
timinJ had little to do with it.  As Muad’Dib  himselI said: “I am here; so….”
   It  is, however, vital  to an understandinJ oI Muad’Dib’s  reliJious  imSact
that you  never lose siJht  oI  one  Iact: the  Fremen were  a desert SeoSle
whose entire ancestry was  accustomed to hostile  landscaSes. Mysticism
isn’t diIIicult  when you survive each second by surmountinJ oSen hostility.
“You are there—so ….”
   With   such a  tradition,  suIIerinJ  is  acceSted—SerhaSs as unconscious
Sunishment, but acceSted. And it’s  well  to note that  Fremen ritual  Jives
almost comSlete Ireedom Irom Juilt IeelinJs. This isn’t necessarily because
their law and reliJion  were identical, makinJ disobedience a sin. It’s likely

562
closer to the mark to say they  cleansed themselves oI Juilt easily because
their everyday e[istence reTuired brutal MudJments (oIten deadly) which in
a soIter land would burden men with unbearable Juilt.
   This   is  likely  one  oI  the  roots  oI  Fremen  emShasis on suSerstition
(disreJardinJ the Missionaria Protectiva’s ministrations).  What matter that
whistlinJ  sands are an omen? What matter that you must make the siJn oI
the Iist when  Iirst you  see First Moon? A  man’s Ilesh is  his own  and his
water belonJs to the tribe—and the mystery oI liIe isn’t  a Sroblem to solve
but a reality  to e[Serience. Omens helS you remember this. And  because
you are here, because you have the reliJion, victory cannot evade you in the
end.
   As  the Bene Gesserit tauJht Ior centuries, lonJ beIore they ran aIoul  oI
the Fremen:
   “When  reliJion  and Solitics ride  the same cart, when that cart is driven
by a livinJ holy man (baraka), nothinJ can stand in their Sath.”

     Appendix    III.    Report   on  Bene   Gesserit   MotiYesand     Purposes


        Here follows an exerpt from the Summa prepared by her own agents at the reTuest of the Lady
        Jessica immediately after the Arrakis Affair. The candor of this report amplifies its value far
        beyond the ordinary.
BECAUSE  THE   Bene Gesserit oSerated Ior  centuries  behind the  blind  oI a
semi-mystic   school   while   carryinJ   on   their   selective  breedinJ   SroJram
amonJ humans, we  tend to award them  with  more status than they  aSSear to
deserve. Analysis   oI  their  “trial   oI  Iact”  on  the  Arrakis   AIIair   betrays the
school’s SroIound  iJnorance  oI its own  role.
    It may  be arJued that  the Bene Gesserit could  e[amine   only such  Iacts as
were available  to them and had  no direct  access to the Serson oI the ProShet
Muad’Dib.   But  the  school  had  surmounted  Jreater  obstacles  and its  error
here Joes deeSer.
    The Bene Gesserit SroJram  had as its tarJet  the breedinJ  oI a Serson they
labeled  “Kwisatz    Haderach,”   a  term  siJniIyinJ    “one   who   can  be  many
Slaces at  once.”   In  simSler  terms,  what   they  souJht   was  a human   with
mental   Sowers   SermittinJ    him    to   understand    and   use  hiJher    order
dimensions.
    They were  breedinJ  Ior  a suSer-Mentat, a human  comSuter with   some oI
the Srescient  abilities   Iound  in   Guild  naviJators.   Now,  attend  these  Iacts
careIully:
    Muad’Dib,    born  Paul  Atreides,  was  the  son  oI  the  Duke  Leto,   a  man
whose  bloodline   had  been  watched   careIully   Ior   more  than  a  thousand
years. The  ProShet’s  mother,  Lady  Jessica, was  a  natural  dauJhter  oI  the
Baron   Vladimir    Harkonnen    and  carried   Jene-markers    whose  suSreme
imSortance  to the  breedinJ  SroJram   was known   Ior  almost  two  thousand
years. She was  a Bene  Gesserit  bred and  trained,  and should  have  been a
willing  tool  of the project.
    The Lady  Jessica was ordered  to Sroduce an Atreides  dauJhter.  The Slan
was to inbreed  this dauJhter  with  Feyd-Rautha  Harkonnen,  a neShew oI the
Baron Vladimir,   with   the hiJh  Srobability   oI a Kwisatz   Haderach Irom  that
union. Instead,  Ior  reasons she conIesses have never  been comSletely  clear
to her, the concubine  Lady Jessica deIied her  orders and bore a son.

564
   This  alone should have alerted the Bene Gesserit to the Sossibility that a
wild  variable  had entered their  scheme. But  there  were other  Iar  more
imSortant indications that they virtually iJnored:
       1. As  a youth, Paul Atreides  showed ability to  Sredict the Iuture. He
           was  known   to  have  had  Srescient visions   that  were  accurate,
           SenetratinJ, and deIied Iour-dimensional e[Slanation.
       2. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Bene Gesserit Proctor
           who  tested Paul’s humanity when  he was IiIteen,  deSoses that he
           surmounted more aJony in the test than any other human oI record.
           Yet she Iailed to make sSecial note oI this in her reSort!
       3.  When Family  Atreides  moved to  the  Slanet Arrakis, the  Fremen
           SoSulation there hailed the younJ Paul as a SroShet, “the voice Irom
           the outer world.”  The Bene Gesserit were well aware that the riJors
           oI  such a Slanet as Arrakis with its  totality  oI desert landscaSe, its
           absolute lack  oI  oSen water, its  emShasis on the  most  Srimitive
           necessities Ior  survival,  inevitably  Sroduces a hiJh  SroSortion oI
           sensitives. Yet this Fremen reaction and the obvious element oI the
           Arrakeen  diet hiJh  in  sSice were  Jlossed over  by Bene  Gesserit
           observers.
       4.  When  the  Harkonnens and  the  soldier-Ianatics oI  the  Padishah
           EmSeror reoccuSied Arrakis, killinJ   Paul’s Iather and most  oI the
           Atreides  trooSs,  Paul  and  his  mother  disaSSeared. But  almost
           immediately there were reSorts oI a new reliJious leader amonJ the
           Fremen, a  man called  Muad’Dib,   who  aJain was  hailed as  “the
           voice Irom  the outer world.”  The reSorts stated clearly that he was
           accomSanied by a  new  Reverend Mother  oI  the  Sayyadina Rite
           “who  is the woman who  bore him.”  Records available to the Bene
           Gesserit stated in Slain terms that the Fremen leJends oI the ProShet
           contained these words: “He shall be born oI a Bene Gesserit witch.”
               (It   may   be  arJued  here  that   the  Bene  Gesserit  sent  their
           Missionaria  Protectiva  onto  Arrakis   centuries earlier  to  imSlant
           somethinJ like  this leJend as saIeJuard should any members oI the
           school be traSSed there and reTuire sanctuary, and that this leJend oI
           “the voice Irom the outer world”  was SroSerly to be iJnored because
           it  aSSeared to be the standard Bene Gesserit ruse. But this would be
           true  only  iI  you  Jranted  that  the Bene  Gesserit were correct  in
           iJnorinJ  the other clues about Paul-Muad’ Dib.)

565
       5.  When   the  Arrakis  AIIair    boiled  uS,  the  SSacinJ Guild   made
           overtures to the Bene Gesserit. The Guild hinted that its naviJators,
           who use the sSice druJ oI Arrakis to Sroduce the limited Srescience
           necessary Ior JuidinJ  sSaceshiSs throuJh the void, were “bothered
           about the Iuture” or saw “Sroblems on the horizon.” This could only
           mean  they  saw a  ne[us,   a meetinJ  Slace  oI  countless delicate
           decisions, beyond which the Sath was hidden Irom the Srescient eye.
           This  was a clear indication  that some aJency was interIerinJ  with
           hiJher order dimensions!
   (A  Iew oI the Bene Gesserit had lonJ been aware that the Guild could not
interIere directly   with   the vital   sSice source  because Guild  naviJators
already were dealinJ in their own ineSt way with  hiJher order dimensions,
at least to the Soint where they  recoJnized that the sliJhtest missteS they
made on Arrakis  could  be  catastroShic. It was  a known  Iact  that Guild
naviJators could   Sredict no  way  to   take control   oI  the  sSice without
SroducinJ Must such a ne[us. The obvious conclusion was that someone oI
hiJher order Sowers was takinJ  control oI  the sSice source, yet the Bene
Gesserit missed this Soint entirely!)
   In  the Iace oI these Iacts, one is led to the inescaSable conclusion that the
ineIIicient  Bene Gesserit behavior in this aIIair  was a Sroduct oI  an even
hiJher Slan oI which they were comSletely unaware!

567
                            SHADDAM     IV  (10,  134—10,0)

The Padishah EmSeror, 81st oI  his  line  (House Corrino)   to occuSy  the
Golden Lion   Throne, reiJned  Irom  10,156  (date his  Iather,  Elrood  IX,
succumbed to chaumurky) until reSlaced by the 10,196 ReJency set uS in
the name oI his  eldest dauJhter, Irulan. His reiJn  is noted chieIly  Ior  the
Arrakis Revolt, blamed by many historians on Shaddam IV’s dalliance with
Court Iunctions and the SomS oI oIIice. The ranks oI BurseJs were doubled
in the Iirst si[teen  years oI his reiJn. ASSroSriations Ior Sardaukar traininJ
went down steadily in  the Iinal  thirty  years beIore the Arrakis Revolt.  He
had Iive dauJhters (Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, JosiIa, and RuJi) and no leJal
sons. Four oI  the dauJhters accomSanied him  into  retirement. His  wiIe,
Anirul, a Bene Gesserit oI Hidden Rank, died in 10,176.

568
                        LETO    A  TREIDES    (10,140—10,191)

A  distaII cousin  oI the  Corrinos, he  is IreTuently  reIerred to  as the Red
Duke. House Atreides ruled Caladan as a siridar-IieI Ior twenty Jenerations
until Sressured into the move to Arrakis. He is known chieIly  as the Iather
oI Duke  Paul Muad’Dib,   the Umma  ReJent. The remains oI  Duke  Leto
occuSy the “Skull Tomb” on Arrakis. His death is attributed to the treachery
oI  a  Suk   doctor,  and  is   an  act  laid   to  the  Siridar-Baron,   Vladimir
Harkonnen.

569
            LADY  JESSICA  (Hon.  Atreides)  (10,154—10,5)

A natural dauJhter (Bene Gesserit reIerence) oI the Siridar-Baron Vladimir
Harkonnen. Mother oI Duke  Paul Muad’Dib.  She Jraduated Irom the
Wallach IX B.G. School.

570
                           LADYALIA     ATREIDES    (10,191—)

LeJal  dauJhter oI  Duke  Leto  Atreides and  his  Iormal  concubine, Lady
Jessica. Lady Alia  was  born on  Arrakis  about  eiJht  months aIter  Duke
Leto’s death. Prenatal e[Sosure to  an awareness-sSectrum narcotic is the
reason Jenerally Jiven  Ior  Bene Gesserit reIerences to her as “Accursed
One.” She is known in SoSular history as St. Alia or  St. Alia-oI-the-KniIe.
(For a detailed history, see St. Alia, Huntress of a Billion Worlds by Pander
Oulson.)

571
                 VLADIMIR      HARKONNEN      (10,110—10,193)

Commonly reIerred  to as Baron  Harkonnen, his  title  is oIIicially   Siridar
(Slanetary Jovernor) Baron.  Vladimir   Harkonnen is  the  direct-line  male
descendant oI  the  Bashar  Abulurd  Harkonnen  who   was  banished Ior
cowardice aIter the  Battle oI  Corrin.  The return  oI  House Harkonnen to
Sower Jenerally is ascribed to adroit maniSulation oI the whale Iur market
and later  consolidation with   melanJe wealth  Irom  Arrakis.  The Siridar-
Baron died on  Arrakis  durinJ  the Revolt.  Title  Sassed brieIly to  the na-
Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

572
              COUNT    HASIMIR     FENRING    (10,133—10,5)

A  distaII  cousin  oI  House Corrino,  he  was  a childhood  comSanion oI
Shaddam IV. (The IreTuently discredited Pirate History of  Corrino  related
the curious story  that FenrinJ  was resSonsible Ior  the chaumurky which
disSosed oI Elrood IX.)   All  accounts aJree that  FenrinJ was  the closest
Iriend Shaddam IV  Sossessed. The ImSerial chores carried out by Count
FenrinJ included that oI  ImSerial AJent  on Arrakis durinJ  the Harkonnen
reJime there and later Siridar-Absentia oI Caladan. He Moined Shaddam IV
in retirement on Salusa Secundus.

573
                  COUNT    GLOSSU  RABBAN    (10,13-10,193)

Glossu Rabban, Count oI  Lankiveil,  was  the eldest neShew oI  Vladimir
Harkonnen. Glossu Rabban and Feyd-Rautha Rabban (who took the name
Harkonnen when chosen Ior the Siridar-Baron’s household) were leJal sons
oI the Siridar-Baron’s younJest demibrother, Abulurd.  Abulurd  renounced
the Harkonnen name and all riJhts  to  the title  when Jiven  the subdistrict
JovernorshiS oI Rabban-Lankiveil. Rabban was a distaII name.

                                 Afterword   by  Brian    Herbert


I  KNEW   Frank   Herbert  Ior  more   than  thirty-eiJht   years. He   was  a
maJniIicent human beinJ,  a man  oI Jreat  honor and distinction,  and the
most interestinJ Serson at any JatherinJ, drawinJ listeners around him like
a maJnet. To say he was an intellectual Jiant would be an understatement,
since he seemed to contain  all  oI  the knowledJe  oI  the  universe in  his
marvelous mind. He was my Iather, and I loved him deeSly.
   Nonetheless, a son’s Mourney to understand the leJendary author was not
always a smooth one, as I described in my bioJraShy oI  him, Dreamer  of
Dune. GrowinJ uS in  Frank Herbert’s household, I did  not understand his
need Ior absolute silence so that he could concentrate, the intense desire he
had to comSlete his imSortant writinJ   SroMects, or the conIidence he had
that one day his writinJ   would be a success, desSite the steady stream oI
reMections that he received. To my younJ eyes, the characters he created in
Dune and his other stories were the children oI his mind, and they comSeted
with me  Ior his  aIIections. In  the years it  took him  to write  his  maJnum
oSus, he sSent more time with Paul Atreides  than he did  with  me. Dad’s
study was oII-limits to me, to my  sister Penny, and to my brother Bruce. In
those days, only my mother Beverly really understood Dad’s comSle[ities.
Ultimately, it  was throuJh her love  Ior him,  and the love he Jave back to
her, that I came to see the nurturinJ, lovinJ side oI the man.
   By   that time  I   was in   my  mid-twenties,  havinJ  rebelled aJainst  his
e[actinJ ways Ior years. When I Iinally saw the soul oI my Iather and beJan
to aSSreciate him Ior the care he Jave my mother when she was terminally
ill, he and I became the best oI Iriends. He helSed me with my own writinJ
career by showinJ me what editors  wanted to see in books; he tauJht me
how to construct interestinJ characters, how to build susSense, how to keeS
readers turninJ the SaJes. AIter SerusinJ an early draIt oI  Sidney’s Comet
(which  would  become my  Iirst  Sublished novel),  he marked  uS several
SaJes and then wrote me  this  note: “These SaJes …  show how  editinJ
tiJhtens the story. Go now and do likewise.”   It was his way  oI tellinJ  me
that he could oSen the door Ior  me and let me Seek throuJh, but I  would
have to comSlete the immense labors involved with writinJ myselI.

614
   Beverly  Herbert was  the window  into  Frank Herbert’s soul. He  shared
that reality  with  millions  oI  readers when he  wrote a  lovinJ,  three-SaJe
tribute  to  her  at the  end  oI  Chapterhouse: Dune,  describinJ  their  liIe
toJether. His writinJ  comSanion and intellectual  eTual, she suJJested the
title Ior  that book, and she died in 1984 while he was writinJ  it.  Earlier in
Dune, Frank  Herbert  had modeled  Lady  Jessica Atreides aIter  Beverly
Herbert, with her diJniIied, Jentle ways oI inIluence, and even her Srescient
abilities,  which  my  mother actually  Sossessed. He also wrote oI   “Lady
Jessica’s latent (SroShetic) abilities,”  and  in  this  he was  describinJ  my
mother, thinkinJ oI all  the amazinJ Saranormal Ieats she had accomSlished
in her liIetime.  In an endearinJ tone, he oIten reIerred to her as his “white
witch,”  or Jood witch.  Similarly, throuJhout  the Dune series, he described
the heroic Ben Gesserit women as “witches.”
   Dune is the most admired science Iiction novel ever written and has sold
tens oI millions oI coSies all over the world, in more than twenty lanJuaJes.
It is to  science Iiction what the Lord  oI the RinJs  triloJy  is to Iantasy, the
most hiJhly reJarded, resSected works in their resSective Jenres. OI course,
Dune is not Must science Iiction. It includes stronJ elements oI Iantasy and
contains so many imSortant layers beneath the story line that it has become
a mainstream classic. As one dimension oI this, Must look at the cover on the
book in your hands, the Tuiet diJnity e[Sressed in the artwork.
   The  novel was Iirst  Sublished in  hardcover in 1965 by  Chilton  Books,
best known Ior their immense auto-reSair novels. No other Sublisher would
touch the book, in Sart because oI the lenJth oI the manuscriSt. They Ielt it
was Iar too lonJ at 215,000 words, when most novels oI the day were only a
Tuarter to a third that  lenJth. Dune would  reTuire immense SrintinJ costs
and a hiJh hardcover Srice Ior the time, in e[cess oI Iive dollars. No science
Iiction novel had ever commanded a retail Srice that hiJh.
   Publishers also e[Sressed concern about the comSle[ity oI the novel and
all oI  the new,  e[otic  words that  the author introduced in  the beJinninJ,
which tended to slow the story down. One editor said that he could not Jet
throuJh the Iirst  hundred SaJes without becominJ  conIused and irritated.
Another said that he miJht  be makinJ a huJe mistake in  turninJ the book
down, but he did so anyway.
   Initial  sales oI the book were slow, but Frank Herbert’s science Iiction—
writinJ  Seers and  readers recoJnized the  Jenius  oI  the work   Irom  the
beJinninJ, awardinJ it the coveted Nebula and HuJo awards Ior best novel

615
oI  the year. It  was  Ieatured in  The Whole  Earth  Catalog  and beJan to
receive e[cellent   reviews, includinJ   one  Irom  the  New  York Times.  A
Jroundswell oI suSSort was buildinJ.
   In  1969,  Frank  Herbert  Sublished the Iirst   seTuel, Dune Messiah,  in
which he warned about the danJers oI IollowinJ   a charismatic leader and
showed the dark side oI  Paul Atreides.  Many Ians didn’t   understand this
messaJe, because they didn’t want  to see their  suSerhero brouJht down
Irom  his Sedestal. Still,  the  book sold  well,  and so  did  its  Sredecessor.
LookinJ back at Dune, it is clear that Dad laid the seeds oI the troublesome
direction he intended to take with his hero, but a lot oI  readers didn’t want
to see it. John W. CamSbell, the editor oI  Analog who  made many useIul
suJJestions when Dune was beinJ  serialized, did not  like  Dune Messiah
because oI this Paul Atreides issue.
   HavinJ  studied Solitics  careIully,  my Iather  believed that heroes made
mistakes … mistakes that were  simSliIied  by the number  oI SeoSle who
Iollowed   such  leaders slavishly.   In  a   IoreshadowinJ  eSiJraSh, Frank
Herbert wrote in Dune:  “Remember, we sSeak now oI the Muad‘Dib  who
ordered battle drums made Irom  his  enemies’ skins,  the Muad’Dib   who
denied the conventions oI his ducal  Sast with a wave oI  the hand, sayinJ
merely: ‘I  am the  Kwisatz Haderach. That is  reason enouJh.’ ”  And in  a
dramatic scene, as Liet-Kynes lay dyinJ  in the desert, he remembered the
lonJ-aJo words oI  his own  Iather: “No  more terrible  disaster could beIall
your SeoSle than Ior them to Iall into the hands oI a Hero.”
   By  the early 1970s, sales oI Dune beJan to accelerate, larJely because the
novel  was heralded as  an  environmental handbook,  warninJ  about  the
danJers oI destroyinJ the Earth’s Iinite  resources. Frank Herbert sSoke to
more than 30,000  SeoSle at the Iirst  Earth  Day  in  PhiladelShia, and he
toured  the  country,   sSeakinJ  to   enthusiastic  colleJe  audiences.  The
environmental movement was sweeSinJ the nation, and Dad rode the crest
oI the wave, a  breathtakinJ triS. When he  Sublished Children of Dune in
1976, it  became a runaway bestseller, hittinJ  every  imSortant list  in  the
country.
   Children  of  Dune was the Iirst  science Iiction  novel  to become a New
York Times bestseller in both hardcover and SaSerback, and sales reached
into the millions. AIter  that, other science Iiction writers beJan to have their
own best-sellers, but Frank Herbert was the Iirst to obtain such a hiJh level
oI readershiS; he brouJht science Iiction out oI the Jhetto oI  literature. By

616
1979, Dune itselI  had  sold more  than 10  million  coSies, and sales keSt
climbinJ.  In  early  1985,  shortly  aIter  David  Lynch’s  movie  Dune  was
released, the SaSerback version oI the novel reached #1 on the New York
Times bestseller list. This  was  a Shenomenal accomSlishment, occurrinJ
twenty years aIter its Iirst Sublication, and sales remain brisk today.
 
 In 1957, Dad Ilew to the OreJon coast to write  a maJazine article about a
U.S. DeSartment oI AJriculture SroMect there, in which the Jovernment had
successIully Slanted Soverty Jrasses on the crests oI sand dunes, to keeS
them Irom  inundatinJ   hiJhways. He  intended  to  call  the  article  “They
StoSSed the MovinJ Sands,” but soon realized that he had a much biJJer
story on his hands.
   Frank  Herbert’s liIe  e[Seriences are layered into the SaJes oI the Dune
series, combined with an eclectic assortment oI IascinatinJ ideas that sSranJ
Irom his  researches. AmonJ other thinJs, the Dune universe is a sSiritual
meltinJ  Sot, a  Iar Iuture  in  which  reliJious  belieIs  have combined  into
interestinJ  Iorms.   DiscerninJ   readers will    recoJnize  Buddhism,   SuIi
Mysticism  and other  Islamic  belieI  systems, Catholicism, Protestantism,
Judaism, and Hinduism. In  the San Francisco Bay  Area,  my Iather  even
knew Zen Master Alan Watts, who lived on an old Ierryboat. Dad drew on a
variety  oI  reliJious   inIluences,  without  adherinJ  to  any  one  oI  them.
Consistent with this, the stated SurSose oI the Commission oI Ecumenical
Translators, as  described  in  an   aSSendi[  to  Dune,  was  to   eliminate
arJuments between reliJions, each oI which claimed to have “the  one and
only revelation.”
   When  he was a boy,  eiJht oI  Dad’s  Irish Catholic  aunts tried  to Iorce
Catholicism on him, but he resisted. Instead, this became the Jenesis oI the
Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. This Iictional orJanization would claim it did not
believe in orJanized reliJion, but the sisters were sSiritual nonetheless. Both
my Iather and mother were like that as well.
   DurinJ   the  1950s,  Frank  Herbert   was  a  Solitical  sSeechwriter  and
Sublicity  writer  Ior  U.S. senatorial and  conJressional candidates. In that
decade, he also  Mourneyed twice to Me[ico    with  his  Iamily,  where  he
studied desert conditions and croS cycles, and was subMected unwittinJly to
the eIIects oI a hallucinoJenic  druJ. All  oI  those e[Seriences, and a Jreat
deal Irom his childhood, Iound their way onto the SaJes oI Dune. The novel
became as comSle[ and multilayered as Frank Herbert himselI.

617
   As  I  said in Dreamer  of Dune, the characters in Dune  Iit  mytholoJical
archetySes. Paul is the hero Srince on a Tuest who weds the dauJhter oI a
“kinJ”  (he marries Princess Irulan, whose Iather is  the EmSeror Shaddam
Corrino  IV).  Reverend Mother  Gaius Helen  Mohiam  is  a witch   mother
archetySe, while Paul’s sister Alia is a virJin witch, and Pardot Kynes is the
wise old  man oI Dune  mytholoJy. Beast Rabban Harkonnen, thouJh evil
and aJJressive, is essentially a Iool.
   For  the names oI heroes, Frank Herbert selected Irom Greek mytholoJy
and other mytholoJical bases. The Greek House Atreus, uSon which House
Atreides in Dune was based, was the ill-Iated Iamily oI kinJs Menelaus and
AJamemnon. A  heroic Iamily,  it  was beset by traJic  Ilaws and burdened
with  a  curse Sronounced aJainst it   by  Thyestes. This  Ioreshadows the
troubles Frank  Herbert  had  in  mind  Ior   the Atreides  Iamily.   The  evil
Harkonnens oI Dune are  related to the  Atreides by  blood, so  when they
assassinate Paul’s Iather Duke Leto, it is kinsmen aJainst kinsmen, similar
to what occurred in the household oI AJamemnon when he was murdered
by his wiIe Clytemnestra.
   Dune is a modern-day conJlomeration oI Iamiliar  myths, a tale in which
Jreat sandworms Juard a Srecious treasure oI melanJe, the Jeriatric sSice
that reSresents, amonJ other thinJs, the Iinite  resource oI oil.  The  Slanet
Arrakis Ieatures immense, Ierocious worms  that are like  draJons oI  lore,
with “Jreat  teeth” and a “bellows breath oI cinnamon.”  This resembles the
myth described by  an unknown EnJlish  Soet in  Beowulf, the  comSellinJ
tale oI a Iearsome Iire draJon who Juarded a Jreat treasure hoard in a lair
under cliIIs, at the edJe oI the sea.
   The desert oI Frank Herbert’s classic novel is a vast ocean oI sand, with
Jiant worms divinJ  into the deSths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain
oI  Shai-Hulud.  Dune  toSs are  like  the  crests oI  waves,  and  there are
SowerIul sandstorms out there, creatinJ e[treme danJer. On Arrakis, liIe is
said to emanate Irom the Maker (Shai-Hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all
liIe on  Earth is believed to  have evolved Irom  our oceans. Frank Herbert
drew  Sarallels,  used  sSectacular metaShors, and   e[traSolated  Sresent
conditions into  world  systems that seem entirely alien  at Iirst  blush. But
close e[amination reveals they aren’t so diIIerent Irom systems we know …
and the book characters oI his imaJination are not so diIIerent Irom SeoSle
Iamiliar to us.

618
   Paul   Atreides  (who   is  the   messianic “Muad’Dib”     to  the   Fremen)
resembles Lawrence oI Arabia (T. E. Lawrence), a British  citizen who led
Arab Iorces in  a  successIul desert revolt aJainst the Turks  durinJ  World
War I.  Lawrence emSloyed Juerrilla  tactics to  destroy enemy Iorces and
communication lines, and came close to becominJ a messiah IiJure Ior the
Arabs. This historical event led Frank Herbert to consider the Sossibility oI
an outsider leadinJ native Iorces aJainst the morally corruSt occuSiers oI a
desert world, in the Srocess becominJ a Jodlike IiJure to them.
   One time I  asked my Iather iI he identiIied  with any oI  the characters in
his stories, and to my surSrise he said it was StilJar, the ruJJed leader oI the
Fremen. I had been thinkinJ oI Dad more as the diJniIied, honorable Duke
Leto, or the heroic, swashbucklinJ Paul, or the loyal Duncan Idaho. MullinJ
this over, I realized StilJar was the eTuivalent oI a Native American chieI in
Dune—a Serson who reSresented and deIended time-honored ways that did
not harm the ecoloJy oI the Slanet. Frank Herbert was that, and a Jreat deal
more. As a child, he had known a Native American who hinted that he had
been banished Irom his tribe, a man  named Indian Henry who  tauJht my
Iather some oI the ways oI his SeoSle, includinJ IishinJ,  the identiIication
oI edible and medicinal  Slants in the Iorest, and how to  Iind  red ants and
Srotein-rich Jrub worms Ior Iood.
   When  he set  uS the  desert Slanet oI  Arrakis  and the  Jalactic emSire
encomSassinJ it, Frank  Herbert  Sitted western culture  aJainst  Srimitive
culture and Jave the nod to the latter. In Dune he wrote, “Polish comes Irom
the cities; wisdom  Irom the  desert.” (Later, in  his mainstream novel Soul
Catcher, he would  do somethinJ similar  and would  Iavor  old  ways over
modern ways).  Like  the  nomadic Bedouins  oI  the Arabian  Slateau, the
Fremen live an admirable, isolated e[istence, seSarated Irom civilization by
vast stretches oI desert. The Fremen take Ssychedelic druJs durinJ reliJious
rites, like  the NavaMo Indians oI North  America.  And  like  the Jews, the
Fremen have been Sersecuted, driven to hide Irom authorities and survive
away Irom their  homeland. Both Jews and Fremen e[Sect to be led to the
Sromised land by a messiah.
   The words and names in Dune are Irom many tonJues, includinJ NavaMo,
Latin, Chakobsa (a lanJuaJe Iound in the Caucasus), the Nahuatl dialect oI
the Aztecs,  Greek, Persian, East Indian,  Russian, Turkish,  Finnish,  Old
EnJlish, and, oI course, Arabic.

619
   In  Children of Dune, Leto II allowed sandtrout to attach themselves to his
body, and this was based in Sart uSon my Iather’s own e[Seriences as a boy
JrowinJ uS in WashinJton State, when he rolled uS his trousers and waded
into a stream or lake, SermittinJ leeches to attach themselves to his leJs.
   The leJendary liIe  oI the divine suSerhero Muad’Dib is based on themes
Iound in a variety oI reliJious  Iaiths. Frank Herbert even used lore and bits
oI inIormation  Irom  the SeoSle oI  the Gobi  Desert in Asia,  the Kalahari
Desert in Southwest AIrica, and the aboriJines oI  the Australian Outback.
For centuries such SeoSle have survived on very small amounts oI water, in
environments where water is a more Srecious resource than Jold.
   The  Butlerian  Jihad,  occurrinJ  ten  thousand years beIore  the  events
described in Dune was a war  aJainst thinkinJ  machines who at one  time
had cruelly enslaved humans. For this reason, comSuters were eventually
made illeJal by  humans, as decreed in the OranJe Catholic Bible:  “Thou
shalt not make a machine in the likeness oI a human mind.” The roots oI the
Mihad went back to individuals my Sarents knew, to my mother’s JrandIather
CooSer Landis and  to  our  Iamily  Iriend  RalSh  Slattery, both  oI  whom
abhorred machines.
   Still,  there are comSuters in the Dune universe, lonJ aIter  the Mihad. As
the series  unIolds,  it   is  revealed  that  the  Bene Gesserits  have secret
comSuters to keeS track  oI  their  breedinJ records.  And  the Mentats  oI
Dune, caSable oI suSreme loJic, are “human comSuters.” In larJe Sart these
human calculators  were  based uSon my  Iather’s  Saternal Jrandmother,
Mary Stanley, an illiterate Kentucky hill-woman  who SerIormed incredible
mathematical calculations in her head. Mentats were the Srecursors oI Star
Trek’s SSock, First OIIicer oI the starshiS Enterprise … and Frank Herbert
described the danJers oI thinkinJ machines back in the 1960s, years beIore
Arnold SchwarzeneJJer’s Terminator movies.
   Remarkably, no aliens inhabit the Dune universe. Even the most e[otic oI
creatures, the mutant Guild NaviJators, are humans. So are the vile Jenetic
wizards, the Tleila[u,  and the Jholas Jrown in  their Ilesh vats. AmonJ  the
most unusual  humans to  sSrinJ  Irom  Frank  Herbert’s  imaJination,  the
women oI   the Bene  Gesserit Sisterhood  have a  collective  memory—a
conceSt based larJely uSon the writinJs and teachinJs oI Carl Gustav JunJ,
who sSoke oI  a  “collective  unconscious,” that  suSSosedly inborn set oI
“contents and modes oI behavior”  Sossessed by all human beinJs. These
were conceSts my Iather  discussed at lenJth  with  RalSh  Slattery’s wiIe

620
Irene, a  SsycholoJist who  had  studied with  JunJ  in  Switzerland  in  the
1930s.
   Frank Herbert’s liIe  reached a crescendo in the years aIter 1957, when he
Iocused his unusual e[Seriences and knowledJe on creatinJ his Jreat novel.
In the massive Siles oI books he read to research Dune, he recalled readinJ
somewhere that ecoloJy was the  science oI understandinJ conseTuences.
This was not his  oriJinal  conceSt, but as he learned Irom Ezra Pound, he
“made it new” and Sut it in a Iorm  that was Salatable to millions oI SeoSle.
With a worldview  similar  to that oI an American Indian,  Dad saw western
man inIlictinJ himselI on the environment, not livinJ in  harmony with it.
   DesSite all  the work  Dune reTuired, my  Iather said  it was  his Iavorite
book to write. He used what he called a “techniTue oI enormous detail,” in
which he studied and SreSared notes over a Iour year Seriod, between 1957
and 1961, then wrote and rewrote the book between 1961 and 1965.
   As  Dad e[Sanded and contracted the manuscriSt, deSendinJ uSon which
editor  was  JivinJ   him  advice,  an  error  Iound   its  way  into   the  Iinal
manuscriSt.  The  aJe   oI   EmSeror  Shaddam  Corrino    IV   is   sliJhtly
inconsistent in the novel, but it is one oI the Iew Jlitches in the entire Dune
series. This is remarkable, considerinJ the Iact that Frank Herbert wrote the
books on tySewriters …  more than a  million  words without  the  use oI a
comSuter to keeS all oI the inIormation straiJht.
   Late in 1961, in the midst oI his monumental eIIort, Dad Iired his literary
aJent Lurton BlassinJame, because he didn’t Ieel the aJent was suSSortive
enouJh and because he couldn’t  bear  the thouJht  oI  sendinJ  any more
stories into the New York SublishinJ industry, which had been reMectinJ him
Ior years. A couSle oI years later, when the new novel was nearly comSlete,
he Jot  back toJether  with  BlassinJame and  went throuJh  the  ordeal oI
reMection aIter reMection—more than twenty oI them—until Chilton Iinally
Sicked uS the  book and  Said an  advance oI $7,500  Ior  it.  II   not Ior  a
IarsiJhted editor at Chilton,  SterlinJ  Lanier, Dune miJht  never have been
Sublished, and world literature would be the Soorer Ior it.
 
 When my Iather and I became close in my adulthood and we beJan to write
toJether, he sSoke to me oIten  oI the  imSortance oI detail,  oI density  oI
writinJ. A  student oI SsycholoJy, he understood the subconscious, and liked
to say that Dune could  be read on any oI  several layers that were nested
beneath the adventure story oI a messiah on a desert Slanet. EcoloJy is the

621
most obvious  layer, but  alonJside that  are Solitics,  reliJion,  ShilosoShy,
history, human evolution, and even Soetry. Duneis a marvelous taSestry oI
words, sounds, and imaJes. Sometimes he wrote SassaJes in Soetry Iirst,
which he e[Sanded and converted to Srose, IorminJ sentences that included
elements oI the oriJinal Soems.
   Dad told  me that you could Iollow  any oI  the novel’s layers as you read
it, and then start the book all  over aJain, IocusinJ  on an entirely diIIerent
layer. At the end oI the book, he intentionally leIt loose ends and said he did
this to send the readers sSinninJ out oI the story with bits  and Sieces oI it
still clinJinJ  to them, so that they would want to Jo back and read it aJain.
A neat trick, and he Sulled it oII SerIectly.
   As  his eldest son, I  see Iamilial inIluences in  the story. Earlier, I  noted
that my mother is memorialized in Dune and so is Dad. He must have been
thinkinJ  oI himselI  when he wrote that Duke  Leto’s “Tualities  as a Iather
have lonJ  been overlooked.”  The  words  have deeS siJniIicance  to  me,
because at the time he and I were not JettinJ alonJ well at all. I was JoinJ
throuJh a rebellious teenaJe Shase, reactinJ to the uncomSromisinJ manner
in which he ruled the household.
   At  the beJinninJ oI  Dune, Paul Atreides is IiIteen  years old, around the
same aJe I was at the time the book was Iirst serialized in Analog. I do not
see myselI much in the characterization oI Paul, but I do see Dad in Paul’s
Iather, the noble Duke Leto Atreides. In one SassaJe, Frank Herbert wrote:
“Yet many Iacts oSen the way to this  Duke: his abidinJ  love Ior  his Bene
Gesserit lady; the  dreams he held  Ior  his son  …”  Late  in  his liIe,  Dad
resSonded to interview Tuestions about my own writinJ  career by sayinJ,
“The acorn doesn’t Iall  Iar Irom  the oak tree.” He oIten comSlimented me
to others, more than he did to me directly. To most oI his Iriends he seemed
like  an e[trovert,  but  in  Iamily  matters he was  oIten Tuite  the oSSosite,
SreIerrinJ to retire to his study. FreTuently, his stronJest emotions went on
the SaJe, so I oIten Ieel him sSeakinJ to me as I read his stories.
   Once, I  asked my Iather iI  he thouJht his  maJnum oSus would endure.
He said modestly that he didn’t know and that the only  valid literary  critic
was time.  Now   it  has  been Iorty   years  since Dune  was  Sublished in
hardcover, and Frank Herbert would be Sleased to know that interest in his
Iantastic novel, and the series it sSawned, has never waned. An entire new
Jeneration oI  readers is  SickinJ  uS Dune  and enMoyinJ it, Must as their
Sarents did beIore them.

622
   Like  our own universe, the universe oI Dune continues to e[Sand. Frank
Herbert wrote  si[   novels in   the series, and  I  have written  si[   more  in
collaboration with  Kevin  J. Anderson. Kevin  and I  have Iour more  Dune
books under contract, includinJ the chronoloJical Jrand Iinale that millions
oI Ians have been awaitinJ,  Dune 7.  Frank Herbert  was workinJ  on that
SroMect when he died in 1986, and it would have been the third book in a
triloJy  that he beJan with  Heretics of  Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune. In
those novels he set uS a Jreat mystery, and now, almost two decades aIter
his death, the solution is the most closely Juarded secret in science Iiction.
   By  the time we comSlete those stories, there will be si[teen Dune novels,
alonJ with  the  1984 movie  directed by  David  Lynch and  two  television
miniseries—“Frank  Herbert’s  Dune”  and  “Frank   Herbert’s  Children  oI
Dune”—both Sroduced by Richard Rubinstein. We envision other SroMects
in the Iuture, but all oI  them must measure uS to the loIty standard that my
Iather established with his own novels. When  all oI  the Jood stories have
been told,  the series will   end. But  that  will  not  really  be  a conclusion,
because we can always Jo back to Dune itselI and read it aJain and aJain.

Frank  Herbert    was born  in  Tacoma, WashinJton, and  educated at the
University  oI  WashinJton, Seattle. He  worked  a wide  variety  oI  Mobs—
includinJ TV  cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, MunJle survival
instructor,  lay  analyst,  creative writinJ    teacher, reSorter and  editor  oI
several West Coast newsSaSers—beIore becominJ a Iull-time writer.
 
 In 1952,  Herbert  beJan  SublishinJ  science  Iiction   with  “LookinJ    Ior
SomethinJ?” in  Startling  Stories. But  his  true  emerJence as a writer  oI
maMor stature did not occur until 1965, with the Sublication oI Dune. Dune
Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of  Dune, Heretics of Dune, and
Chapterhouse: Dune  Iollowed,   comSletinJ  the  saJa  that  the  Chicago
Tribune would  call  “one  oI  the  monuments oI  modern science Iiction.”
Herbert is also the author oI some twenty other books, includinJ The Jesus
Incident, The Dosadi Experiment, and Destination: Void. He died in 1986.

“The	standard	work	in	English	 on	the	Taliban.”
—Christopher	de	Bellaigue,	New	York	Review	of	Books

“Rashid	 spent	21	 years	 compiling	 the	 data	 and	interpretive	  materials	 in	 this
absorbing	and	 disquieting	 book….	  As	 the	world	  enters	an	 ominous	 stage	of
history,	Ahmed	 Rashid's	book	can	serve	as	an	excellent	primer,	 guide	book	and
briefng	of	what	the	future	 may	hold.”
—Arnold	 Ages,	Chicago	Jewish	Star

“A	 brilliant	   and	absorbing	 explanation	 of	 the	 radical	 Islamic	  movement	and
Afghanistan's	wretched	 situation,	Taliban	  became	required	reading	not	 just	for
journalists,	but	for	the	world's	 senior	politicians.”
—Alex	 Spillius,	Daily	 Telegraph

“An	 extensively	researched	analysis	by	a	noted	journalist….
A	fascinating	survey.”
—Joshua	Sinai,	Journal	of	Homeland	Security

“Taliban…	 provides	an	important	 perspective	untainted	by	excessive	emotion	or
jingoism.	Rashid's	is	 an	exceptional	book	that	sorts	out	 a	multitude	 of	questions
for	the	non–Central	Asian	specialist	 trying	to	make	sense	of	current	headlines….
Rashid's	acute	 foresight	  produced	 a	 book	 that—if	   taken	 seriously	 by	  U.S.
policymakers	at	 the	time	 it	 was	first	 published—	 might	 have	helped	 prevent	a
history-altering	catastrophe.”

—Middle	 East	Insight
“[Rashid	  is]	 Pakistan's	 best	 and	 bravest	 reporter.”	  —Christopher	  Hitchens,
Vanity	Fair

“This	is	 a	fine	book—erudite,	 concise,	sure-footed,	packed	with	information	 and
insight,	easy	to	read.	On	each	of	the	three	major	interrelated	themes	covered	here
—the	history	 of	 the	Taliban	 and	the	internal	 politics	 of	Afghanistan;	 Islam	 and
the	Taliban;	the	‘new	 Great	Game’	of	oil	 and	gas	in	Central	Asia—	 the	author	is
illuminating	 and	thorough.”

4
—Dilip	 Hiro,	 Middle	East	International

“[A]	  supremely	insightful	  book	 about	Afghanistan's	 Taliban	 regime….	 Rashid
bases	his	account	on	detailed	 reporting	 and	travel	 throughout	 Afghanistan	 and
interviews	with	 most	of	 the	Taliban's	elusive	 top	leadership.	As	a	narrative,	it	 is
gripping….	  Rashid's	book	 is	 superbly	 reported,	 a	 window	  into	 a	 world	 that
remains	largely	closed	to	American	eyes.”
—Shankar	Vedantam,	Philadelphia	Inquirer

“[A]	 thorough,	authoritative	 exegesis.”
—Peter	Bergen,	Washington	Post	Book	World

“Rashid	 marshals	 the	 vast	 amount	 of	 information	  he	 has	 accumulated	over
decades	of	covering	the	area	into	 a	long,	sad	story	 and	tells	it	 with	 finesse.	His
book	 is	 a	 gripping	  account	of	  one	 of	 the	 horror	 stories	 of	  post–Cold	 War
politics.”
—Jonathan	Groner,	Salon.com

“A	 brilliant	 work,	engrossing	and	wholly	 convincing.”
—Neville	 Maxwell,	 World	 Affairs

“Read	this	remarkable	 book	and	the	 bewildering	 complexity	 of	 Afghan	 politics
and	the	 deadly	 overspill	  of	 chaos,	narcotics,	 and	 sectarian	violence	 into	  the
surrounding	region	will	 become	clear.”
—Patrick	Seale,	Sunday	Times

                                               PREFACE
                                                  TO	   THE
                                     SECOND	      EDITION

	



I	find	it	extremely	humbling	that	in	this	era	of	consumerism	and	short	memories
my	book	on	the	Taliban	has	been	in	print	since	it	was	first	published	in	2000,	a
real	rarity	in	 today's	publishing	world.	The	book	 has	been	translated	into	26
languages	that	I	know	 about	–	 and	 new	pirated	translations	are	constantly
emerging.	I	recently	saw	an	Arabic	edition	that	was	published	in	Syria,	and	there
are	at	least	three	Persian	translations	in	circulation.
       In	the	English	language	about	1.5	million	copies	have	been	sold,	and	I	don't
know	how	many	have	sold	in	other	languages,	but	it	has	been	a	best	seller	in
countries	as	far	removed	from	Islamic	extremism	as	Brazil,	Poland	and	Japan.	I
am	still	being	asked	to	sign	dog-eared	copies	of	the	book	that	have	been	through
many	hands.
       With	 the	revived	 interest	and	concern	about	the	Taliban	 insurgency	in
Afghanistan	and	Pakistan,	I	expect	that	this	new	edition	will	first	 land	in	 the
hands	of	the	new	generation	of	journalists	covering	the	region.	It	will	be	read	by
officials	and	diplomats	who	were	still	at	college	on	11	September	2001	and,	I
hope,	by	new	generations	of	the	public.	Demand	for	the	book	has	been	kept	alive
by	students,	soldiers,	academics,	government	officials	and	the	man	and	woman
on	the	street	–	by	every	kind	of	reader,	young	and	old,	from	every	stratum	of
society.	It	is	a	tribute	to	my	readers	that	my	publishers	have	found	it	necessary
and	worthwhile	to	issue	this	updated	version	of	Taliban.
       This	book	is	the	last	item	that	is	packed	into	the	rucksacks	of	soldiers	from
many	US,	 British	  and	 NATO	 army	 units	 before	 they	 are	 transferred	to
Afghanistan,	and	every	soldier	–	not	just	the	officers	–	is	expected	to	read	it.
Every	incoming	freshman	at	a	prominent	university	in	a	northern	US	state	is
obliged	to	read	it	and	write	an	essay	on	it	before	the	start	of	regular	classes.	And
it	is	a	course	book	at	hundreds	of	universities	worldwide.	Many	students	say	that
this	was	the	first	book	they	read	that	was	not	a	thriller.
       As	a	result	of	the	book	I	have	been	asked	to	lecture	around	the	world.	With

12
the	Taliban	 upsurge	 in	 Pakistan,	a	 new	generation	 of	 Pakistani	 students	who
have	just	read	the	 book	ask	me	 to	come	and	 run	seminars	at	their	 universities,
even	though	 their	  teachers	do	 not	 all	 approve.	 The	 various	 pirated	 editions
published	in	Afghan	 languages	seem	to	have	been	read	by	every	Afghan	who	 is
remotely	literate.	 Muslim	 women,	 in	 particular,	 have	been	drawn	 to	this	 book,
perhaps	because	of	 what	  it	 tells	 them	 about	 the	 suffering	  of	 women	 in	  an
extremist	society.
       The	 book	has	been	banned	in	 Central	Asia	 because	of	my	 criticism	 of	 the
various	regimes	there	–	much	of	 which	 is	still	 valid.	 Yet	the	Russian	translation
was	an	underground	best	seller	in	Central	Asia.	It	is	 also	banned	in	Saudi	Arabia
for	a	 variety	 of	 religious	 and	political	  reasons,	but	there	was	 a	pirated	 Arabic
version	printed	 in	Lebanon	 that	did	 the	rounds	for	 some	years	so	clandestinely
that	I	never	had	a	chance	to	see	it.
       That	 it	 was	so	difficult	  to	get	this	 book	published	 in	the	late	 1990s	is	now
the	stuff	 of	legend.	 I	still	 remember	 agents	and	publishers	on	both	 sides	of	the
Atlantic	 asking,	 ‘Taliban	  who?’	 and	the	 story	 of	 George	W.	 Bush,	 before	he
became	president,	identifying	the	Taliban	as	an	all-girl	 pop	group.	The	Taliban	is
still	 the	butt	of	 endless	jokes,	rhyming	couplets,	 and	cartoons,	and,	of	course,	it
is	the	subject	 of	 hundreds	of	 books	and	articles	 published	since	 11	September
that	have	made	many	academics	instant	Taliban	 experts.	When	 this	book	 came
out	none	of	this	material	existed.
       The	 legacy	of	 11	September	is	still	 with	 us	in	 our	dreams	and	nightmares,
and	the	horror	that	was	 unleashed	that	day	still	 visits	Afghanistan,	 Pakistan	and
Central	Asia	 every	 day.	Despite	 the	billions	  of	 dollars	 spent,	the	 hundreds	of
lives	lost,	 the	myriad	 opportunities	 that	have	arisen,	 the	Taliban	 and	Al	 Qaeda
are	thriving	 and	pose	a	radical	 threat	to	 the	entire	 region.	The	 Afghan	 Taliban
have	spread	throughout	 the	 region;	 there	 are	now	  a	Pakistani	 Taliban	 and	 a
Central	Asian	 Taliban.	 The	Taliban	 itself-perhaps	 even	more	than	 Al	 Qaeda	–
has	become	a	role	model,	a	way	of	life	for	extremists	that	is	emulated	throughout
the	South	and	Central	Asia.	Eight	 years	after	11	September	neither	Muslims	 nor
Westerners	have	been	able	to	expunge	the	Taliban	 threat	or	 its	power	 as	a	role
model	for	  angry	 Islamicists.	 So	 the	Taliban	  way	 of	 life	 continues	 to	 seduce
youngsters	and	potential	suicide	bombers	in	the	region.
       When	 it	 was	decided	 to	bring	 out	 a	new	 edition	 of	 Taliban,	 I	 was	asked
whether	I	wanted	to	rewrite	 the	entire	book	 and	bring	each	chapter	up	to	date	or
simply	to	 add	a	new	chapter	that	 would	cover	 the	period	from	 2000		 to	2009.	I
chose	the	latter	because	I	felt	that	 this	was	a	book	 that	should	endure	as	it	is.	 It

13
was	essentially	 written	 as	a	piece	 of	 reportage	capturing	 a	historical	 moment;
much	of	it	was	written	 while	 I	was	literally	 in	 the	midst	of	the	Taliban	 in	the	late
1990s.	The	book	encapsulates	my	decades	covering	the	wars	in	Afghanistan,	the
people	I	met	there	and	the	background	knowledge	and	experience	I	acquired.
       In	 addition,	 the	book	offers	 something	of	 an	anthropological	 and	historical
study	of	the	evolution	of	 the	Afghan	tribes	and	ethnic	groups	even	as	the	country
itself	 was	  dissolving	  into	 a	  failed	  state.	It	  covers	  the	 geo-politics	  of	  the
neighbouring	countries	 during	 the	1990s	and	the	 way	 their	interference	 helped
keep	Afghanistan	divided	 while	the	USA	 and	western	Europe	fatally	ignored	 the
situation.	 If	  the	 West	 walks	 away	 from	  Afghanistan	 once	 again	 then	 those
regional	rivalries	will	  return,	plunging	the	country	into	 further	chaos.
       And	  finally,	   when	 it	  was	 published	 Taliban	  offered	  the	 first	  detailed
description	of	 what	Osama	Bin	 Laden	was	doing	in	 Afghanistan	 and	of	how	 he
was	taking	over	the	running	of	 the	country	in	 partnership	with	Mullah	 Omar,	 the
leader	of	 the	 Taliban;	  now,	 of	 course,	 analysing	 Bin	 Laden	 has	 become	an
industry.	For	 all	 these	reasons	I	have	 kept	the	 book	as	it	 was,	 even	though	 to
some	readers	the	story	 may	 appear	to	be	 dated	or	 the	facts	 not	fully	  filled	  in
because	we	know	so	much	more	now	about	that	pre-11	September	period.
       In	 the	new	chapter	I	 continue	the	story	of	 the	Afghan	 Taliban	and	examine
the	Pakistani	Taliban	 and	the	way	the	 two	have	affected	 Central	Asia.	 How	the
Taliban	 escaped	to	Pakistan	after	 the	defeat	 they	 suffered	in	 2001	 	is	 closely
linked	to	 how	they	survived	 in	Afghanistan	 despite	the	US	attack.	Today	 all	the
major	extremist	leaders	–	Osama	Bin	 Laden,	Mullah	 Omar,	Jalaluddin	 Haqqani,
Gulbuddin	 Hikmetyar	 –	 along	with	  a	number	of	 Pakistani	 Taliban	 leaders	are
living	 in	 the	Pakistani	borderlands.	The	 way	they	 got	there	is	 an	important	and
disturbing	story.	 Some	facts	in	the	 new	chapter	are	drawn	from	 my	 latest	book,
Descent	into	 Chaos:	The	 United	 States	and	the	 Failure	 of	 Nation	 Building	  in
Pakistan,	Afghanistan	 and	 Central	 Asia,	 which	 describes	events	in	 the	region
since	2001	and	explains	why	 the	Americans	 and	NATO	 have	failed	 so	badly	in
Afghanistan.
       I	 remain	 indebted	to	 my	 publishers,	I.BTauris	  and	Yale	 University	 Press,
for	keeping	the	book	 in	print	 for	so	long	 and	for	bringing	 out	 this	new	edition.	 I
could	not	 survive	 without	 Flip	 Brophy,	 my	 wonderful	 New	 York	  agent,	and	I
thank	Susan	Laity	for	 doing	 another	wonderful	job	 in	 editing	the	new	 chapter.	I
cannot	thank	 my	 family	 enough,	 especially	 my	 wife,	 Angeles,	 for	 putting	 up
with	all	 time	I	have	spent	away	or	at	my	desk.

                                                      AND
                             ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
                              TO	  THE	    FIRST	      EDITION

	



This	book	has	been	21	years	in	the	writing	–	about	as	long	as	I	have	covered
Afghanistan	as	a	reporter.	The	war	in	Afghanistan	has	taken	out	a	good	chunk	of
my	life	even	though	as	a	Pakistani	journalist	there	was	enough	going	on	at	home
to	report	on	and	later	 there	was	Central	Asia	and	the	collapse	of	the	 Soviet
Union	to	cover.
       Why	Afghanistan?	Anyone	who	has	been	touched	by	an	Afghan	or	visited
the	country	in	peace	or	in	war,	will	understand	when	I	say	the	country	and	the
people	are	amongst	the	most	extraordinary	on	earth.	The	Afghans	have	also	been
affected	by	one	of	the	greatest	tragedies	of	this	century	–	the	longest	running
civil	war	in	this	era	which	has	brought	untold	misery.
       Their	 story	and	 their	character	involve	 immense	contradictions.	Brave,
magnificent,	honourable,	generous,	hospitable,	gracious,	handsome,	Afghan	men
and	women	can	also	be	devious,	mean	and	bloody-minded.
       Over	the	centuries,	trying	to	understand	the	Afghans	and	their	country	was
turned	into	a	fine	art	and	a	game	of	power	politics	by	the	Persians,	the	Mongols,
the	British,	the	Soviets	and	most	recently	the	Pakistanis.	But	no	outsider	has	ever
conquered	them	or	claimed	 their	soul.	 Only	 the	Afghans	 could	have	 been
capable	of	keeping	two	empires	–	Britain	and	the	Soviet	Union	–	at	bay	in	this
century.	But	in	the	last	21	years	of	conflict	they	have	paid	an	enormous	price	–
over	1.5	million	dead	and	the	total	destruction	of	their	country.
       For	me,	luck	has	also	played	a	role	in	my	relationship	with	 Afghanistan.
Many	times	I	just	happened	to	be	at	the	right	place	at	the	right	time.	I	watched	as
army	tanks	blasted	their	way	into	the	Kabul	palace	of	Presid	ent	Mohammed
Daud	in	1978,	a	coup	that	was	to	set	off	Afghanistan's	disintegration.	A	year
later	I	was	sipping	tea	in	Kandahar's	bazaar	when	the	first	Soviet	tanks	rolled	in.
As	I	covered	the	Soviet	Union's	war	with	the	Mujaheddin	my	family	urged	me	to

16
write	a	 book,	as	so	many	journal	 ists	were	 doing	at	the	 time.	I	 abstained.	I	had
too	much	to	say	and	did	not	know	where	to	start.
       I	 was	determined	to	 write	 a	book	after	spending	several	months	 in	Geneva
covering	the	excruciating	 UN	sponsored	negotiations	in	1988,	which	 ended	with
the	Geneva	 Accords	 and	 the	withdrawal	  of	 Soviet	 troops	 from	  Afghanistan.
Packed	in	with	200	journalists	 I	was	fortunate	enough	to	be	privy	 to	many	of	 the
internal	 stand-offs	 between	 diplomats	  from	 the	 UNA,	  the	 USA,	  the	 Soviet
Union,	Pakistan,	Iran	 and	Afghanistan.	 That	book	 never	got	written	  as	my	first
love,	the	Afghans,	drove	 straight	from	 Geneva	into	a	bloody,	senseless	civil	war
that	still	continues	today.
       Instead	 I	 went	 to	 Central	 Asia	 to	 see	the	 ancestors	of	 the	 Afghans	 and
became	a	witness	 to	the	 collapse	of	 the	 Soviet	 Union,	 which	 I	 wrote	 a	 book
about	from	 the	perspective	of	 the	newly	 independent	Central	 Asian	 states.	But
Afghanistan	always	drew	me	back.
       I	 should	have	written	 another	book	 in	1992	 when	I	spent	a	month	 dodging
bullets	in	Kabul	 as	the	regime	of	President	Najibullah	 collapsed	and	the	city	 fell
to	 the	 Mujaheddin.	  By	  then	 the	  Afghan	  saga	had	 taken	  me	 to	 Moscow,
Washington,	Rome,	Jeddah,	Paris,	London,	Ashkhabad,	Tashkent	and	Dushanbe.
Ultimately	 it	was	the	unique	nature	of	the	Taliban	and	the	lack	of	 literature	about
their	meteoric	rise,	which	 convinced	me	I	had	to	tell	 their	story	as	a	continuation
of	the	last	21	years	of	Afghanistan's	history	and	my	history.
       For	  years	  I	  was	 the	  only	  Pakistani	  journalist	   covering	  Afghanistan
seriously,	 even	 though	  the	 war	  was	 next	 door	  and	 Afghanistan	  sustained
Pakistan's	foreign	policy	 and	kept	 the	military	 regime	 of	General	Zia	 ul	 Haq	in
power.	If	 there	 was	another	abiding	 interest,	 it	 was	my	 conviction	 as	early	 as
1982	that	 Islamabad's	 Afghan	 policy	  would	 play	 a	 critical	 role	 in	  Pakistan's
future	national	 security,	 domestic	politics	 and	create	an	 Islamic	 fundamentalist
backlash	at	home.	Today,	as	Pakistan	teeters	on	the	edge	of	a	political,	economic
and	social	 abyss	while	  a	culture	 of	  drugs,	weapons,	 corruption	 and	 violence
permeates	the	country,	 what	 happens	 in	 Afghanistan	 has	become	 even	more
important	to	Pakistan.
       Pakistan's	policy-makers	 did	not	always	agree	with	 what	I	wrote.	 It	was	not
easy	to	disagree	with	Zia.	 In	 1985	I	 was	interrogated	for	 several	hours	by	Zia's
intelligence	 agencies	and	warned	 not	 to	 write	 for	  six	 months	because	of	 my
criticism.	 I	 continued	to	 write	 under	 pseudonyms.	My	 phones	were	constantly
tapped,	my	movements	monitored.
       Afghanistan,	 like	  the	Afghans	 themselves,	is	 a	country	 of	 contradic	tions

17
that	 are	constantly	 played	  out	 for	 any	 reporter.	 Gulbuddin	  Hikme	  tyar,	 the
extremist	 Mujaheddin	 leader	 sentenced	me	 to	 death	 for	  being	 a	 communist
sympathiser	–	along	with	 George	Arney	 of	 the	BBC	 –	and	for	 a	year	published
my	name	 in	 his	party	 newspaper,	like	 a	 wanted	ad.	 Later,	 in	 Kabul,	 a	crowd
chased	and	tried	 to	 kill	  me	 when	 I	 arrived	 moments	 after	 a	rocket	 fired	  by
Hikmetyar	 had	killed	  two	 small	boys	 in	 the	Mic	 royan	 housing	 complex.	The
Afghans	thought	I	was	a	Hikmetyar	 agent	checking	out	the	damage.
       In	 1981	 when	 Najibullah	  was	head	of	 the	 notorious	 KHAD,	  the	Afghan
communist	secret	service	modelled	on	 the	KGB,	 he	personally	interrog	 ated	me
after	KHAD	 officers	 arrested	me	for	reading	a	banned	copy	of	Time	magazine	at
Kabul's	 Post	 Office.	 After	  he	 became	 president	and	 I	  had	interviewed	  him
several	times,	he	thought	I	could	carry	a	conciliatory	 message	from	him	to	Prime
Minister	Benazir	 Bhutto.	I	told	 him	she	would	not	listen	 to	me,	and	she	did	not.
       And	  many	 times	 I	 have	 been	caught	 in	 the	 contradiction	  of	 crossfires,
between	 Afghan	   communist	  troops	   and	 the	   Mujaheddin,	  between	  rival
Mujaheddin	 warlords	and	between	the	 Taliban	and	Ahmad	 Shah	Masud's	tank-
gunners.	I	have	never	been	the	warrior	type	and	mostly	ducked.
       My	 interest	 in	Afghanistan	 could	 not	have	been	sustained	without	the	 help
of	many	people,	above	all	the	Afghans.	 To	the	Taliban	 mullahs,	the	anti-Taliban
commanders,	the	warlords	who	went	before	them,	 the	warriors	on	the	battlefield
and	 the	 taxi-drivers,	  intellectuals,	  aid-workers	 and	  farmers	 –	 too	  many	 to
mention	and	mostly	too	sensitive	to	mention	–	my	 many	thanks.
       Apart	 from	 the	 Afghans	 I	have	received	 the	greatest	help	 from	 Pakis	tani
ministers,	diplomats,	 generals,	bureaucrats	and	intelligence	 officers,	 who	either
wanted	to	take	me	on	or	were	sincerely	sympathetic	 to	my	views.	 Many	of	 them
have	become	firm	friends.
       Over	   the	  years	   the	  UN	   agencies	  and	  the	  non-governmental	   aid
organizations	have	provided	a	home	for	 me	all	over	Afghanistan	 and	have	given
me	ideas,	 information	  and	 support.	 At	  the	 UN	 Office	  for	  Co-ordination	  of
Humanitarian	 Assistance	to	 Afghanistan	 I	 owe	 many	 thanks	to	 its	 successive
chiefs,	Martin	 Barber,	Alfredo	 Witschi-Cestari	 and	Erick	 de	Mul	and	to	 Brigette
Neubacher,	who	has	been	in	the	Afghan	business	almost	as	long	as	I	have.	At	the
UN	High	 Commission	for	 Refugees	I	thank	Robert	Van	Leeuwen,	Shamsul	Bari,
Sri	 Wijaratne,	 Jacques	Muchet,	 Rupert	 Colville	  and	 Monique	 Malha.	  At	 the
World	 Food	 Programme	the	 indefatigable	 Adan	 Adar	 understood	the	 Taliban
better	than	any	other	UN	officer.
       At	 the	UN	 Special	Mission	 for	Afghanistan	 many	thanks	are	due	to	Francis

18
Okelo,	 James	Ngobi,	 Hiroshi	  Takahashi,	 Arnold	  Schifferdecker	 and	 Andrew
Tesoriere	and	at	the	UN	 in	 New	 York,	 Benon	Sevan	and	 Andrew	 Gilmour.	 At
the	International	Committee	 of	the	Red	Cross,	Thomas	Gurtner	and	Oliver	 Durr,
at	Acted	aid	agency	Frederick	 Rousseau	and	Marie	Pierre	Caley	and	at	Save	the
Children	 Andrew	 Wilder	  and	 Sofe	 Elieussen.	The	 friendship	  and	support	 of
Lakhdar	  Brahimi,	  the	  UN	   Secretary	 General's	  Special	 Representative	  to
Afghanistan	has	been	crit	ical	to	this	work.
       For	 16	years	I	have	reported	on	Afghanistan	for	 the	Far	 Eastern	Eco	nomic
Review	and	I	 owe	 my	editors,	 especially	 Nayan	Chanda,	enormous	 thanks	for
giving	 me	 space	in	 the	 magazine,	 travel	 funds	 and	 sustaining	an	 interest	 in
running	stories	from	 what	has	now	become	an	obscure	war	on	the	edge	of	 Asia.
The	former	 foreign	 editor	 V.G	 Kulkarni	  took	 a	huge	 risk	 when	he	 convinced
sceptical	 bosses	that	 my	  1997	 story	 on	  the	 oil	  and	 gas	pipeline	  battle	 in
Afghanistan	and	Central	 Asia	was	worthy	 of	 a	cover	story.	From	 that	story	was
to	emerge	 the	 now	 common	 phrase,	‘the	 new	 Great	 Game’.	 Foreign	 editors
Andrew	Waller	 and	Andrew	Sherry	have	continued	that	tradition.
       My	 thanks	to	 the	Daily	 Telegraph's	successive	foreign	editors	Nigel	 Wade,
Patrick	  Bishop	  and	  Stephen	  Robinson	  for	   not	  totally	   forgetting	   about
Afghanistan.	And	 to	 fellow	  journalists	and	 friends	 at	the	BBC	 World	  Service,
Radio	France	International	and	Radio	Australia	 for	 con	stantly	letting	 me	air	my
views.
       In	 Pakistan,	Arif	  Nizami,	 editor	 of	the	 Nation	 has	stood	by	me	 as	I	wrote
reams	on	Afghanistan.	He	always	 gave	me	front	page	space	and	he	always	took
the	 fak,	  fielding	  phone	 calls	  from	  invariably	   angry	 Pakistani	  government
officials.	 Sherry	Rehman,	former	editor	of	 the	Herald	 also	allowed	me	to	fill	  her
magazine	with	my	photographs	and	stories.
       This	 could	 not	have	been	accomplished	without	 the	enormous	support	 and
friendship	 –	not	 to	speak	of	 the	website	 –	of	 Barnett	Rubin,	 who	 knows	 more
about	Afghanistan	than	anyone	I	know.	I	 owe	heartfelt	thanks	to	the	Afghanistan
brigade	of	 scholars,	journalists	 and	human	rights	 activists	 who	 like	 me	cannot
leave	the	story	 and	 from	 whom	 I	 have	learnt	 so	much	 –	 Olivier	  Roy,	Nancy
Hatch	Dupree,	Ashraf	Ghani,	William	  Maley,	Anders	Fange,	Citha	Maass,	Eqbal
Ahmad,	Patti	Gossman,	Abbas	Faiz,	Steve	Levine,	Tony	Davis,	 Edward	Giradet,

Yousufzai,	 Leslie	 Cockburn,	 Francois	Chipaux,	 Jennifer	 Griffin	  and	Gretchen
Peters.
       I	 am	deeply	grateful	to	 Cathy	Gannon,	the	bureau	chief	of	Associated	Press

19
in	Islamabad	and	 Kabul,	who	 deserves	several	Pulitzer	 Prizes	for	 her	excellent
coverage	over	the	years,	not	to	speak	of	her	gener	osity	 and	modesty.	My	 many
thanks	 to	 successive	 Reuters	 bureau	 chiefs	 in	  Islamabad,	 Jane	Macartney,
Alistair	 Lyon	 and	Andy	Hill.	  Many	thanks	to	 Sarah	Hunt	Cooke,	my	 editor	at	I.
B.	 Tauris	 who	 believed	  in	 the	 project	 from	  the	 start	 and	 was	patient	  with
deadlines.
       This	  book	 could	 not	 have	 been	 written	 without	  the	 patience,	 love	 and
understanding	of	my	 wife	 Angeles	and	my	 two	 children,	who	 have	put	up	 with
my	wanderings	and	absences	and	have	shared	my	feelings	for	Afghanistan	 for	a
long	time.

                                      INTRODUCTION:
                              AFGHANISTAN'S	              HOLY
                                             WARRIORS

	



On	  a	 warm	 spring	afternoon	 in	 the	 southern	city	  of	 Kandahar,	Afghan
shopkeepers	were	pulling	down	their	shutters	in	preparation	for	the	weekend.
Heavy-set	Pashtun	tribesmen	with	long	beards	and	black	turbans	tied	tightly
around	their	heads	made	their	way	through	the	narrow,	dusty	alleyways	to	the
city's	football	stadium	just	 beyond	the	main	bazaar.	Children,	many	of	them
orphaned	and	in	rags,	ran	up	and	down	the	alleys,	gesticulating	and	shouting
with	excitement	at	the	thought	of	the	spectacle	they	were	about	to	witness.
       It	 was	March	1997	and	for	two	and	a	half	 years	Kandahar	had	been	the
capital	of	the	fierce	Taliban	Islamic	warriors,	who	had	conquered	two-thirds	of
Afghanistan	and	were	now	battling	to	conquer	the	rest	of	the	country.	A	handful
of	Taliban	had	fought	the	Soviet	Red	Army	in	the	1980s,	more	had	fought	the
regime	of	President	Najibullah	who	had	hung	on	to	power	for	four	years	after
Soviet	troops	withdrew	from	 Afghanistan	in	1989,	but	the	vast	majority	 had
never	fought	the	communists	and	were	young	Koranic	students,	drawn	from
hundreds	of	madrassas	(Islamic	theology	schools)	that	had	been	set	up	in	Afghan
refugee	camps	in	Pakistan.
       Since	their	dramatic	and	sudden	appearance	at	the	end	of	1994,	the	Taliban
had	 brought	 relative	 peace	and	 security	 to	  Kandahar	and	 neighbouring
provinces.	Warring	tribal	groups	had	been	crushed	and	their	leaders	hanged,	the
heavily	armed	population	 had	been	disarmed	and	 the	roads	were	 open	to
facilitate	the	lucrative	smuggling	trade	between	Pakistan,	Afghanistan,	Iran	and
Central	Asia	which	had	become	the	mainstay	of	the	economy.
       The	Taliban,	drawn	from	the	majority	Pashtun	ethnic	group	which	accounts
for	some	40	per	cent	of	Afghanistan's	20	million	 people,	had	also	galvanized
Pashtun	nationalism.	The	Pashtuns	had	ruled	Afghanistan	for	300	years	but	had
recently	lost	 out	to	 the	 country's	other	smaller	ethnic	 groups.	The	Taliban
victories	 revived	 hopes	 that	  once	 again	 the	 Pashtuns	 would	 dominate

23
Afghanistan.
       But	  the	 Taliban	 had	 also	implemented	  an	extreme	 interpretation	 of	  the
Sharia	or	Islamic	 law	 that	appalled	 many	Afghans	 and	the	Muslim	  world.	 The
Taliban	had	closed	down	 all	girls’	  schools	and	women	were	rarely	 permitted	 to
venture	out	 of	their	 homes,	even	 for	 shopping.	The	 Taliban	had	 banned	every
conceivable	 kind	 of	 entertainment	 including	  music,	 TV,	  videos,	 cards,	 kite-
flying	   and	  most	   sports	  and	  games.	  The	   Taliban's	   brand	  of	   Islamic
fundamentalism	was	so	extreme	that	it	 appeared	to	denigrate	Islam's	message	of
peace	and	tolerance	 and	 its	 capacity	 to	 live	  with	 other	 religious	  and	ethnic
groups.	They	 were	to	 inspire	 a	new	 extremist	 form	 of	 fundamentalism	 across
Pakistan	and	Central	Asia,	which	refused	to	compromise	with	 traditional	 Islamic
values,	social	structures	or	existing	state	systems.
       A	 few	 weeks	earlier	 in	Kandahar	 the	Taliban	 had	lifted	 their	longstanding
ban	on	football.	The	United	 Nations	(UN)	 aid	agencies	–	seizing	a	rare	chance	to
do	something	for	public	 entertainment	–	rushed	in	to	rebuild	 the	stands	and	seats
of	the	bombed	out	football	 stadium.	But	 on	this	balmy	 Thursday	afternoon	–	the
beginning	of	 the	Muslim	  weekend	-no	foreign	 aid-workers	 had	been	invited	 to
watch	 the	stadium's	 inauguration.	 No	  football	 match	 was	 scheduled.	Instead
there	was	to	 be	a	public	 execution	 and	the	 victim	 was	to	 be	shot	 between	the
goalposts.
       I	 had	just	got	off	 a	UN	 plane	arriving	 from	Pakistan	and	was	told	 about	the
execution	in	 hushed	tones	by	 depressed	and	embarrassed	foreign	 aid-workers.
‘This	is	not	exactly	 going	to	encourage	the	international	community	 to	give	more
funds	for	aid	projects	in	 Afghanistan.	How	 do	we	explain	the	use	the	Taliban	are
putting	our	renovation	of	 the	football	stadium	to?’	 said	one	Western	aid-worker.
       They	 also	looked	nervously	 at	my	 colleague	Gretchen	Peters,	an	American
journalist.	A	 tall,	 lanky	blonde	with	 a	broad	face	and	chiselled	 features,	she	was
dressed	in	 a	one-size-too-small	 shalwar	 kameez	–	 the	 local	 dress	comprising
baggy	cotton	pants,	a	long	shirt	that	extended	to	below	 the	knee	and	a	long	scarf
that	covered	her	head.	But	that	did	 not	hide	 her	height	or	her	 striking	 American
looks,	which	  posed	a	threat	 to	 every	concept	 the	 Taliban	 held	–	 that	 women
should	 be	 neither	 seen	nor	  heard	 because	they	 drove	 men	 away	  from	 the
proscribed	Islamic	  path	 and	 into	 wild	  temptation.	 Whether	 it	 was	 a	 fear	 of
women	or	their	abhorrence	of	 femininity,	 Taliban	 leaders	had	frequently	refused
to	give	interviews	to	 female	journalists.
       Ever	 since	the	winter	of	1994,	when	the	mysterious	Taliban	 first	emerged	to
conquer	Kandahar	and	then	swept	north	 to	capture	Kabul	 in	 September	1996,	I

24
had	been	reporting	on	the	Taliban	phenomenon,	making	more	 than	a	dozen	trips
to	Taliban	strongholds	in	Kandahar,	Herat	and	Kabul.	I	 was	even	more	interested
in	 trying	  to	 get	 to	  grips	 with	  who	 they	  were,	 what	 motivated	  them,	 who
supported	them	and	how	they	 had	arrived	at	 this	violent,	 extreme	interpretation
of	Islam.
       Now	 here	there	was	another	Taliban	surprise,	both	a	nightmare	and	a	gift	to
any	 reporter	 –	 a	 horrific	   event	 that	 made	 me	 tremble	 with	  both	 fear	  and
anticipation.	I	had	witnessed	much	death	during	the	years	of	war,	but	that	did	 not
make	it	 any	easier	to	be	 a	spectator	at	the	execution	 of	 a	fellow	 human	 being.
And	to	 view	 it	 as	an	entertainment,	shared	with	 thousands	of	people	and	 as	an
expression	of	Islamic	justice	and	Taliban	control,	 was	harder	still.
       At	 the	stadium	the	Taliban	 first	 resisted	our	entry	but	then	allowed	 me	in	if
I	stood	 quietly	 at	the	 touch-line	 and	promised	not	 to	 talk	 to	anyone.	Gretchen
Peters	slipped	in,	but	she	was	quickly	 ousted	by	a	posse	of	panic-stricken	armed
Taliban	 guards	who	 nudged	her	 in	 the	back	 with	 their	 kalashnikov	 automatic
rifles.
       By	 mid-afternoon	 every	seat	in	the	stadium	 was	taken	as	more	than	10,000
men	and	children	  packed	the	 stands	and	overflowed	 on	 to	 the	sandy	 football
pitch.	Children	played	 games	of	dare	by	running	on	to	the	pitch	before	they	were
pushed	back	behind	 the	 touch-line	 by	 angry	 guards.	It	 seemed	as	though	 the
whole	 city's	  male	  population	  had	 turned	  up.	  Women	 were	  banned	 from
appearing	at	any	public	events.
       Suddenly	 the	 roar	 of	 the	 crowd	  subsided	as	two	  dozen	armed	 Taliban,
wearing	 plastic	 flip-flop	   sandals,	black	 turbans	 and	the	 male	 version	 of	  the
shalwar	kameez,	came	charging	onto	the	pitch.	They	ran	alongside	the	touch-line
pushing	the	 playful	  children	 back	 into	 the	 stands	with	  their	 gun	 barrels	and
yelling	 to	the	crowd	 to	 be	silent.	As	 the	crowd	 quickly	 obeyed,	the	only	 sound
was	the	Taliban's	flip-flops.
       Then,	  as	if	  on	 cue,	 several	 Datsun	 two-door	  pick-ups	 –	  the	 Taliban's
favourite	 mode	  of	 transport	  –	 drove	 onto	  the	 football	  pitch.	  One	 pick-up
sprouted	a	tinny	sounding	loudspeaker	–	the	kind	 seen	on	thousands	of	mosques
in	Pakistan	and	Afghanistan.	 An	elderly	 man	with	 a	white	beard	stood	up	in	 the
vehicle	and	began	to	 lecture	the	crowd.	 Qazi	Khalilullah	  Ferozi,	 a	judge	of	 the
Taliban's	 Supreme	Court	 of	 Kandahar	 spoke	 for	 over	 an	 hour,	 extolling	  the
crowd	  on	 the	  virtues	  of	  the	 Taliban	  movement,	  the	 benefits	  of	  Islamic
punishment	and	a	full	history	of	 the	case.
       Abdullah	  Afghan,	  a	 young	  man	 in	 his	 early	  20s	 had	 allegedly	 stolen

25
medicines	from	 Abdul	 Wali,	 a	 farmer	who	 lived	 in	 their	 common	village	 near
Kandahar.	When	Wali	resisted,	Abdullah	 had	shot	him	dead.	After	several	weeks
of	searching	for	 him,	 Wali's	 relatives	tracked	Abdullah	 down,	 arrested	him	and
bought	him	to	the	Taliban	 for	justice.	Abdullah	 was	tried	and	sentenced	to	death,
first	by	 the	Islamic	 High	 Court	 of	Kandahar	and	 then	on	appeal	by	the	 Taliban
Supreme	 Court.	 These	  were	 trials	  without	  lawyers	  where	  the	 accused	 is
presumed	guilty	and	expected	to	defend	himself.
       The	 Taliban's	 interpretation	  of	 the	 Sharia	or	  Islamic	 law	 demanded	the
execution	of	 the	murderer	 by	 the	victim's	 family,	  but	 not	before	 a	last-minute
appeal	is	made	by	 the	 judge	to	 the	victim's	  relatives	to	 spare	the	murderer.	 If
they	granted	mercy	the	victim's	 family	 would	 receive	blood	 money	or	monetary
compensation.	But	how	much	of	this	 interpretation	of	 Islamic	law	 by	the	Taliban
is	owed	 to	 the	 Sharia	 and	how	 much	 is	 owed	 to	 the	Pashtun	 tribal	 code	 of
behaviour	or	Pashtunwali,	is	what	is	disputed	by	 many	Muslim	 theologians,	both
inside	Afghanistan	and	beyond.
       By	 now	some	20	male	relatives	of	 the	victim	 had	appeared	on	the	pitch	and
the	Qazi	 turned	to	 them.	Raising	 his	 arms	to	 the	sky,	 he	appealed	to	 them	 to
spare	the	life	of	 Abdullah	 in	exchange	for	 blood	money.	‘You	 will	  go	to	Mecca
ten	times	if	you	 spare	this	man.	Our	leaders	have	promised	to	pay	a	huge	sum	to
you	from	the	Baitul	 Mal	 [Islamic	 fund]	 if	you	 forgive	him,’	 he	told	 the	relatives.
As	the	relatives	all	 shook	their	heads	in	refusal,	the	Taliban	 guards	pointed	their
guns	at	the	crowd	and	warned	that	 they	would	 shoot	anyone	who	moved.	There
was	silence	in	the	stands.
       Abdullah,	 who	 had	been	seated	throughout	the	proceedings	in	another	pick-
up	guarded	by	armed	Taliban,	was	now	let	out.	Wearing	a	bright	 yellow	 skullcap
and	new	clothes,	his	feet	shackled	with	heavy	manacles,	his	arms	chained	behind
his	back,	he	was	told	to	walk	 to	the	goalposts	at	one	end	of	the	stadium.	His	legs
visibly	 shook	with	 fear	 as	he	shuffled	across	the	pitch,	 his	chains	 clanking	and
glinting	 in	the	sunlight.	When	he	reached	the	goalposts,	he	was	made	to	kneel	on
the	ground	with	his	 face	turned	away	from	the	crowd.	 A	guard	whispered	to	him
that	he	could	say	his	last	prayer.
       A	  guard	handed	a	 kalashnikov	 to	a	 relative	 of	 the	murdered	 victim.	 The
relative	swiftly	  stepped	up	 to	Abdullah,	  cocked	the	automatic	 and	from	 a	 few
feet	away	shot	him	 three	times	in	 the	back.	As	 Abdullah	 fell	 on	to	his	 back	the
executioner	 moved	 alongside	 his	  twitching	  body	  and	 at	 point-blank	  range
pumped	three	more	bullets	 into	his	 chest.	Within	 seconds	his	body	 was	thrown
into	 the	back	 of	 a	 pick-up	 and	driven	 away.	 The	 crowd	 quickly	  and	silently

26
dispersed.	As	we	 drove	 back	into	 town,	 thin	 slivers	 of	 smoke	 arose	from	 the
bazaar	as	tea	stalls	and	kebab	stands	lit	up	for	their	evening	trade.
       A	 mixture	 of	 fear,	acceptance,	total	exhaustion	and	 devastation	after	years
of	war	and	more	 than	1.5	million	 dead	have	forced	 many	Afghans	to	 accept	the
Taliban	ways	 of	 justice.	 The	next	 day	 in	 a	village	 near	 Kabul,	 a	woman	 was
stoned	to	 death	 by	 a	 baying	 crowd	 after	 being	 sentenced	for	  trying	  to	 flee
Afghanistan	with	 a	man	 who	was	not	 her	blood	 relative.	Amputations	 of	 either
one	hand	 or	 one	foot	  or	 both	 are	common	 Taliban	  punishments	for	  anyone
caught	stealing.	When	 they	 captured	Kabul	 in	 September	1996,	 to	be	 initially
welcomed	as	liberators,	many	Kabulis	and	the	world	 turned	away	in	disgust	after
the	Taliban	 tortured	and	then	 publicly	 hanged	former	 President	Najibullah,	  the
ex-communist	strongman	who	for	 four	years	had	been	living	 in	a	UN	 compound
under	UN	protection.
       Since	 the	end	of	 the	Cold	 War	no	 other	political	 movement	 in	the	 Islamic
world	 has	attracted	as	much	attention	 as	the	Taliban	 in	 Afghanistan.	For	 some
Afghans	 the	 Taliban	 created	 hopes	that	 a	 movement	 led	 by	 simple	  Islamic
students	with	  an	agenda	of	  bringing	 peace	 to	 the	country	  might	 succeed	in
finally	 disposing	 of	 the	 warlord	  factions	 which	 had	devastated	people's	 lives
since	the	communist	regime	in	Kabul	had	been	overthrown	in	 April	 1992.	Others
feared	that	 the	 Taliban	  movement	 would	 quickly	  degenerate	into	  one	 more
warlord	 faction,	 determined	 to	 thrust	 despotic	 rule	 upon	 the	 hapless	Afghan
people.
       The	 Pashtun	Taliban	have	also	brought	the	question	of	inter-ethnic	relations
in	a	multi-ethnic	 state	to	the	 forefront,	 as	well	as	other	issues	including	 the	role
of	  Islam	  versus	  clan,	  tribal	  and	  feudal	  structures	  and	 the	  question	  of
modernization	 and	 economic	 development	 in	 a	 conservative	Islamic	  society.
Understanding	the	Taliban	 phenomenon	is	made	even	more	difficult	  because	of
the	excessive	secrecy	that	 surrounds	 their	 political	 structures,	 their	 leadership
and	the	decision-making	process	within	 the	movement.	The	Taliban	do	not	issue
press	releases,	policy	statements	or	 hold	 regular	press	conferences.	With	  their
ban	on	photography	and	television,	 nobody	knows	 what	their	 leaders	even	look
like.	  The	 one-eyed	  Taliban	  leader	 Mullah	  Mohammed	  Omar	  remains	 an
enigmatic	mystery.	 After	  the	Khmer	 Rouge	 in	 Cambodia,	the	 Taliban	 are	the
most	secretive	political	movement	in	 the	world	today.
       Yet	 the	Taliban	 have	inadvertently	set	a	new	agenda	for	 Islamic	radicalism
in	the	entire	region,	sending	shock	waves	through	Afghanistan's	 neighbours.	Not
surprisingly,	 Iran,	  Turkey,	 India,	 Russia	 and	 four	 of	  the	five	  Central	 Asian

27
Republics	–	Uzbekistan,	 Kazakhstan,	Kyrgyzstan	 and	Tajikistan	 –	have	 backed
the	anti-Taliban	  Northern	 Alliance	  with	 arms	 and	money	 to	 try	 and	 halt	 the
Taliban's	 advance.	 In	 contrast	 Pakistan	 and	 Saudi	 Arabia	  have	 backed	 the
Taliban.	In	 the	 post-Cold	War	 era,	this	 has	created	unprecedented	polarization
across	the	region.	The	Taliban	 victories	 in	northern	 Afghanistan	 in	the	summer
of	1998	 and	their	 control	 of	 over	90	 per	cent	of	 the	 country,	set	in	 motion	 an
even	fiercer	  regional	 conflict	  as	 Iran	 threatened	 to	 invade	 Afghanistan	  and
accused	Pakistan	of	supporting	the	Taliban.
       At	 the	 heart	of	 this	regional	 stand-off	is	 the	battle	 for	the	 vast	oil	 and	gas
riches	of	 landlocked	Central	 Asia	–	 the	last	untapped	reserves	of	 energy	in	 the
world	 today.	 Equally	 important	 has	been	the	 intense	competition	 between	 the
regional	states	and	Western	oil	 companies	as	to	 who	 would	 build	 the	lucrative
pipelines	which	  are	needed	to	 transport	the	 energy	to	 markets	 in	 Europe	and
Asia.	This	 rivalry	 has	in	effect	 become	a	new	Great	Game	–	a	throwback	to	 the
nineteenth	century	 Great	 Game	between	 Russia	and	 Britain	 over	 control	 and
domination	in	Central	Asia	 and	Afghanistan.
       Since	 late	1995,	Washington	 had	strongly	backed	the	US	 company	Unocal
to	build	 a	gas	pipeline	from	 Turkmenistan	to	 Pakistan	across	Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan.	But	 there	was	another,	unexpected	player	in	this	 new	Great	Game.
The	day	 after	 the	 execution	 I	 arrived	 at	 the	mansion	 of	 Mullah	  Mohammed
Hassan,	the	Governor	of	 Kandahar,	to	interview	 him.	 As	 I	walked	 up	the	 drive
past	the	heavily	 armed	Taliban	 guards,	 I	froze.	 Coming	 out	 of	 the	Governor's
office	  was	  a	  handsome,	 silver-haired	   business	 executive	  dressed	  in	  an
impeccable	blue	blazer	 with	 gold	 buttons,	a	yellow	  silk	 tie	 and	Italian	 loafers.
With	him	 were	two	other	 businessmen,	both	as	impeccably	dressed	and	carrying
bulging	 briefcases.	They	 looked	 as	though	 they	had	 just	concluded	 a	 deal	on
Wall	Street,	rather	than	holding	 negotiations	with	 a	band	of	Islamic	 guerrillas	 in
the	dusty	lanes	of	Kandahar.
       The	 executive	was	Carlos	Bulgheroni,	 Chairman	 of	Bridas	 Corporation,	an
Argentinean	oil	 company	 which	 since	1994	had	 been	secretly	negotiating	 with
the	Taliban	 and	 the	 Northern	 Alliance	 to	 build	  the	same	 gas	pipeline	 across
Afghanistan.	Bridas	 were	in	 bitter	 competition	 with	 Unocal	and	in	 a	court	 case
filed	in	California,	 they	had	even	accused	Unocal	of	stealing	the	idea	from	them.
       For	 a	 year	 I	 had	 been	trying	  to	discover	 what	 interests	 an	 Argentinean
company,	unknown	in	 this	part	of	the	world,	 had	in	investing	 in	such	a	high-risk
place	as	Afghanistan.	 But	 both	Bridas	 and	Unocal	 had	kept	 a	discreet	silence.
The	last	thing	Bulgheroni	 wanted	was	to	be	seen	by	a	journalist	 coming	out	of	 a

28
Taliban	 leader's	office.	 He	 excused	himself	  and	said	 his	 company	plane	 was
waiting	to	fly	 him	 to	the	Northern	Alliance's	 capital	in	Mazar-e-Sharif.
       As	 the	battle	for	 pipelines	 from	Central	 Asia	intensified,	 the	Islamic	 world
and	the	 West	 were	also	 concerned	 whether	the	 Taliban	 represented	the	 new
future	    of	    Islamic	    fundamentalism	    –	    aggressive,	   expansionist	    and
uncompromising	 in	  its	 purist	  demands	 to	 turn	  Afghan	 society	  back	 to	 an
imagined	  model	  of	  seventh-century	  Arabia	  at	  the	  time	  of	   the	 Prophet
Mohammed.	The	 West	 also	feared	the	 repercussions	from	 the	ever-expanding
drugs	 trade	from	  Afghanistan	  and	 the	 Taliban's	 harbouring	  of	 international
terrorists	such	as	the	Saudi	extremist	 Osama	Bin	Laden,	 whose	group	Al'Qaida
carried	out	the	devastating	bombings	of	US	embassies	in	Kenya	and	Tanzania	in
August	1998.
       Moreover,	  experts	wondered	whether	 the	Taliban's	 back-to-basics	Islamic
ideals	fulfilled	  the	 dire	 predictions	 of	 some	American	 intellectuals	 that	 in	 the
post-Cold	War	 era,	 a	new	 militant	 Islamic	 world	  would	 oppose	the	West	 and
create	another	version	of	the	Cold	War	in	a	new	clash	of	civilisations.1
       For	 Afghanistan	to	 be	at	the	centre	of	such	conflict	 is	nothing	new.	Today's
Taliban	 are	only	 the	 latest	in	 a	 long	 line	 of	 conquerors,	 warlords,	 preachers,
saints	and	philosophers	who	have	swept	through	the	Afghan	 corridor	 destroying
older	 civilizations	  and	religions	  and	introducing	  new	 ones.	The	 kings	 of	 the
ancient	world	 believed	the	Afghanistan	 region	was	the	 very	centre	of	 the	world
and	 this	  view	  has	  persisted	 to	  modern	  times.	  The	 famous	  Indian	  poet
Mohammed	 Iqbal	 described	 Afghanistan	 as	 ‘the	 heart	 of	  Asia’,	 while	  Lord
Curzon,	the	early	 twentieth-century	 British	 Viceroy	 of	India	 called	 Afghanistan
‘the	cockpit	of	 Asia’.2
       For	 few	 countries	 in	 the	world	 is	 it	 more	true	 that	geography	 determines
history,	politics	 and	the	 nature	of	a	people.	 Afghanistan's	geo-strategic	location
on	the	crossroads	between	Iran,	the	Arabian	 Sea	and	India	and	between	Central
Asia	and	South	 Asia	has	given	 its	 territory	 and	mountain	 passes	a	significance
since	the	earliest	Aryan	invasions	 6,000	years	ago.	Afghanistan's	rough,	rugged,
deserted	and	arid	terrain	 has	produced	some	of	 the	best	fighters	 the	 world	 has
ever	seen,	while	its	stunning	 scenery	of	gaunt	mountains	and	lush	 green	valleys
with	fruit-laden	 trees	have	proved	to	be	an	inspiration	to	poets.
       Many	  years	ago	a	 wise	 old	 Afghan	 Mujahed	 once	told	  me	the	 mythical
story	of	 how	 God	 made	 Afghanistan.	 ‘When	 Allah	  had	made	 the	rest	 of	 the
world,	He	saw	that	there	was	a	lot	of	rubbish	 left	over,	bits	 and	pieces	and	things
that	did	 not	 fit	 anywhere	else.	He	 collected	 them	all	 together	 and	threw	 them

29
down	on	to	the	earth.	That	was	Afghanistan,’	the	old	man	said.
       Modern	  Afghanistan	 encompasses	245,000	square	miles.	  The	country	  is
split	 by	 a	north-south	 divide	 along	 the	massive	 Hindu	 Kush	 mountain	 range.
Although	 there	 was	 much	 intermingling	  of	 races	in	 the	 twentieth	 century,	 a
rough	division	 shows	 that	to	 the	south	of	 the	Hindu	 Kush	 live	 the	 majority	 of
Pashtuns	and	some	Persian-speaking	ethnic	groups,	to	the	north	live	the	Persian
and	Turkic	 ethnic	 groups.	The	 Hindu	 Kush	 itself	 is	 populated	by	 the	Persian-
speaking	Hazaras	and	Tajiks.	 In	the	 far	northeast	corner,	 the	Pamir	mountains,
which	 Marco	 Polo	 called	 ‘the	 roof	 of	 the	 world’,	  abut	Tajikistan,	  China	and
Pakistan.3	 The	  inaccessibility	   of	  the	  Pamirs	  means	  that	  there	  is	  little
communication	between	the	myriad	of	 diverse	and	exotic	ethnic	groups	who	live
in	its	high,	snow-bound	valleys.
       In	 the	southern	foothills	 of	the	Hindu	Kush	 lies	Kabul;	the	adjoining	 valleys
are	the	  most	 agriculturally	   productive	 region	  in	 the	  country.	 Western	 and
southern	Afghanistan	 marks	the	 eastern	end	of	 the	Iranian	 plateau	–	 flat,	 bare
and	arid	 with	 few	 towns	 and	a	sparse	population.	 Much	 of	 this	 region	 is	just
called	‘registan’	 or	 desert	by	local	 Afghans.	The	 exception	is	the	 oasis	town	of
Herat,	which	has	been	a	centre	of	civilization	for	 more	than	3,000	years.
       North	  of	 the	 Hindu	 Kush	 the	 bare	Central	 Asian	 steppe	begins	 its	 long
sweep,	which	stretches	thousands	of	miles	north	 into	 Siberia.	With	 its	extremes
of	climate	 and	terrain	the	north's	Turkic	 peoples	are	some	of	the	toughest	in	 the
world	 and	 make	 the	 fiercest	 of	  fighters.	 In	  eastern	Afghanistan	 lie	  smaller
mountain	ranges	including	  the	 Suleman	range	which	 straddle	 the	border	 with
Pakistan	and	are	populated	on	both	 sides	by	the	 Pashtun	tribes.	Passes	through
these	mountains	 such	 as	 the	famous	  Khyber	 Pass	have	 for	  centuries	 given
conquerors	access	to	the	fertile	Indian	plains.
       Only	 10-12	 per	cent	of	 Afghanistan's	 terrain	is	 cultivable	 and	most	farms,
some	hanging	from	mountain	slopes,	demand	extraordinary	amounts	of	labour	to
keep	them	productive.	 Until	 the	1970s	nomadism	 -the	grazing	 of	goats	and	the
fat-tailed	 Afghan	  sheep	–	 was	 a	 major	 source	 of	 livelihood	  and	 the	 Kochi
nomads	 travelled	  thousands	  of	  miles	  every	  year	  in	  Pakistan,	  Iran	  and
Afghanistan	 in	 search	of	 good	 pasture.	Although	  the	war	 against	the	 Soviets
destroyed	Kochi	culture	 and	livelihood	 in	the	 1980s,	animal	herding	is	still	 vital
in	 sustaining	 impoverished	 farmers.	 Yesterday's	 Afghan	  nomads	are	 today's
traders	and	truck-drivers,	 who	are	a	crucial	 support	base	and	revenue	generator
for	the	Taliban	by	running	 trucks	along	the	smuggling	routes	across	Afghanistan.
       Roads	and	routes	have	been	at	the	centre	of	Afghanistan	 since	the	dawn	of

30
history.	 The	landlocked	 territory	  was	the	 crossroads	of	 Asia	 and	the	 meeting
place	and	 battleground	 for	 two	 great	 waves	 of	 civilization,	  the	 more	 urbane
Persian	empires	to	 the	 west	 and	the	 Turkic	 nomadic	 empires	 to	 the	north	 in
Central	 Asia.	 As	  a	 result	 Afghanistan	  is	 immensely	  rich	 in	  archaeological
remains.
       For	 these	two	ancient	civilizations,	  which	 ebbed	in	greatness	and	conquest
according	to	 the	momentum	 of	 history,	 control	 over	Afghanistan	 was	vital	  for
their	survival.	 At	 other	times	 Afghanistan	 served	as	a	buffer	keeping	 these	two
empires	apart,	while	 at	 other	times	 it	 served	as	a	corridor	 through	 which	 their
armies	marched	north	to	south	or	west	to	east	when	they	desired	to	invade	India.
This	  was	  a	  land	   where	  the	  first	   ancient	  religions	   of	  Zoroastrianism,
Manichaeanism	and	 Buddhism	 flourished.	 Balkh,	  the	ruins	 of	 which	  are	still
visible	 a	few	 miles	 from	 Mazar-e-Sharif,	 is	according	 to	UNESCO	 one	 of	 the
oldest	cities	in	 the	world	  and	it	 was	a	thriving	 centre	 of	Buddhist,	 Persian	and
Turkic	arts	and	architecture.
       It	 was	 through	 Afghanistan	 that	pilgrims	  and	traders	working	  the	ancient
Silk	Route	carried	 Buddhism	to	China	 and	Japan.	Conquerors	swept	through	the
region	like	 shooting	 stars.	In	329	BC	 the	Macedonian	 Greeks	under	Alexander
the	Great	conquered	Afghanistan	and	Central	Asia	 and	went	on	to	 invade	India.
The	Greeks	left	behind	a	new,	 vibrant	Buddhist-Greek	 kingdom	 and	civilization
in	 the	 Hindu	  Kush	 mountains	 –	 the	 only	  known	  historical	 fusion	  between
European	and	Asian	cultures.
       By	  654	AD	  Arab	 armies	had	swept	 through	 Afghanistan	 to	 arrive	at	 the
Oxus	river	 on	the	border	 with	 Central	Asia.	 They	brought	 with	 them	their	 new
religion	of	 Islam,	which	 preached	equality	and	justice	and	quickly	 penetrated	the
entire	region.	Under	 the	Persian	Saminid	dynasty	which	 lasted	from	 874	to	 999
AD,	 Afghanistan	was	 part	of	 a	new	Persian	renaissance	in	arts	and	letters.	The
Ghaznavid	dynasty	ruled	from	977	to	 1186	and	captured	north	west	India	Punjab
and	parts	of	eastern	Iran.
       In	 1219	Genghis	 Khan	and	his	 Mongol	 hordes	swept	through	 Afghanistan
destroying	cities	such	as	Balkh	 and	Herat	and	piling	 up	mounds	of	 dead	bodies.
Yet	the	Mongols	 contributed	 too,	 by	leaving	 behind	the	modern	 day	Hazaras	–
who	were	the	result	of	inter-marriage	between	the	Mongols	and	local	tribes.
       In	 the	 next	 century	 Taimur,	 or	 Tamerlane	as	he	 is	called	 in	 the	 West,	a
descendent	of	Genghis	Khan,	created	a	vast	new	empire	across	Russia	and	Persia
which	 he	 ruled	  from	  his	 capital	 in	  Samarkand	 in	 modern-day	  Uzbekistan.
Taimur	captured	Herat	in	 1381	and	his	son	Shah	Rukh	 moved	the	capital	of	 the

31
Timurid	 empire	 to	 Herat	in	 1405.	 The	Timurids,	  a	Turkic	  people	brought	 the
Turkic	 nomadic	culture	 of	 Central	Asia	 within	 the	orbit	 of	 Persian	civilization,
establishing	in	 Herat	 one	of	 the	most	 cultured	and	 refined	 cities	in	 the	 world.
This	 fusion	 of	 Central	Asian	  and	Persian	culture	 was	 a	major	 legacy	 for	 the
future	 of	 Afghanistan.	  A	 century	  later	 the	 emperor	 Babur,	 a	 descendent	of
Taimur,	visited	 Herat	and	wrote,	‘the	whole	 habitable	world	 had	not	such	a	town
as	Herat’.4
       For	 the	next	300	years	the	eastern	Afghan	tribes	periodically	 invaded	India,
conquering	Delhi	  and	creating	 vast	 Indo-Afghan	 empires.	 The	 Afghan	 Lodhi
dynasty	ruled	Delhi	 from	1451	to	 1526.	In	1500	Taimur's	 descendent	Babur	was
driven	 out	of	 his	 home	 in	 the	Ferghana	valley	 in	 Uzbekistan.	 He	 went	 on	to
conquer	first	 Kabul	 in	1504	 and	then	Delhi.	 He	 established	the	Mogul	 dynasty
which	was	to	rule	 India	until	 the	arrival	 of	 the	British.	 At	the	same	time	 Persian
power	declined	 in	 the	west	 and	Herat	 was	conquered	 by	the	 Uzbek	 Shaybani
Khans.	By	 the	sixteenth	century	 western	Afghanistan	 again	reverted	 to	Persian
rule	under	the	Safavid	dynasty.
       This	 series	of	invasions	resulted	in	 a	complex	ethnic,	 cultural	 and	religious
mix	 that	 was	  to	 make	 Afghan	  nation-building	  extremely	  difficult.	  Western
Afghanistan	was	dominated	by	speakers	of	Persian	or	Dari	as	the	Afghan	Persian
dialect	is	 known.	 Dari	was	 also	spoken	by	 the	Hazaras	in	 central	Afghanistan,
who	were	 converted	 to	 Shiism	 by	the	 Persians,	thereby	 becoming	the	 largest
Shia	group	in	an	otherwise	 Sunni	territory.	 In	the	 west	the	Tajiks,	the	 repositors
of	Persia's	ancient	culture	also	spoke	Dari.	 In	 northern	Afghanistan	 the	Uzbeks,
Turcomans,	Kyrgyz	 and	others	spoke	the	Turkic	languages	of	Central	Asia.	 And
in	the	south	and	east	the	Pashtun	tribes	spoke	their	own	tongue	Pashto,	a	mixture
of	Indo-Persian	languages.
       It	  was	 the	 southern	 Pashtuns	 who	 were	 to	  form	  the	 modern	 state	 of
Afghanistan	 at	the	historical	  conjuncture	when	 the	Persian	 Safavid	dynasty	 in
the	west,	the	Moguls	in	India	and	the	Uzbek	Janid	dynasty	were	all	in	 a	period	of
decline	 in	 the	eighteenth	 century.	 The	 Pashtun	tribes	 were	 divided	  into	 two
major	 sections,	the	 Ghilzai	 and	 Abdali	  who	 later	 called	 themselves	Durrani,
which	frequently	 competed	against	each	other.
       The	 Pashtuns	trace	their	 genealogy	 to	 Qais,	a	 companion	of	 the	 Prophet
Mohammed.	  As	  such	 they	  consider	  themselves	 a	 Semitic	  race	  although
anthropologists	 consider	 them	 to	  be	 Indo-Europeans,	 who	 have	 assimilated
numerous	ethnic	groups	over	 the	course	of	history.	 The	Durranis	 claim	 descent
from	Qais's	eldest	son	Sarbanar	while	the	Ghilzais	claim	descent	from	his	second

32
son.	Qais's	third	 son	is	 said	to	 be	the	 ancestor	of	 other	diverse	 Pashtun	tribes
such	as	the	 Kakars	 in	 Kandahar	and	 the	Safis	 around	Peshawar.	In	 the	 sixth
century	Chinese	and	Indian	sources	speak	of	the	Afghans/Pashtuns	living	east	of
Ghazni.	These	tribes	began	a	westward	migration	to	 Kandahar,	Kabul	and	Herat
from	the	 fifteenth	 century.	By	 the	next	 century	the	 Ghilzais	and	 Durranis	were
already	fighting	  each	 other	 over	 land	 disputes	 around	 Kandahar.	 Today	 the
Ghilzai	 homeland	 lies	 south	 of	 the	 Kabul	 river	 between	 the	 Safed	Koh	  and
Suleman	range	on	the	east	to	Hazarajat	in	the	west	and	down	to	Kandahar	in	the
south.5
       In	  1709,	Mir	  Wais,	 the	 chief	 of	 the	Hotaki	  tribe	 of	 Ghilzai	 Pashtuns	in
Kandahar	rebelled	 against	 the	Safavid	  Shah.	This	 was	 partly	 a	 result	 of	 the
Shah's	attempts	to	convert	the	fervently	 Sunni	Pashtuns	into	Shias	–	a	historical
animosity	 that	was	 to	re-emerge	 with	 the	 Taliban's	hostility	  towards	 Iran	 and
Afghan	Shias	three	centuries	later.
       A	 few	 years	later	Mir	 Wais's	son	defeated	the	Safavids	and	conquered	Iran.
But	the	Afghans	 were	driven	out	 of	Iran	in	 1729.	As	 Ghilzai	power	 ebbed,	their
traditional	 rivals	in	 Kandahar,	the	Abdalis,	 formed	 a	confederation	and	in	 1747
after	a	nine-day	Loya	 Jirga	or	 meeting	of	 tribal	chiefs,	 they	chose	Ahmad	Shah
Abdali	 as	their	 king.	 The	 tribal	 chiefs	 wrapped	a	 turban	around	 his	 head	and
placed	blades	of	grass	in	it,	signifying	 loyalty.	The	Loya	 Jirga	was	to	become	the
traditional	  legal	 instrument	  which	  legitimized	   new	 rulers	  thus	 avoiding	  a
hereditary	monarchy.	 The	rulers	themselves	could	 claim	 that	they	 were	elected
by	the	 tribes	 represented	in	 the	Jirga.	 Ahmad	 Shah	changed	the	 name	of	 the
Abdali	confederation	 to	Durrani,	 united	all	 the	Pashtun	tribes	and	began	a	series
of	major	conquests,	quickly	taking	 control	over	much	of	 modern	day	Pakistan.
       By	  1761	 Ahmad	  Shah	Durrani	  had	 defeated	the	 Hindu	  Mahrattas	 and
captured	the	Delhi	throne	and	Kashmir,	thereby	creating	the	first	 Afghan	empire.
Considered	the	father	of	the	Afghan	 nation,	 Ahmad	Shah	Durrani	 was	buried	in
an	ornate	mausoleum	in	his	capital	Kandahar,	where	Afghans	 still	 come	to	pray.
Many	Afghans	 have	conferred	a	kind	of	sainthood	on	him.	 His	son	Taimur	 Shah
moved	the	 empire's	new	 capital	 from	  Kandahar	to	 Kabul	 in	 1772,	 making	 it
easier	to	 control	  the	 newly	  conquered	 territories	 north	  of	 the	 Hindu	  Kush
mountains	and	east	of	 the	 river	 Indus.	By	 1780	 the	Durranis	 had	concluded	 a
treaty	 with	  the	 Amir	  of	 Bukhara,	  the	 principal	  Central	 Asian	 ruler,	  which
designated	the	Oxus	or	Amu	Darya	river	 as	the	border	between	Central	Asia	and
the	new	 Pashtun	state	of	 Afghanistan.	 It	 was	 the	first	  border	delineation	 that
marked	the	northern	boundary	of	the	new	Afghanistan.

33
       In	 the	 next	 century	the	 Durranis	 were	 to	lose	 their	 territories	 east	of	 the
Indus	river	 while	  feuds	between	various	 Durrani	 clans	dissipated	 their	 power.
However,	 one	or	 another	 Durrani	 clan	 was	to	 rule	 Afghanistan	 for	  over	200
years	until	1973,	when	 King	Zahir	 Shah	was	deposed	by	his	cousin	Mohammed
Daud	Khan	  and	Afghanistan	  was	declared	 a	 Republic.	 Meanwhile	 the	 bitter
rivalry	  between	the	 Ghilzai	  and	 the	 Durrani	  Pashtuns	was	 to	 continue	 and
intensify	  in	 the	  aftermath	 of	  the	 Soviet	  invasion	  of	  Afghanistan	  and	 the
subsequent	emergence	of	the	Taliban.
       The	  weakened	and	 bickering	  Durrani	  kings	  had	 to	 hold	 off	  two	  new
empires,	the	British	 in	 the	east	and	the	Russians	to	the	 north.	In	 the	nineteenth
century,	fearful	  of	 an	 ever	expanding	 Russian	empire	 in	 Central	 Asia	 which
might	covet	 Afghanistan	for	 a	thrust	against	Britain's	 Indian	 empire,	the	 British
made	three	attempts	to	conquer	and	hold	Afghanistan	until	 they	realised	that	the
intractable	Afghans	 could	be	bought	much	 more	easily	than	fought.	 The	British
offered	 cash	 subsidies,	 manipulated	 the	 tribal	  chiefs	  and	 managed	 to	 turn
Afghanistan	into	 a	 client	 state.	What	followed	  was	‘the	 Great	 Game’	between
Russia	and	Britain,	a	clandestine	war	of	wits	 and	bribery	and	occasional	military
pressure	as	both	powers	kept	each	other	at	a	respectful	 distance	by	maintaining
Afghanistan	as	a	buffer	state	between	them.
       The	  feuds	 amongst	the	 ruling	  Durranis	  which	  were	 fuelled	 by	  British
intelligence	officers	 ensured	that	Afghan	kings	remained	weak	and	dependent	on
British	  largesse	 to	  make	 up	  for	  their	  inability	   to	  raise	  revenues.	 As	  a
consequence	the	non-Pashtun	groups	in	the	north	exercised	increasing	autonomy
from	central	 control	in	 Kabul.	 The	Pashtuns	were	also	weakened	by	the	 British
conquest	of	north-west	India,	 which	 for	the	first	 time	 divided	 the	Pashtun	tribes
between	British	  India	  and	 Afghanistan.	  This	 partition	  of	 the	 Pashtuns	 was
formalised	by	the	Durand	Line,	 a	formal	border	drawn	up	by	Britain	 in	1893.
       After	  the	 second	Anglo-Afghan	   war,	 the	 British	 supported	 Amir	  Abdul
Rehman's	claim	to	 the	throne.	 The	‘Iron	 Amir’	  (1880-1901),	 as	he	was	 called,
received	British	 support	to	centralize	and	strengthen	the	Afghan	state.	The	Amir
used	British	subsidies	and	arms	supplies	to	create	an	effective	administration	and
a	standing	army.	He	subdued	rebellious	 Pashtun	tribes	and	then	moved	north	 to
ruthlessly	 end	the	 autonomy	of	 the	 Hazaras	and	 Uzbeks.	Using	 methods	 that
were	to	 be	 closely	 followed	 a	 century	 later	 by	 the	Taliban,	  he	carried	 out	 a
nineteenth-century	  version	   of	   ethnic	  cleansing,	  massacring	   non-Pashtun
opponents	and	transporting	Pashtuns	to	settle	farms	in	the	north	thereby	creating
a	loyal	Pashtun	population	amongst	the	other	ethnic	minorities.

34
       Abdul	  Rehman	 crushed	over	 40	 revolts	 by	 the	 non-Pashtuns	during	 his
reign	and	created	Afghanistan's	first	brutal	 secret	police	force,	a	precursor	to	the
communist	Khad	 in	the	1980s.	Although	  these	moves	integrated	Afghans	of	 all
ethnic	 groups	and	 solidified	  the	 Afghan	  state	as	never	 before,	 much	 of	  the
subsequent	 ethnic	  tensions	 in	   northern	  Afghanistan	  and	  the	  inter-ethnic
massacres	after	1997	can	be	traced	back	 to	the	 Iron	 Amir's	 policies.	 His	 other
legacies,	which	were	to	indirectly	 influence	the	Taliban,	 included	the	isolation	 of
Afghanistan	 from	 Western	or	 modernizing	 influences	 including	 education,	 his
emphasis	on	  Islam	 by	  enhancing	 the	 powers	 of	  the	 Pashtun	 mullahs	  and
introducing	 the	 concept	 of	 a	 divine	  right	 to	  rule	 rather	 than	 the	 traditional
concept	of	election	by	the	Loya	Jirga.
       The	 successors	of	the	Iron	 Amir	 in	 the	early	 part	of	 the	twentieth	 century
were	by	and	large	 modernizers,	who	established	full	 formal	 independence	from
Britain	in	 1919,	established	the	country's	first	 constitution	and	set	about	creating
a	small	urban	educated	elite.	 Nevertheless	the	fact	that	 two	 Afghan	kings	 were
assassinated	and	 that	  there	 were	  periodic	  tribal	  revolts	  demonstrated	 the
difficulties	  rulers	 faced	in	  turning	 a	multiethnic	  tribal	  society	 into	 a	modern
state.
       The	end	of	 the	Durrani	dynasty	came	when	King	 Zahir	Shah,	who	had	ruled
since	1933	 was	deposed	by	 his	 cousin	and	 brother-in-law	 Sardar	 Mohammed
Daud	who	  sent	Zahir	 Shah	 into	 exile	 in	 Rome.	 Afghanistan	  was	declared	 a
Republic	and	Daud	ruled	as	president.	Daud	was	helped	by	 leftist	officers	 in	 the
army	and	the	small,	urban-based	Parcham	party	led	by	 Babrak	Karmal,	 to	crush
a	nascent	Islamic	fundamentalist	 movement.	The	leaders	of	 this	movement	fled
to	Peshawar	in	1975	and	were	backed	by	Pakistan's	Prime	Minister	 Zulfiqar	  Ali
Bhutto	  to	  continue	  their	  opposition	  to	  Daud.	  These	  leaders,	 Gulbuddin
Hikmetyar,	Burhanuddin	 Rabbani	and	Ahmad	Shah	Masud	were	later	to	lead	the
Mujaheddin.
       Daud	 turned	 to	 the	Soviet	 Union	  for	 aid	 to	 try	 and	modernize	 the	 state
structure.	From	1956	 to	78	the	 Soviet	Union	 gave	a	total	 of	US$1.26	 billion	 in
economic	aid	and	US$1.25	billion	  in	military	  aid	to	 Afghanistan,	as	the	Soviets
welded	the	country	 into	their	 sphere	of	influence	 at	the	height	of	 the	Cold	 War.
During	 the	same	period,	the	US	 gave	Afghanistan	 US$533	million	  in	 total	aid,
much	of	it	 in	 the	1950s	after	which	 Washington	lost	 interest.	By	 the	time	Daud
seized	power	Afghanistan	 had	become	a	 rentier	state	with	 40	 per	cent	 of	state
revenues	coming	from	 abroad.	 Yet	 Daud,	like	 his	 royal	 predecessors	failed	to
build	 institutions.	 Instead,	a	loose	 centrally	 administered	bureaucracy	 was	laid

35
over	 the	existing	  society	 with	 little	  public	  representation	except	 in	 the	 now
largely	nominated	Loya	Jirga.6
       Just	five	 years	later	 in	April	  1978,	Marxist	 sympathizers	in	 the	army,	 who
had	been	trained	in	 the	 Soviet	Union	 and	 some	of	 whom	 had	helped	Daud	 to
power	in	 1973,	overthrew	 him	in	 a	bloody	 military	 coup.	 Daud,	his	 family	 and
the	 Presidential	 Bodyguard	  were	 all	  massacred.	But	  the	 communists	  were
bitterly	divided	 into	two	 factions,	Khalq	 (the	masses)	and	Parcham	(the	flag)	and
their	 lack	  of	 understanding	 of	  Afghanistan's	  complex	 tribal	  society	  led	 to
widespread	rural	revolts	 against	them.	 As	mullahs	 and	khans	declared	 jihad	or
holy	 war	  against	 the	 infidel	  communists,	  the	 communist	 ruling	  elite	  were
themselves	 trapped	  in	  internecine	  violence.	  The	  first	   Khalqi	  communist
President	Nur	Mohammed	Taraki	 was	murdered,	while	 his	successor	Hafizullah
Amin	was	killed	 when	Soviet	troops	invaded	Afghanistan	 in	December	1979	and
installed	the	Parcham	leader	Babrak	Karmal,	as	President.
       Within	  a	few	 short,	dramatic	months	Afghanistan	 had	been	catapulted	into
the	centre	of	the	 intensified	 Cold	War	 between	the	Soviet	 Union	 and	the	USA.
The	 Afghan	 Mujaheddin	  were	 to	 become	 the	 US-backed,	 anti-Soviet	 shock
troops.	But	  for	 the	 Afghans	 the	Soviet	 invasion	  was	yet	 another	 attempt	 by
outsiders	to	subdue	them	 and	replace	 their	time-honoured	 religion	 and	 society
with	an	alien	ideology	 and	social	system.	The	jihad	took	on	a	new	momentum	 as
the	USA,	  China	 and	Arab	 states	 poured	in	 money	 and	 arms	 supplies	to	 the
Mujaheddin.	 Out	of	 this	 conflict,	 which	 was	to	 claim	 1.5	million	  Afghan	 lives
and	only	 end	when	 Soviet	 troops	withdrew	  from	 Afghanistan	 in	 1989,	 would
emerge	a	second	generation	of	 Mujaheddin	 who	 called	themselves	Taliban	 (or
the	students	of	Islam.)

                                      KANDAHAR	           1994:
                                          THE	    ORIGINS
                                     OF	   THE	    TALIBAN

	



The	Taliban	Governor	of	Kandahar,	Mullah	Mohammed	Hassan	Rehmani,	has	a
disconcerting	habit	of	pushing	the	table	in	front	of	him	with	his	one	good	leg.	By
the	time	any	conversation	with	him	is	over,	the	wooden	table	has	been	pushed
round	and	round	his	chair	a	dozen	times.	Hassan's	nervous	twitch	is	perhaps	a
psychological	need	to	feel	that	he	still	has	a	leg	or	perhaps	he	is	just	exercizing,
keeping	his	one	good	leg	on	the	move	at	all	times.
       Hassan's	second	limb	is	a	wooden	peg-leg,	in	the	style	of	Long	John	Silver,
the	pirate	in	 Robert	Louis	 Stevenson's	Treasure	Island.	It's	an	old	 wooden
stump.	The	varnish	rubbed	off	long	ago,	scratches	cover	its	length	and	bits	of
wood	have	been	gouged	out	–	no	doubt	by	the	difficulties	of	 negotiating	the
rocky	terrain	outside	his	office.	Hassan,	one	of	the	oldest	Taliban	leaders	at	over
40	and	one	of	the	few	who	actually	fought	Soviet	troops,	was	a	founder	member
of	the	Taliban	and	is	considered	to	be	number	two	in	the	movement	to	his	old
friend	Mullah	Omar.
       Hassan	lost	his	leg	in	1989	on	the	Kandahar	front,	just	before	Soviet	troops
began	their	 withdrawal	from	  Afghanistan.	Despite	the	 availability	 of	  new
artificial	 limbs	 now	 being	fitted	  to	 the	country's	millions	  of	 amputees	by
international	aid	agencies,	Hassan	says	he	prefers	his	peg-leg.	He	also	lost	a
finger	 tip,	 the	 result	 of	 another	wound	 caused	by	 shrapnel.	The	 Taliban
leadership	can	boast	to	be	the	most	disabled	in	the	world	today	and	visitors	do
not	know	how	to	react,	whether	to	laugh	or	to	cry.	Mullah	Omar	lost	his	right
eye	in	1989	when	a	rocket	exploded	close	by.	The	Justice	Minister	Nuruddin
Turabi	and	the	former	Foreign	Minister	Mohammed	Ghaus	are	also	one-eyed.
The	Mayor	of	Kabul,	Abdul	Majid,	has	one	leg	and	two	fingers	missing.	Other
leaders,	even	military	commanders,	have	similar	disabilities.
       The	Taliban's	wounds	are	a	constant	reminder	of	20	years	of	war,	which	has
killed	over	 1.5	million	 people	and	devastated	the	country.	The	Soviet	Union

40
poured	some	US$5	billion	 a	year	into	 Afghanistan	to	 subdue	the	Mujaheddin	or
a	total	of	 US$45	 billion	 –	 and	they	 lost.	The	 US	committed	 some	four	 to	 five
billion	 dollars	between	1980	and	1992	in	 aid	to	the	 Mujaheddin.	US	 funds	were
matched	by	 Saudi	Arabia	 and	together	 with	 support	 from	 other	European	and
Islamic	countries,	the	Mujaheddin	 received	a	total	 of	over	 US$10	billion.1	 Most
of	 this	 aid	 was	 in	  the	 form	 of	  lethal	 modern	 weaponry	 given	  to	 a	 simple
agricultural	people	who	used	it	with	 devastating	results.
       The	 war	 wounds	of	 the	Taliban	 leaders	also	reflect	 the	 bloody	 and	brutal
style	of	 war	that	took	 place	in	 and	around	Kandahar	in	 the	1980s.	The	 Durrani
Pashtuns	who	inhabit	 the	south	and	Kandahar	received	 far	less	aid	 through	the
CIA	and	Western	aid	pipeline	 which	armed,	financed	and	provided	logistics	 such
as	medical	facilities	 to	the	 Mujaheddin,	 as	compared	to	the	Ghilzai	 Pashtuns	in
the	east	of	the	country	 and	around	Kabul.	 The	aid	was	distributed	 by	Pakistan's
Interservices	Intelligence	(ISI),	 who	tended	to	treat	Kandahar	as	a	backwater	and
the	Durranis	with	suspicion.	As	 a	consequence	the	nearest	medical	facilities	for	a
wounded	Kandahari	  Mujaheddin	 was	 a	 bone-shaking	 two-day	 camel	 ride	 to
Quetta	across	the	border	in	Pakistan.	Even	today	first-aid	amongst	the	Taliban	 is
rare,	doctors	are	all	too	few	and	surgeons	on	the	front	line	non-existent.	Virtually
the	only	medical	practitioners	 in	the	country	are	the	hospitals	of	the	International
Committee	of	the	Red	Cross	(ICRC).
       By	  chance	I	 was	 in	 Kandahar	 in	 December	1979	 and	 watched	 the	first
Soviet	tanks	roll	  in.	Teenage	Soviet	 soldiers	had	driven	 for	 two	 days	from	 the
Soviet	 Republic	 of	  Turkmenistan	 in	  Central	 Asia	 to	  Herat	 and	 then	 on	 to
Kandahar	along	a	metalled	highway	 that	the	Soviets	had	themselves	built	 in	 the
1960s.	Many	of	 the	soldiers	were	of	 Central	Asian	 origin.	 They	got	 out	of	 their
tanks,	dusted	off	their	 uniforms	 and	ambled	across	to	the	nearest	stall	for	 a	cup
of	sugarless	green	tea	–	a	staple	part	of	the	diet	in	both	 Afghanistan	and	Central
Asia.	The	Afghans	 in	 the	bazaar	just	stood	and	stared.	On	27	 December	Soviet
Spetsnatz	or	 Special	 Forces	had	 stormed	 the	 palace	of	  President	Hafizullah
Amin	 in	 Kabul,	 killed	  him,	 occupied	Kabul	 and	 appointed	Babrak	 Karmal	 as
President.
       When	 the	 resistance	began	 around	 Kandahar	it	  was	based	on	 the	 tribal
network	 of	 the	Durranis.	 In	  Kandahar	the	 struggle	 against	the	 Soviets	was	 a
tribal	jihad	 led	by	clan	chiefs	 and	ulema(senior	religious	scholars)	rather	than	an
ideological	 jihad	led	 by	 Islamicists.	In	 Peshawar	there	were	seven	Mujaheddin
parties	which	were	 recognised	by	Pakistan	and	received	a	share	of	aid	 from	 the
CIA	  pipeline.	 Significantly	   none	 of	 the	 seven	 parties	 were	 led	 by	 Durrani

41
Pashtuns.	In	Kandahar	all	 seven	parties	 had	a	following,	  but	 the	most	popular
parties	in	the	south	were	those	based	on	tribal	ties	such	as	the	Harakat-e-Inquilab
Islami	 (Movement	 of	the	 Islamic	 Revolution)	 led	 by	Maulvi	  Mohammed	 Nabi
Mohammedi	and	 another	Hizb-e-Islami	 (Party	 of	 Islam)	 led	by	 Maulvi	 Younis
Khalis.	Before	 the	war	both	leaders	were	well	known	 in	the	Pashtun	belt	and	ran
their	own	madrassas	or	religious	schools.
       For	 commanders	in	 the	 south	party	 loyalty	 depended	on	which	  Peshawar
leader	would	 provide	 money	 and	arms.	 Mullah	 Omar	 joined	 Khalis's	 Hizb-e-
Islami	 while	 Mullah	 Hassan	joined	 Harakat.	‘I	 knew	 Omar	extremely	 well	 but
we	were	fighting	  on	different	 fronts	 and	in	 different	 groups	 but	sometimes	we
fought	together,’	 said	Hassan.2	Also	popular	was	the	National	 Islamic	 Front	led
by	Pir	 Sayed	Ahmad	Gailani,	 who	advocated	the	return	 of	 the	Durrani	 ex-King
Zahir	Shah	to	lead	the	Afghan	 resistance	–	a	move	that	was	strongly	opposed	by
Pakistan	and	the	USA.	 The	ex-King	 was	 living	 in	 Rome	and	continued	to	 be	a
popular	figure	amongst	the	Kandaharis,	who	hoped	that	his	return	would	 reassert
the	leadership	role	of	the	Durrani	tribes.
       The	  contradictions	  within	  the	 Pashtun	 Mujaheddin	  leadership	 were	 to
weaken	the	 Pashtuns	as	the	 war	 progressed.	The	ulema	 valued	 the	 historical
ideals	of	 early	 Islamic	 history	 and	 rarely	 challenged	traditional	  Afghan	 tribal
structures	like	the	Jirga.	They	were	also	much	more	 accommodating	towards	the
ethnic	minorities.	 The	 Islamicists	 denigrated	the	 tribal	 structure	and	 pursued	a
radical	 political	  ideology	  in	  order	 to	 bring	  about	 an	 Islamic	  revolution	  in
Afghanistan.	 They	 were	exclusivists	 which	 made	 the	minorities	  suspicious	of
them.
       Thus	 Harakat	had	no	coherent	party	 structure	and	was	just	a	loose	alliance
between	commanders	and	tribal	 chiefs,	 many	of	 whom	 had	just	 a	rudimentary
madrassa	education.	On	 the	 other	hand	 Gulbuddin	 Hikmetyar's	 Hizb-e-Islami
built	 a	secretive,	 highly	 centralized,	 political	  organization	 whose	 cadres	were
drawn	from	 educated	urban	Pashtuns.	Prior	to	the	war	the	Islamicists	barely	had
a	base	in	Afghan	 society,	but	 with	 money	and	arms	from	 the	CIA	  pipeline	and
support	 from	  Pakistan,	 they	 built	  one	 and	 wielded	  tremendous	 clout.	  The
traditionalists	and	the	 Islamicists	fought	 each	other	mercilessly	so	that	 by	1994,
the	traditional	 leadership	in	Kandahar	had	virtually	  been	eliminated,	leaving	 the
field	free	for	 the	new	wave	of	even	more	extreme	Islamicists	–	the	Taliban.
       The	 battle	for	 Kandahar	was	also	determined	by	 its	own	 particular	history.
Kandahar	is	Afghanistan's	second	largest	city	with	 a	1979	pre-war	population	 of
about	250,000	and	twice	 that	 today.	The	old	 city	 has	been	inhabited	 since	500

42
BC,	but	just	 35	miles	away	 lies	Mundigak,	 a	Bronze-Age	 village	 settled	around
3,000	BC,	which	was	once	part	of	the	Indus	Valley	 civilization.	  Kandaharis	have
always	been	great	traders	as	the	 city	 was	located	at	 the	intersection	 of	 ancient
trade	routes	–	 eastwards	across	the	 Bolan	 Pass	to	Sind,	 the	 Arabian	 Sea	and
India	and	westwards	to	Herat	and	Iran.	 The	city	 was	the	main	crossing	point	 for
trade,	arts	and	 crafts	 between	Iran	 and	India	 and	 the	city's	 numerous	 bazaars
have	been	famous	for	centuries.
       The	 new	city	 has	changed	little	 from	 that	 laid	 out	in	 grand	proportions	 in
1761	by	Ahmad	Shah	Durrani,	 the	founder	of	 the	Durrani	 dynasty.	The	fact	that
the	Durranis	from	 Kandahar	were	 to	create	the	Afghan	 state	and	rule	it	 for	 300
years	 gave	 the	  Kandaharis	 a	  special	 status	 amongst	  the	 Pashtuns.	 As	  a
concession	to	 their	 home	 base,	Kabul's	 kings	 absolved	 the	 Kandaharis	 from
providing	 manpower	 for	  the	army.	 Ahmad	  Shah's	mausoleum	dominates	 the
central	bazaar	and	thousands	of	 Afghans	 still	 come	here	to	 pray	and	 pay	their
respects	to	the	founder	of	the	nation.
       Next	 to	his	tomb	is	the	shrine	of	 the	Cloak	of	the	Prophet	Mohammed	–	one
of	the	holiest	places	of	 worship	in	 Afghanistan.	The	Cloak	 has	been	shown	only
on	rare	occasions	such	as	when	King	Amanullah	 tried	to	 rally	 the	tribes	in	1929
and	when	 a	cholera	 epidemic	 hit	 the	 city	 in	  1935.3	But	 in	 1996	 in	 order	 to
legitimise	his	role	 as	leader	and	one	ordained	by	God	to	lead	the	Afghan	people,
Mullah	 Omar	took	out	 the	cloak	and	showed	it	 to	a	large	crowd	 of	Taliban	 who
then	named	him	Amirul	 Momineen	or	Leader	of	the	Faithful.
       However,	  Kandahar's	fame	 across	the	 region	 rests	on	 its	 fruit	  orchards.
Kandahar	is	an	oasis	town	 set	in	the	desert	and	the	summer	heat	is	devastating,
but	around	the	city	 are	lush,	 green	fields	and	shady	orchards	 producing	grapes,
melons,	 mulberries,	  figs,	  peaches	 and	  pomegranates	 which	  were	  famous
throughout	  India	   and	  Iran.	   Kandahar's	  pomegranates	 decorated	  Persian
manuscripts	written	 one	thousand	years	ago	and	were	served	at	the	table	 of	the
British	 Governor	 General	of	 India	 in	 Delhi	 during	 the	 last	century.	 The	 city's
truck	transporters,	 who	were	 to	 give	major	 financial	 support	 to	 the	Taliban	 in
their	drive	to	conquer	the	country,	 began	their	trade	in	the	last	century	when	they
carried	Kandahar's	fruit	as	far	as	Delhi	and	Calcutta.
       The	 orchards	 were	watered	 by	 a	complex	 and	 well-maintained	 irrigation
system	until	  the	war,	 when	 both	 the	 Soviets	and	 the	 Mujaheddin	 so	 heavily
mined	the	fields	 that	the	rural	population	 fled	 to	Pakistan	and	the	orchards	were
abandoned.	Kandahar	remains	one	of	the	most	heavily	mined	cities	in	 the	world.
In	an	otherwise	 flat	 landscape,	the	orchards	and	water	channels	provided	 cover

43
for	 the	Mujaheddin	 who	 quickly	  took	control	 of	 the	 countryside,	isolating	  the
Soviet	garrison	in	 the	city.	 The	Soviets	retaliated	 by	cutting	 down	thousands	of
trees	and	smashing	the	irrigation	  system.	When	 the	refugees	were	 to	return	 to
their	 devastated	orchards	after	 1990,	they	 were	 to	 grow	 opium	 poppies	for	 a
livelihood,	 creating	a	major	source	of	income	for	the	Taliban.
       With	  the	Soviet	withdrawal	 in	 1989	there	followed	  a	long	struggle	 against
the	regime	 of	 President	Najibullah	  until	  he	was	 overthrown	 in	 1992	 and	 the
Mujaheddin	captured	Kabul.	 Much	of	 Afghanistan's	subsequent	civil	 war	was	to
be	determined	by	 the	fact	 that	Kabul	 fell,	 not	 to	the	 well-armed	 and	bickering
Pashtun	parties	based	in	Peshawar,	but	to	the	better	 organized	and	more	united
Tajik	 forces	of	Burhanuddin	 Rabbani	and	his	military	  commander	Ahmad	Shah
Masud	and	to	the	Uzbek	forces	from	 the	north	under	General	Rashid	Dostum.	 It
was	a	devastating	psychological	blow	 because	for	the	first	time	 in	300	 years	the
Pashtuns	had	lost	 control	  of	 the	 capital.	 An	 internal	 civil	  war	 began	 almost
immediately	 as	 Hikmetyar	 attempted	 to	 rally	  the	Pashtuns	and	 laid	 siege	 to
Kabul,	shelling	it	 mercilessly.
       Afghanistan	 was	in	 a	state	of	 virtual	 disintegration	 just	before	 the	Taliban
emerged	at	the	end	of	1994.	The	country	was	divided	 into	 warlord	fiefdoms	 and
all	the	 warlords	 had	fought,	 switched	 sides	and	fought	 again	 in	a	 bewildering
array	  of	   alliances,	  betrayals	  and	   bloodshed.	  The	  predominantly	   Tajik
government	of	 President	 Burhanuddin	 Rabbani	controlled	  Kabul,	 its	 environs
and	the	north-east	of	the	 country,	while	 three	provinces	 in	the	west	 centring	on
Herat	were	controlled	 by	 Ismael	Khan.	 In	the	east	on	the	 Pakistan	border	three
Pashtun	provinces	 were	under	 the	 independent	control	 of	 a	 council	 or	 Shura
(Council)	 of	Mujaheddin	 commanders	based	in	Jalalabad.	A	small	 region	to	 the
south	and	east	of	Kabul	was	controlled	by	Gulbuddin	Hikmetyar.
       In	 the	north	the	Uzbek	 warlord	 General	Rashid	Dostum	held	sway	 over	six
provinces	and	in	 January	1994	he	had	abandoned	his	alliance	with	 the	 Rabbani
government	and	joined	 with	 Hikmetyar	 to	attack	 Kabul.	 In	central	 Afghanistan
the	Hazaras	 controlled	  the	province	  of	 Bamiyan.	  Southern	 Afghanistan	 and
Kandahar	were	divided	up	amongst	dozens	of	petty	ex-Mujaheddin	 warlords	and
bandits	who	 plundered	the	population	 at	 will.	 With	 the	 tribal	 structure	and	the
economy	 in	  tatters,	 no	 consensus	 on	 a	  Pashtun	leadership	  and	 Pakistan's
unwillingness	 to	provide	 military	 aid	 to	the	Durranis	 as	they	did	 to	 Hikmetyar,
the	Pashtuns	in	the	south	were	at	war	with	each	other.
       International	 aid	 agencies	were	fearful	of	 even	working	 in	Kandahar	as	the
city	 itself	 was	divided	 by	 warring	 groups.	Their	 leaders	sold	off	  everything	 to

44
Pakistani	traders	 to	 make	money,	 stripping	  down	 telephone	wires	 and	 poles,
cutting	 trees,	selling	  off	 factories,	 machinery	 and	 even	 road	 rollers	 to	 scrap
merchants.	The	warlords	seized	homes	and	farms,	threw	out	their	 occupants	and
handed	them	over	to	their	supporters.	The	commanders	abused	the	population	at
will,	  kidnapping	  young	  girls	  and	 boys	  for	  their	  sexual	 pleasure,	 robbing
merchants	in	 the	bazaars	and	 fighting	  and	brawling	  in	 the	streets.	Instead	 of
refugees	returning	  from	 Pakistan,	 a	 fresh	 wave	 of	  refugees	began	 to	 leave
Kandahar	for	Quetta.
       For	 the	powerful	 mafia	of	truck	 transporters	based	in	Quetta	and	Kandahar,
it	 was	an	 intolerable	 situation	 for	 business.	In	 1993	 I	 travelled	 the	short	 130
miles	by	 road	 from	 Quetta	 to	 Kandahar	and	 we	 were	stopped	by	 at	 least	20
different	groups,	who	had	put	chains	across	the	road	and	demanded	a	toll	for	free
passage.	The	transport	 mafia	 who	 were	trying	  to	 open	up	 routes	 to	 smuggle
goods	  between	  Quetta	  and	  Iran	  and	   the	  newly	   independent	  state	 of
Turkmenistan,	found	it	 impossible	to	do	business.
       For	 those	Mujaheddin	 who	had	fought	 the	Najibullah	  regime	and	had	then
gone	home	or	to	continue	their	studies	at	madrassas	in	Quetta	and	Kandahar,	the
situation	 was	particularly	  galling.	 ‘We	  all	 knew	 each	other	 –	Mullahs	  Omar,
Ghaus,	Mohammed	 Rabbani	(no	 relation	 to	 President	Rabbani)	 and	 myself	 –
because	we	were	all	originally	 from	Urozgan	 province	and	had	fought	together,’
said	 Mulla	   Hassan.	‘I	   moved	  back	 and	  forth	  from	  Quetta	 and	  attended
madrassas	there,	but	 whenever	we	 got	together	 we	 would	 discuss	the	terrible
plight	 of	 our	 people	living	  under	these	bandits.	 We	 were	people	 of	 the	same
opinions	and	we	 got	on	 with	 each	other	very	well,	 so	 it	was	easy	to	 come	to	a
decision	to	do	something,’	he	added.
       Mullah	  Mohammed	 Ghaus,	the	one-eyed	Foreign	 Minister	  of	the	 Taliban
said	much	the	same.	‘We	would	 sit	for	 a	long	time	to	 discuss	how	to	change	the
terrible	situation.	 Before	we	started	we	had	only	 vague	ideas	what	to	do	 and	we
thought	we	 would	  fail,	 but	 we	 believed	we	 were	 working	  with	 Allah	  as	His
pupils.	We	have	got	so	far	because	Allah	has	helped	us,’	said	Ghaus.4
       Other	 groups	 of	 Mujaheddin	 in	 the	 south	were	 also	discussing	 the	same
problems.	‘Many	  people	 were	 searching	for	  a	solution.	 I	  was	from	  Kalat	 in
Zabul	province	(85	 miles	north	of	 Kandahar)	and	had	joined	a	madrassa,	but	the
situation	was	so	bad	that	we	were	distracted	from	our	studies	and	with	a	group	of
friends	we	spent	all	 our	time	 discussing	what	we	should	 do	and	what	needed	to
be	done,’	said	 Mullah	 Mohammed	 Abbas,	who	 was	to	become	the	 Minister	 of
Public	 Health	in	 Kabul.’	  The	 old	 Mujaheddin	 leadership	 had	utterly	 failed	 to

45
bring	peace.	So	I	went	with	a	group	of	 friends	to	Herat	to	attend	the	Shura	called
by	Ismael	Khan,	but	 it	failed	 to	come	up	with	 a	solution	and	things	 were	getting
worse.	So	 we	came	 to	 Kandahar	to	 talk	 with	 Mullah	  Omar	 and	joined	 him,’
Abbas	added.
       After	 much	discussion	these	divergent	but	deeply	concerned	groups	chalked
out	an	agenda	which	 still	 remains	 the	Taliban's	 declared	aims	–	 restore	peace,
disarm	the	population,	 enforce	Sharia	 law	and	 defend	the	integrity	 and	Islamic
character	of	Afghanistan.	As	most	of	them	were	part-time	 or	full-time	 students	at
madrassas,	the	name	they	chose	for	themselves	was	natural.	A	talib	is	an	Islamic
student,	one	who	seeks	knowledge	compared	to	the	mullah	who	is	one	who	gives
knowledge.	By	  choosing	such	 a	name	the	 Taliban	 (plural	 of	 Talib)	  distanced
themselves	from	 the	 party	politics	  of	 the	 Mujaheddin	 and	signalled	 that	 they
were	a	movement	for	cleansing	society	rather	than	a	party	trying	to	grab	power.
       All	  those	 who	 gathered	around	Omar	 were	 the	children	 of	  the	jihad	 but
deeply	disillusioned	  with	 the	 factionalism	 and	 criminal	  activities	 of	 the	 once
idealised	Mujaheddin	  leadership.	 They	 saw	 themselves	as	 the	 cleansers	and
purifiers	 of	 a	 guerrilla	 war	 gone	 astray,	a	 social	 system	gone	 wrong	 and	 an
Islamic	way	 of	life	 that	had	been	compromised	by	 corruption	 and	excess.	Many
of	 them	 had	 been	 born	  in	 Pakistani	 refugee	 camps,	 educated	 in	 Pakistani
madrassas	and	had	learnt	their	fighting	 skills	 from	 Mujaheddin	 parties	based	in
Pakistan.	As	such	the	younger	Taliban	barely	knew	their	 own	country	 or	history,
but	from	 their	 madrassas	they	learnt	about	the	 ideal	Islamic	 society	 created	by
the	 Prophet	 Mohammed	 1,400	 years	 ago	 and	 this	 is	  what	 they	 wanted	 to
emulate.
       Some	Taliban	 say	Omar	 was	chosen	as	their	leader	not	 for	 his	political	 or
military	 ability,	 but	 for	his	 piety	and	his	 unswerving	belief	 in	 Islam.	Others	say
he	was	chosen	by	God.	 ‘We	 selected	Mullah	 Omar	 to	lead	this	 movement.	He
was	the	first	 amongst	equals	and	we	gave	him	 the	power	 to	lead	us	and	he	 has
given	us	the	 power	and	 authority	 to	deal	with	  people's	problems,’	 said	Mullah
Hassan.	 Omar	 himself	   gave	 a	  simple	  explanation	  to	 Pakistani	  journalist
Rahimullah	 Yousufzai.	 ‘We	 took	 up	 arms	to	 achieve	 the	aims	 of	 the	Afghan
jihad	and	 save	our	people	 from	 further	 suffering	 at	the	 hands	of	 the	so-called
Mujaheddin.	We	 had	complete	faith	in	 God	Almighty.	  We	never	forgot	 that.	He
can	bless	us	with	victory	or	plunge	us	into	defeat,’	 said	Omar.5
       No	 leader	in	the	world	 today	is	surrounded	by	as	much	secrecy	and	mystery
as	Mullah	Mohammed	 Omar.	Aged	 39,	he	has	never	been	photographed	or	met
with	 Western	diplomats	 and	journalists.	 His	 first	 meeting	 with	 a	UN	 diplomat

46
was	in	October	1998,	four	years	after	the	Taliban	emerged,	when	he	met	with	the
UN	 Special	  Representative	 for	  Afghanistan	  Lakhdar	 Brahimi,	   because	the
Taliban	 were	faced	 with	 a	possibly	 devastating	 attack	by	 Iran.	 Omar	 lives	 in
Kandahar	and	has	 visited	 the	capital	 Kabul	 twice	  and	only	 then	 very	 briefly.
Putting	together	 the	bare	facts	 of	 his	life	 has	 become	a	full-time	  job	 for	 most
Afghans	and	foreign	diplomats.
       Omar	 was	born	sometime	around	1959	in	Nodeh	village	 near	Kandahar	to	a
family	 of	 poor,	 landless	 peasants	who	were	 members	of	 the	 Hotak	 tribe,	 the
Ghilzai	branch	of	 Pashtuns.	The	Hotaki	chief	 Mir	 Wais,	had	captured	Isfahan	in
Iran	in	 1721	and	established	the	first	 Ghilzai	 Afghan	 empire	 in	Iran	 only	 to	be
quickly	 replaced	by	 Ahmad	 Shah	Durrani.	 Omar's	tribal	  and	social	 status	was
non-existent	and	notables	from	Kandahar	say	they	had	never	heard	of	his	family.
During	the	1980s	jihad	 his	family	 moved	to	Tarinkot	 in	 Urozgan	province	–	one
of	 the	 most	backward	 and	 inaccessible	 regions	of	  the	 country	 where	 Soviet
troops	rarely	penetrated.	His	father	died	 while	 he	was	a	young	man	and	the	task
of	fending	for	 his	mother	and	extended	family	fell	 upon	him.
       Looking	  for	a	 job,	he	moved	 to	Singesar	village	 in	the	Mewand	 district	 of
Kandahar	province,	 where	 he	became	the	 village	 mullah	  and	opened	a	 small
madrassa.	His	 own	 studies	in	 madrassas	in	 Kandahar	were	 interrupted	 twice,
first	by	the	Soviet	invasion	 and	then	by	the	creation	of	the	Taliban.6	Omar	joined
Khalis's	 Hizb-e-Islami	 and	 fought	 under	commander	 Nek	 Mohammed	 against
the	Najibullah	  regime	 between	1989	 and	1992.	 He	 was	wounded	 four	 times,
once	in	the	right	eye	which	is	now	permanently	 blinded.
       Despite	 the	success	of	the	Taliban,	 Singesar	is	still	 like	 any	 other	Pashtun
village.	 Mud-brick	 homes	plastered	with	  more	mud	 and	straw	are	built	  behind
high	 compound	 walls	  –	  a	 traditional	  defensive	 feature	 of	  Pashtun	 homes.
Narrow,	 dusty	 alleyways,	 which	  turn	 into	 mud	 baths	 when	it	  rains,	 connect
village	homes.	Omar's	madrassa	is	still	functioning	 –	a	small	mud	 hut	with	a	dirt
floor	 and	mattresses	strewn	across	it	 for	 the	boys	 to	sleep	on.	 Omar	has	three
wives,	who	 continue	living	 in	 the	village	 and	are	heavily	 veiled.	While	 his	 first
and	third	 wives	are	 from	 Urozgan,	his	 teenage	second	wife	Guljana,	 whom	 he
married	 in	 1995,	 is	 from	 Singesar.	 He	 has	a	 total	 of	 five	  children	 who	 are
studying	in	his	madrassa.7
       A	 tall,	well-built	  man	with	 a	long,	black	beard	and	a	black	turban,	Omar	has
a	dry	  sense	of	  humour	 and	 a	 sarcastic	 wit.	  He	 remains	 extremely	  shy	 of
outsiders,	particularly	 foreigners,	 but	he	is	 accessible	to	the	Taliban.	 When	 the
movement	started	 he	 would	 offer	 his	 Friday	  prayers	at	 the	 main	 mosque	in

47
Kandahar	and	mix	with	 the	people,	but	subsequently	he	has	become	much	more
of	a	recluse,	rarely	 venturing	 outside	Kandahar's	administrative	 mansion	where
he	lives.	He	 now	visits	 his	 village	 infrequently	 and	when	 he	does	he	is	always
accompanied	by	dozens	of	bodyguards	in	a	convoy	 of	deluxe	Japanese	jeepsters
with	darkened	windows.
       Omar	 speaks	very	little	in	 Shura	meetings,	listening	to	other	points	of	 view.
His	shyness	makes	him	 a	 poor	public	 speaker	and	 despite	the	mythology	  that
now	 surrounds	 him,	  he	 has	little	   charismatic	 appeal.	 All	  day	 he	 conducts
business	from	a	small	office	in	 the	mansion.	At	 first	he	used	to	sit	on	the	cement
floor	alongside	visiting	  Taliban,	but	he	now	 sits	on	a	bed	while	 others	sit	on	the
floor	 –	a	move	 that	emphasises	his	status	as	leader.	 He	has	several	secretaries
who	 take	 notes	from	  his	 conversations	 with	 commanders,	 ordinary	 soldiers,
ulema	 and	 plaintiffs	   and	 there	 is	  always	  the	 crackle	  of	 wireless	  sets	 as
commanders	around	the	country	communicate	with	him.
       Business	 consists	of	 lengthy	 debate	 and	discussions	which	  end	with	  the
issuing	of	 ‘chits’	 or	 scraps	of	paper	on	 which	 are	written	 instructions	 allowing
commanders	to	 make	 an	 attack,	 ordering	 a	 Taliban	 governor	  to	 help	 out	 a
plaintiff	  or	 a	 message	to	 UN	 mediators.	 Formal	  communications	 to	 foreign
embassies	in	Islamabad	were	frequently	dictated	by	Pakistani	advisers.
       In	 the	 early	 days	of	 the	movement	 I	 collected	numerous	 chits	written	  on
cigarette	boxes	or	wrapping	 paper,	allowing	 me	to	travel	from	 city	 to	city.	 Now
more	regular	 paper	pads	are	used.	 Beside	Omar	 is	a	 tin	 trunk	 from	 which	 he
dishes	out	 wads	of	  Afghani	 notes	 to	 commanders	and	 plaintiffs	  in	 need.	As
success	came,	another	tin	 trunk	 was	 added	–	 this	 one	containing	 US	 dollars.
These	tin	trunks	are	the	treasury	of	the	Taliban	movement.
       In	 important	 meetings,	Mullah	 Wakil	 Ahmad,	Omar's	trusted	confidant	 and
official	 spokesman	is	usually	beside	him.	Wakil,	 a	young	madrassa	student	from
the	Kakar	 tribe	who	 studied	under	 Omar,	started	out	 as	his	companion,	 driver,
food	 taster,	translator	 and	note-taker.	 He	 quickly	  progressed	to	 higher	things
such	as	communicating	with	 visiting	 foreign	 diplomats	and	aid	agency	officials,
travelling	 to	meet	Taliban	commanders	and	meeting	with	 Pakistani	 officials.	 As
Omar's	spokesman	he	is	the	Taliban's	main	contact	with	the	foreign	press	as	well
as	its	 chastizer,	when	 he	feels	 that	journalists	  have	criticized	  the	Taliban	 too
harshly.	Wakil	  acts	 as	Omar's	 ears	and	eyes	 and	is	 also	 his	 doorkeeper.	No
important	Afghan	 can	reach	Omar	without	first	going	 through	Wakil.
       There	 is	now	 an	entire	 factory	 of	myths	 and	stories	to	 explain	 how	Omar
mobilized	 a	small	 group	 of	 Taliban	 against	the	 rapacious	Kandahar	 warlords.

48
The	most	credible	 story,	 told	repeatedly,	 is	that	in	 the	spring	 of	 1994	Singesar
neighbours	came	to	tell	 him	 that	a	commander	had	abducted	two	 teenage	girls,
their	heads	had	 been	shaved	and	they	 had	been	taken	 to	a	 military	  camp	and
repeatedly	raped.	Omar	enlisted	some	30	Talibs	who	 had	only	16	rifles	 between
them	and	attacked	the	base,	freeing	the	 girls	 and	hanging	the	commander	from
the	barrel	of	a	tank.	They	captured	quantities	of	arms	and	ammunition.	‘We	 were
fighting	 against	 Muslims	 who	 had	 gone	 wrong.	 How	 could	 we	 remain	 quiet
when	we	could	see	crimes	being	committed	against	women	and	the	poor?’	Omar
said	later.8
       A	 few	 months	later	two	commanders	confronted	each	other	in	Kandahar,	in
a	dispute	over	a	young	boy	whom	both	men	wanted	to	sodomise.	In	the	fight	that
followed	 civilians	 were	 killed.	 Omar's	 group	freed	 the	boy	 and	public	 appeals
started	coming	in	 for	 the	Taliban	 to	help	 out	in	 other	local	 disputes.	Omar	had
emerged	as	 a	 Robin	  Hood	  figure,	  helping	 the	  poor	 against	 the	 rapacious
commanders.	His	prestige	grew	 because	he	asked	for	no	 reward	or	 credit	from
those	he	helped,	only	 demanding	that	 they	follow	  him	 to	 set	up	a	just	 Islamic
system.
       At	  the	 same	 time	 Omar's	 emissaries	 were	 gauging	 the	 mood	 of	  other
commanders.	His	 colleagues	 visited	 Herat	 to	 meet	with	  Ismael	 Khan	 and	in
September	Mulla	  Mohammed	 Rabbani,	 a	 founding	  member	 of	 the	 Taliban,
visited	 Kabul	  and	  held	 talks	  with	  President	 Rabbani.	 The	  isolated	 Kabul
government	 wished	 to	  support	 any	 new	  Pashtun	 force	 that	  would	  oppose
Hikmetyar,	 who	 was	 still	  shelling	 Kabul,	 and	 Rabbani	 promised	to	 help	 the
Taliban	with	 funds	if	they	opposed	Hikmetyar.
       However	  the	 Taliban's	 closest	links	  were	with	  Pakistan	where	 many	 of
them	had	 grown	 up	 and	studied	 in	 madrassas	run	 by	 the	mercurial	 Maulana
Fazlur	 Rehman	and	 his	 Jamiat-e-Ulema	 Islam	  (JUI),	 a	 fundamentalist	 party
which	 had	considerable	 support	amongst	 the	Pashtuns	in	 Baluchistan	 and	the
North	 West	 Frontier	 Province	 (NWFP).	 More	  significantly	  Maulana	 Rehman
was	now	a	political	 ally	 of	 Prime	Minister	 Benazir	 Bhutto	and	he	had	 access	to
the	government,	the	army	and	the	ISI	to	whom	he	described	this	newly	 emerging
force.
       Pakistan's	 Afghan	 policy	 was	 in	 the	 doldrums.	 After	 the	 collapse	of	 the
Soviet	Union	 in	 1991,	successive	Pakistani	governments	were	desperately	keen
to	open	up	direct	land	routes	for	trade	with	 the	Central	Asian	 Republics	(CARs).
The	major	hindrance	was	the	continuing	civil	 war	 in	Afghanistan,	through	 which
any	route	 passed.	Pakistan's	 policy-makers	  were	 thus	faced	 with	  a	 strategic

49
dilemma.	Either	 Pakistan	could	carry	 on	backing	 Hikmetyar	 in	 a	bid	to	 bring	 a
Pashtun	group	to	power	in	 Kabul	 which	 would	be	 Pakistan-friendly,	 or	it	 could
change	direction	and	urge	for	a	power-sharing	agreement	between	all	the	Afghan
factions	at	whatever	the	price	for	the	Pashtuns,	so	that	a	stable	government	could
open	the	roads	to	Central	Asia.
       The	 Pakistani	military	 was	convinced	that	other	ethnic	groups	would	 not	do
their	bidding	and	continued	to	 back	Hikmetyar.	Some	20	per	cent	of	the	Pakistan
army	 was	 made	up	 of	  Pakistani	 Pashtuns	and	 the	 pro-Pashtun	 and	 Islamic
fundamentalist	 lobby	 within	  the	ISI	 and	 the	 military	  remained	determined	 to
achieve	a	 Pashtun	victory	 in	  Afghanistan.	 However,	 by	 1994	 Hikmetyar	 had
clearly	failed,	losing	 ground	militarily	  while	 his	extremism	divided	 the	Pashtuns,
the	majority	 of	whom	 loathed	him.	Pakistan	was	getting	 tired	of	 backing	a	loser
and	was	looking	around	for	other	potential	Pashtun	proxies.
       When	 Benazir	Bhutto	 was	elected	as	Prime	Minister	 in	1993,	she	was	keen
to	open	a	route	to	Central	Asia.	 The	shortest	route	was	from	Peshawar	to	Kabul,
across	the	Hindu	  Kush	 mountains	to	 Mazar-e-Sharif	 and	 then	 to	Tirmez	  and
Tashkent	in	 Uzbekistan,	 but	 this	route	 was	closed	 due	to	 the	 fighting	 around
Kabul.	 A	 new	 proposal	 emerged,	backed	strongly	  by	 the	frustrated	 Pakistani
transport	 and	 smuggling	 mafia,	  the	 JUI	  and	 Pashtun	military	   and	 political
officials.	 Instead	of	 the	northern	route	the	 way	could	 be	cleared	from	 Quetta	to
Kandahar,	Herat	and	on	 to	Ashkhabad,	the	 capital	of	 Turkmenistan.	 There	was
no	fighting	  in	 the	 south,	only	 dozens	of	 commanders	 who	 would	 have	to	 be
adequately	bribed	before	they	agreed	to	open	the	chains.
       In	 September	1994	Pakistani	surveyors	and	ISI	 officers	 discreetly	travelled
the	road	from	Chaman	on	the	 Pakistani	border	to	Herat,	 to	survey	the	road.	The
Pashtun-born	Interior	  Minister	   Naseerullah	 Babar	 also	 visited	  Chaman	that
month.	The	 Kandahar	 warlords	 viewed	 the	plan	 with	 mistrust,	 suspecting	 the
Pakistanis	 were	 about	 to	  try	  and	 intervene	 militarily	   to	  crush	 them.	  One
commander,	Amir	Lalai,	 issued	a	blunt	warning	to	Babar.	‘Pakistan	is	offering	 to
reconstruct	our	roads,	 but	I	 do	not	 think	 that	 by	fixing	  our	roads	 peace	would
automatically	follow.	  As	long	 as	neighbouring	countries	 continue	to	interfere	 in
our	internal	affairs,	we	should	not	expect	peace,’	said	Lalai.9
       Nevertheless,	the	Pakistanis	began	to	negotiate	with	 the	Kandahar	warlords
and	Ismael	 Khan	 in	  Herat	 to	 allow	 traffic	  through	 to	 Turkmenistan.	  On	 20
October	1994,	Babar	took	 a	party	of	 six	Western	 ambassadors	to	Kandahar	and
Herat,	without	 even	informing	 the	Kabul	 government.10The	delegation	included
senior	officials	  from	 the	departments	of	 Railways,	 Highways,	 Telephones	and

50
Electricity.	 Babar	 said	 he	wanted	 to	 raise	US$300	 million	  from	  international
agencies	to	rebuild	 the	highway	 from	 Quetta	 to	Herat.	 On	28	 October,	Bhutto
met	with	  Ismael	Khan	 and	 General	 Rashid	Dostum	 in	 Ashkhabad	 and	urged
them	to	agree	to	open	a	southern	route,	where	trucks	would	 pay	just	a	couple	 of
tolls	on	the	way	and	their	security	would	 be	guaranteed.
       However,	  before	 that	 meeting	 a	 major	 event	 had	 shaken	the	 Kandahar
warlords.	On	 12	October	1994	 some	200	Taliban	 from	Kandahar	 and	Pakistani
madrassas	arrived	 at	 the	 small	  Afghan	 border	 post	 of	  Spin	 Baldak	 on	 the
Pakistan–Afghanistan	border	just	 opposite	Chaman.	The	grimy	 grease	pit	in	 the
middle	of	the	desert	was	an	important	trucking	 and	fuelling	 stop	for	the	transport
mafia	and	was	 held	by	 Hikmetyar's	 men.	Here	Afghan	 trucks	 picked	up	 goods
from	Pakistani	trucks,	which	 were	not	allowed	to	 cross	into	Afghanistan	and	fuel
was	smuggled	in	 from	 Pakistan	to	feed	 the	warlords’	 armies.	 For	the	transport
mafia,	 control	  of	 the	 town	  was	 critical.	  They	 had	 already	 donated	 several
hundred	thousand	Pakistani	 Rupees	to	 Mullah	 Omar	 and	promised	 a	monthly
stipend	to	the	 Taliban,	if	 they	 would	 clear	the	 roads	of	chains	 and	bandits	and
guarantee	the	security	for	truck	traffic.11
       The	  Taliban	 force	  divided	 into	  three	 groups	 and	 attacked	 Hikmetyar's
garrison.	After	  a	short,	 sharp	 battle	they	 fled,	  losing	 seven	dead	and	 several
wounded.	The	Taliban	 lost	 only	 one	man.	Pakistan	then	 helped	the	Taliban	 by
allowing	 them	to	capture	a	large	 arms	dump	outside	Spin	 Baldak	that	 had	been
guarded	by	Hikmetyar's	men.	This	dump	had	been	moved	across	the	border	from
Pakistan	into	  Afghanistan	 in	 1990,	 when	  the	terms	 of	  the	 Geneva	Accords
obliged	Islamabad	not	to	hold	weapons	for	Afghans	 on	Pakistani	territory.	 At	the
dump	the	Taliban	 seized	some	18,000	 kalashnikovs,	dozens	of	 artillery	 pieces,
large	quantities	of	ammunition	 and	many	vehicles.12
       The	  capture	 of	 Spin	  Baldak	 worried	  the	 Kandahar	 warlords	  and	 they
denounced	Pakistan	 for	  backing	  the	 Taliban,	 but	  they	 continued	  bickering
amongst	themselves	rather	than	uniting	 to	meet	the	new	 threat.	Babar	was	now
getting	impatient	 and	he	ordered	a	30	 truck	test-convoy	 to	travel	 to	Ashkhabad
with	a	 load	of	medicines.	 ‘I	 told	Babar	 we	should	wait	 two	 months	because	we
had	no	  agreements	with	  the	 Kandahar	 commanders,	 but	 Babar	 insisted	 on
pushing	the	 convoy	 through.	The	 commanders	suspected	that	the	 convoy	 was
carrying	 arms	  for	  a	 future	  Pakistani	 force,’	  a	  Pakistani	 official	   based	 in
Kandahar	later	told	me.13
       On	 29	October	1994,	the	convoy	 drawn	from	 the	army's	National	 Logistics
Cell	(NLC),	 which	 had	been	set	up	in	the	1980s	by	the	ISI	 to	funnel	US	 arms	to

51
the	Mujaheddin,	 left	 Quetta	with	 80	 Pakistani	ex-army	 drivers.	 Colonel	 Imam,
the	ISI's	  most	 prominent	 field	  officer	  operating	 in	 the	 south	 and	 Pakistan's
Consul	General	in	 Herat,	 was	also	on	 board.	Along	 with	 him	 were	 two	young
Taliban	commanders,	Mullahs	  Borjan	and	 Turabi.	 (Both	 were	later	to	 lead	the
Taliban's	first	 assault	 on	Kabul	 where	 Mullah	 Borjan	 was	 to	 meet	his	 death.)
Twelve	miles	 outside	Kandahar,	at	 Takht-e-Pul	near	the	 perimeter	of	 Kandahar
airport,	the	convoy	 was	held	up	by	a	group	of	 commanders,	Amir	 Lalai,	Mansur
Achakzai,	who	controlled	 the	airport,	and	Ustad	Halim.	 The	convoy	was	ordered
to	park	in	a	nearby	village	at	the	foot	of	 low-lying	 mountains.	When	I	 walked	the
area	a	few	months	later	the	remains	of	camp	fires	and	discarded	rations	were	still
evident.
       The	 commanders	demanded	money,	a	share	of	the	goods	and	that	Pakistan
stop	supporting	the	Taliban.	As	 the	commanders	negotiated	with	Colonel	 Imam,
Islamabad	imposed	a	news	 blackout	 for	three	 days	on	the	 convoy	 hijack.	 ‘We
were	worried	 that	 Mansur	would	  put	arms	aboard	 the	convoy	 and	then	 blame
Pakistan.	So	we	considered	all	the	military	 options	to	rescue	the	convoy,	such	as
a	raid	by	the	Special	Services	Group	(Pakistan	army	commandos)	or	a	parachute
drop.	These	options	were	considered	too	dangerous	so	we	then	asked	the	Taliban
to	free	the	convoy,’	 said	a	Pakistani	 official.	 On	 3	November	1994,	 the	Taliban
moved	in	to	attack	those	holding	the	convoy.	The	commanders,	thinking	 this	was
a	raid	 by	 the	Pakistani	 army,	 fled.	 Mansur	was	 chased	into	 the	desert	 by	the
Taliban,	captured	and	shot	dead	with	 ten	of	his	bodyguards.	His	 body	was	hung
from	a	tank	barrel	for	all	 to	see.
       That	 same	evening,	the	Taliban	moved	 on	Kandahar	where,	after	 two	days
of	sporadic	 fighting	  they	routed	 the	 commanders’	forces.	 Mullah	  Naquib,	 the
most	prominent	commander	inside	the	city	 who	 commanded	2,500	men,	did	not
resist.	Some	of	his	aides	later	claimed	 that	Naquib	 had	taken	a	substantial	bribe
from	the	 ISI	 to	surrender,	with	 the	promise	 that	he	would	 retain	 his	command.
The	 Taliban	 enlisted	 his	 men	 and	 retired	 the	 Mullah	  to	 his	 village	  outside
Kandahar.	 The	 Taliban	  captured	 dozens	 of	  tanks,	 armoured	 cars,	 military
vehicles,	weapons	and	most	significantly	  at	the	 airport	six	 Mig-21	 fighters	 and
six	transport	helicopters	–	left-overs	from	 the	Soviet	occupation.
       In	  just	 a	couple	 of	 weeks	 this	 unknown	 force	  had	captured	 the	 second
largest	city	 in	 Afghanistan	with	  the	loss	of	 just	 a	dozen	men.	In	 Islamabad	no
foreign	diplomat	 or	analyst	doubted	 that	they	had	received	considerable	support
from	Pakistan.	The	fall	 of	 Kandahar	was	celebrated	by	the	Pakistan	government
and	the	 JUI.	  Babar	 took	 credit	 for	  the	 Taliban's	 success,	telling	  journalists

52
privately	 that	the	 Taliban	were	 ‘our	 boys’.	 Yet	 the	Taliban	 demonstrated	their
independence	from	Pakistan,	indicating	 that	 they	were	 nobody's	puppet.	On	 16
November	1994	Mullah	 Ghaus	said	that	Pakistan	should	 not	bypass	the	Taliban
in	 sending	 convoys	 in	 the	 future	  and	 should	 not	 cut	 deals	 with	  individual
warlords.	He	also	said	the	Taliban	would	 not	allow	goods	bound	for	 Afghanistan
to	be	carried	by	Pakistani	trucks	–	a	key	demand	of	the	transport	mafia.14
       The	 Taliban	cleared	the	chains	from	 the	roads,	set	up	a	one-toll	 system	for
trucks	 entering	 Afghanistan	 at	 Spin	 Baldak	 and	 patrolled	 the	 highway	 from
Pakistan.	The	transport	 mafia	was	 ecstatic	and	in	 December	the	 first	 Pakistani
convoy	of	 50	trucks	 carrying	 raw	cotton	 from	 Turkmenistan	 arrived	 in	Quetta,
after	 paying	  the	  Taliban	 200,000	  rupees	 (US$5,000)	  in	  tolls.	  Meanwhile
thousands	of	 young	Afghan	  Pashtuns	studying	in	 Baluchistan	 and	 the	NWFP
rushed	to	Kandahar	to	 join	 the	Taliban.	 They	were	 soon	followed	 by	 Pakistani
volunteers	 from	  JUI	  madrassas,	  who	 were	  inspired	  by	  the	 new	  Islamic
movement	 in	  Afghanistan.	  By	  December	 1994,	 some	 12,000	  Afghan	  and
Pakistani	students	had	joined	the	Taliban	in	Kandahar.
       As	 international	 and	domestic	pressure	mounted	on	 Pakistan	to	explain	 its
position,	 Bhutto	 made	the	 first	 formal	 denial	 of	 any	 Pakistani	backing	 of	 the
Taliban	in	February	 1995.	‘We	have	no	favourites	 in	Afghanistan	 and	we	do	not
interfere	 in	  Afghanistan,’	   she	 said	 while	   visiting	  Manila.15Later	  she	 said
Pakistan	could	not	stop	new	recruits	from	crossing	the	border	to	join	 the	Taliban.
‘I	 cannot	fight	 Mr	 [President	 Burhanuddin]	 Rabbani's	war	 for	 him.	 If	 Afghans
want	to	cross	the	border,	I	do	not	stop	them.	I	can	stop	them	from	re-entering	but
most	of	them	have	families	here,’	she	said.16
       The	 Taliban	immediately	 implemented	 the	strictest	interpretation	 of	 Sharia
law	ever	seen	in	the	Muslim	 world.	 They	closed	down	girls’	 schools	and	banned
women	from	working	 outside	the	home,	smashed	TV	sets,	forbade	a	whole	array
of	sports	and	recreational	activities	and	ordered	all	males	to	grow	long	 beards.	In
the	next	three	months	the	Taliban	were	to	 take	control	of	 12	of	Afghanistan's	 31
provinces,	opening	 the	 roads	to	 traffic	  and	 disarming	 the	population.	  As	 the
Taliban	 marched	north	 to	 Kabul,	 local	 warlords	  either	fled	  or,	waving	  white
flags,	surrendered	to	them.	 Mullah	 Omar	and	his	 army	of	 students	were	on	 the
march	across	Afghanistan.

                                            HERAT	      1995:
                                   GOD'S	     INVINCIBLE
                                               SOLDIERS

	



In	 March	1995,	on	the	northern	edge	of	the	Dashte-e-Mango	–	the	Desert	of
Death	–	plumes	of	fine	white	dust	rose	in	the	air	above	the	narrow	ribbon	of	the
battered	highway	that	connects	Kandahar	with	Herat,	350	 miles	away.	 The
highway,	built	by	the	Russians	in	the	1950s	skirted	through	the	brush	and	sands
of	one	of	the	hottest	and	most	waterless	deserts	in	the	world.	After	years	of	war,
the	highway	was	now	rutted	with	tank	tracks,	bomb	craters	and	broken	bridges,
slowing	down	the	traffic	to	just	20	miles	an	hour.
       The	Taliban	war	 wagons	–	Japanese	two-door	pick-ups	with	a	stripped-
down	trunk	at	the	back	open	to	the	elements	–	were	streaming	towards	Herat
laden	with	heavily	 armed	young	men	in	their	 bid	to	 capture	the	city.	In	 the
opposite	direction	a	steady	flow	of	vehicles	was	bringing	back	wounded	Taliban
lying	on	string	beds	and	strapped	into	the	trunk	as	well	as	prisoners	captured
from	the	forces	of	Ismael	Khan	who	held	Herat.
       In	the	first	three	months	after	capturing	Kandahar,	the	Taliban	had	broken
the	stalemate	in	the	 Afghan	civil	  war	by	 capturing	12	 of	 Afghanistan's	31
provinces	and	had	arrived	at	the	outskirts	of	Kabul	to	the	north	and	Herat	in	the
west.	Taliban	soldiers	were	reluctant	to	talk	under	the	gaze	of	their	commanders
in	Kandahar	so	the	only	way	to	learn	something	about	them	was	to	hitch	lifts
along	the	road	and	back	again.	In	the	confines	of	the	pick-ups	where	a	dozen
warriors	were	jam-packed	with	crates	of	ammunition,	rockets,	grenade	launchers
and	sacks	of	wheat,	they	were	more	than	eager	to	share	their	life	stories.
       They	said	that	since	the	capture	of	Kandahar	some	20,000	Afghans	and
hundreds	of	Pakistani	madrassa	students	had	streamed	across	the	border	from
refugee	camps	in	 Pakistan	to	join	  Mullah	 Omar.	Thousands	more	Afghan
Pashtuns	had	joined	 them	in	  their	 march	northwards.	The	 majority	  were
incredibly	young	–	between	14	and	24	years	old	–	and	many	had	never	fought
before	although,	like	all	Pashtuns,	they	knew	how	to	handle	a	weapon.

55
       Many	 had	spent	their	lives	 in	refugee	camps	in	 Baluchistan	and	the	NWFP
provinces	of	Pakistan,	interspersed	with	stints	at	imbibing	 a	Koranic	education	in
the	dozens	of	 madrassas	that	 had	sprung	 up	along	 the	border	 run	 by	 Afghan
mullahs	 or	 Pakistan's	 Islamic	  fundamentalist	 parties.	 Here	 they	  studied	 the
Koran,	the	sayings	of	 the	Prophet	 Mohammed	and	the	basics	of	 Islamic	 law	 as
interpreted	by	their	barely	literate	teachers.	Neither	teachers	nor	students	had	any
formal	grounding	 in	maths,	science,	history	 or	geography.	Many	 of	these	young
warriors	did	 not	even	know	 the	history	 of	 their	own	 country	 or	the	story	 of	the
jihad	against	the	Soviets.
       These	 boys	were	 a	world	 apart	 from	 the	Mujaheddin	 whom	 I	 had	 got	to
know	during	 the	1980s	–	 men	who	could	 recount	their	 tribal	 and	clan	lineages,
remembered	their	 abandoned	farms	 and	valleys	 with	  nostalgia	 and	recounted
legends	and	stories	 from	 Afghan	 history.	 These	boys	 were	 from	 a	generation
who	had	 never	seen	their	 country	 at	 peace	–	an	 Afghanistan	 not	 at	war	 with
invaders	and	 itself.	 They	 had	 no	 memories	of	  their	 tribes,	 their	 elders,	their
neighbours	nor	 the	 complex	 ethnic	 mix	  of	 peoples	that	 often	 made	 up	 their
villages	and	their	 homeland.	These	boys	were	what	 the	war	 had	thrown	up	 like
the	sea's	surrender	on	the	beach	of	history.
       They	 had	no	memories	of	the	past,	no	plans	for	 the	future	while	 the	present
was	everything.	They	 were	literally	 the	 orphans	of	the	war,	 the	rootless	and	the
restless,	the	jobless	 and	the	economically	  deprived	 with	 little	 self-knowledge.
They	admired	war	because	it	was	the	only	 occupation	they	could	 possibly	adapt
to.	Their	 simple	 belief	in	 a	messianic,	puritan	 Islam	 which	 had	been	drummed
into	them	by	simple	 village	mullahs	 was	the	only	prop	they	could	 hold	on	to	and
which	  gave	 their	  lives	  some	 meaning.	  Untrained	  for	  anything,	  even	 the
traditional	 occupations	 of	  their	 forefathers	  such	as	 farming,	  herding	 or	  the
making	  of	  handicrafts,	  they	  were	  what	  Karl	  Marx	   would	  have	  termed
Afghanistan's	lumpen	proletariat.
       Moreover,	 they	 had	willingly	  gathered	under	the	all-male	 brotherhood	that
the	Taliban	 leaders	were	 set	on	 creating,	 because	they	knew	 of	 nothing	 else.
Many	in	 fact	were	orphans	who	had	grown	 up	without	 women	–mothers,	sisters
or	cousins.	Others	were	madrassa	students	or	had	lived	 in	 the	strict	 confines	of
segregated	refugee	camp	life,	 where	the	normal	 comings	and	 goings	of	 female
relatives	 were	 curtailed.	 Even	  by	 the	 norms	 of	  conservative	 Pashtun	tribal
society,	where	villages	or	 nomadic	camps	were	close-knit	communities	 and	men
still	mixed	 with	 women	to	 whom	they	were	related,	 these	boys	had	lived	rough,
tough	lives.	They	had	simply	never	known	 the	company	of	women.

56
       The	 mullahs	who	 had	taught	them	stressed	that	women	were	 a	temptation,
an	unnecessary	distraction	from	being	 of	service	 to	Allah.	 So	when	 the	Taliban
entered	Kandahar	and	 confined	 women	 to	 their	 homes	by	 barring	 them	from
working,	  going	 to	  school	 and	 even	  from	 shopping,	  the	 majority	  of	  these
madrassa	boys	saw	nothing	 unusual	in	 such	measures.	They	felt	 threatened	by
that	half	of	 the	human	race	which	they	had	never	known	 and	it	was	much	 easier
to	lock	that	half	 away,	especially	if	 it	 was	ordained	by	the	mullahs	 who	invoked
primitive	   Islamic	  injunctions,	   which	  had	  no	  basis	 in	   Islamic	  law.	  The
subjugation	  of	  women	  became	 the	  mission	  of	  the	  true	  believer	  and	 a
fundamental	marker	that	differentiated	the	Taliban	 from	the	former	Mujaheddin.
       This	 male	brotherhood	offered	these	youngsters	not	just	a	religious	cause	to
fight	 for,	 but	 a	whole	 way	 of	 life	  to	 fully	 embrace	 and	make	 their	 existence
meaningful.	 Ironically,	   the	Taliban	  were	 a	 direct	 throwback	  to	 the	 military
religious	orders	 that	arose	in	Christendom	 during	 the	Crusades	to	fight	 Islam	–
disciplined,	 motivated	  and	ruthless	 in	 attaining	  their	 aims.1	In	  the	 first	 few
months	the	 sweeping	victories	  of	 the	Taliban	 created	an	 entire	 mythology	 of
invincibility	  that	only	God's	own	 soldiers	could	attain.	In	those	heady	early	days,
every	victory	 only	 reinforced	the	perceived	 truth	of	 their	mission,	 that	God	was
on	their	side	and	that	their	interpretation	of	Islam	 was	the	only	interpretation.
       Reinforced	 by	their	new	recruits,	the	Taliban	 moved	north	into	Urozgan	and
Zabul	provinces	which	 they	captured	without	 a	shot	being	fired.	 The	marauding
Pashtun	commanders,	unwilling	 to	 test	their	 own	supporters’	 uncertain	loyalty,
surrendered	by	hoisting	white	flags	 and	handing	over	their	weapons	in	a	mark	of
submission.
       In	 the	south	the	Taliban	 moved	against	the	 forces	of	Ghaffar	 Akhunzadeh,
whose	clan	 had	 controlled	 Helmand	 province	 and	 its	 lucrative	 opium	  poppy
fields	 for	 much	 of	  the	 1980s.	Here	 they	 met	 with	  fierce	 resistance,	 but	 by
propping	up	 smaller	drug	 warlords	against	Akhunzadeh	 and	bribing	 others,	the
Taliban	 captured	 the	 province	 by	 January	 1995.	 They	 continued	  westwards
reaching	Dilaram	 on	 the	Kandahar–Herat	highway	 and	 the	border	 of	the	 three
western	provinces	 controlled	 by	 Ismael	 Khan.	 At	 the	 same	time	 they	 moved
north	towards	Kabul,	easily	slicing	 through	the	Pashtun	belt	where	they	met	with
more	mass	surrenders	rather	than	resistance.
       The	 chaotic	 and	anarchic	 Pashtun	south,	where	 there	was	only	 a	 mob	 of
petty	 commanders,	had	 fallen	 to	 the	 Taliban	  easily,	 but	 now	 they	 came	 up
against	the	major	warlords	and	the	political	 and	ethnic	complexities	 that	gripped
the	rest	of	 the	 country.	 In	 January	1995	 all	 the	opposition	  groups	had	joined

57
hands	to	attack	President	Rabbani's	government	in	 Kabul.	Hikmetyar	 had	allied
with	the	Uzbek	 warlord	 General	Rashid	Dostum	in	the	 north	and	the	Hazaras	of
central	Afghanistan	who	 held	a	portion	of	 Kabul.	Pakistan	had	helped	broker	the
new	 alliance	 as	 Hikmetyar	  was	 still	  Islamabad's	clear	 favourite	  and	 at	 the
beginning	 of	 the	 year	 he	had	 received	 large	 quantities	 of	 Pakistani-supplied
rockets	to	bombard	 the	capital.	 But	even	Islamabad	 was	surprised	by	 the	rapid
Taliban	advance.	Although	 the	Bhutto	government	 fully	 backed	the	Taliban,	the
ISI	 remained	sceptical	 of	 their	 abilities,	  convinced	 that	they	 would	  remain	a
useful	but	peripheral	force	in	the	south.
       Hikmetyar	  was	 clearly	 worried	 by	 this	 rival	  Pashtun	force	 sweeping	 up
from	 the	south	and	 tried	to	 halt	 the	Taliban	 while	 at	 the	same	time	 launching
massive	rocket	 attacks	against	 Kabul,	 which	 killed	  hundreds	of	 civilians	  and
destroyed	large	 tracts	of	 the	 city.	 On	 2	 February	 1995,	 the	Taliban	 captured
Wardak,	just	35	miles	south	of	 Kabul	and	Hikmetyar's	 bases	around	Kabul	came
under	threat	 for	 the	first	 time.	 The	 Taliban	 continued	 to	advance	 in	lightning
moves,	capturing	Maidan	Shahr	on	10	February	1995,	after	heavy	fighting	 which
left	200	 dead,	and	Mohammed	Agha	 the	next	day.	Hikmetyar	 was	 now	trapped
by	government	forces	 to	the	 north	and	the	 Taliban	to	 the	south;	morale	 among
his	troops	plummeted.
       On	 14	 February	 1995	 the	 Taliban	 captured	 Hikmetyar's	 headquarters	at
Charasyab,	creating	panic	among	his	 troops	and	forcing	 them	to	 flee	eastwards
towards	Jalalabad.	President	Rabbani's	troops,	under	his	swordarm	Ahmad	Shah
Masud,	 withdrew	  into	 Kabul	  city.	  The	 Taliban	  then	 opened	 all	 the	 roads,
allowing	 food	convoys	to	 reach	Kabul	after	 the	months	of	blockade	 imposed	by
Hikmetyar.	 It	 was	 a	 popular	 step,	raising	 the	 Taliban's	 prestige	 amongst	the
sceptical	citizens	 of	 Kabul	 and	 fulfilled	  a	key	 demand	 of	 the	transport	 mafia
backing	the	Taliban.	 Appeals	for	 a	cease-fire	by	the	UN	 Special	Representative
for	 Afghanistan,	  the	 Tunisean	diplomat	  Mehmoud	 Mestiri,	  were	 ignored	  as
Masud	and	the	Taliban	now	confronted	each	other.
       Masud	 had	another	problem	even	closer	to	home.	Although	 Hikmetyar	 had
been	forced	to	 flee,	Masud	 still	 faced	the	forces	 of	the	 Shia	Hazaras	under	the
Hizb-e-Wahadat	party,	 which	 held	 the	southern	 suburbs	of	 the	capital.	 Masud
tried	to	buy	time	 and	met	twice	with	 the	Taliban	commanders,	Mullahs	 Rabbani,
Borjan	 and	Ghaus	at	 Charasayab.	These	meetings	were	 the	first	 time	 that	 the
Taliban	were	 to	meet	with	 their	 greatest	rival,	 who	 was	to	persist	 in	punishing
them	for	 the	 next	four	 years.	 The	Taliban	 demanded	Rabbani's	resignation	 as
President	and	Masud's	surrender	 –	hardly	 a	negotiating	 stance	that	 would	 win

58
them	support.	The	Taliban	also	began	negotiating	with	the	Hazaras.
       The	 Taliban	 also	 met	with	 Mestiri,	  the	 UN	 mediator,	 setting	down	 three
conditions	 for	 their	  participation	  in	 any	 UN-sponsored	 peace	process.	 They
demanded	that	 their	 units	 form	  a	 ‘neutral	  force’	 in	  Kabul,	 that	 only	  ‘good
Muslims’	  form	 an	interim	  administration	 in	 Kabul	 and	 that	 representation	be
given	to	all	 30	provinces	 in	the	country.	 The	Taliban's	 insistence	that	only	their
forces	dominate	any	new	government	in	Kabul,	 obliged	the	Rabbani	government
and	the	UN	to	reject	their	demands.
       Masud	 decided	to	deal	with	his	enemies	one	at	a	time.	On	6	March	1995,	he
launched	a	blitzkrieg	  against	the	Hazaras,	sending	 tanks	into	 Kabul's	 southern
suburbs,	smashing	the	Hazaras	and	driving	them	out	of	Kabul.	In	desperation	the
Hazaras	cut	a	deal	with	the	advancing	Taliban,	yielding	 their	heavy	weapons	and
positions	to	 them.	 But	 in	 the	ensuing	 handover	and	 mêlée,	the	 Hazara	leader
Abdul	  Ali	    Mazari	  was	  killed	   while	   in	  Taliban	   custody.	  The	  Hazaras
subsequently	claimed	that	Mazari	was	pushed	out	of	 a	helicopter	to	his	death	by
the	Taliban,	  because	he	 tried	 to	 seize	 a	 rifle	  while	 he	 was	 being	 taken	 to
Kandahar	as	a	prisoner.
       The	 death	of	Mazari,	 accidental	or	intentional,	 was	to	forever	 condemn	the
Taliban	in	the	eyes	of	 the	Afghan	Shias	and	their	main	 patron	Iran.	The	Hazaras
were	never	to	forgive	 the	Taliban	 for	Mazari's	 death	and	took	their	 revenge	two
years	later,	when	 the	Hazaras	massacred	thousands	of	Taliban	 in	 the	 north.	A
bloody	ethnic	and	sectarian	divide,	between	Pashtun	and	Hazara,	Sunni	and	Shia
bubbling	just	below	 the	surface	now	came	into	the	open.
       In	 the	meantime	 Masud	was	not	 going	to	 allow	 the	Taliban	 to	replace	 the
Hazaras	in	southern	Kabul.	 On	 11	March	 1995	 he	launched	another	punishing
attack,	pushing	the	 Taliban	 out	of	 the	city	 after	 bloody	 street	fighting	 that	 left
hundreds	of	 Taliban	 dead.	 It	 was	 the	first	  major	 battle	 that	 the	Taliban	  had
fought	 and	lost.	 Their	  weak	military	  structure	 and	 poor	 tactics	 ensured	their
defeat	at	the	hands	of	Masud's	more	experienced	fighters.
       The	 Taliban	had	won	over	 the	unruly	Pashtun	south	because	the	exhausted,
war-weary	 population	  saw	 them	 as	 saviours	 and	 peacemakers,	if	  not	  as	a
potential	force	to	revive	 Pashtun	power	which	had	been	humiliated	by	 the	Tajiks
and	 Uzbeks.	 Many	  surrenders	 had	 been	 facilitated	   by	 pure	  cash,	 bribing
commanders	to	switch	sides	–	a	tactic	that	the	Taliban	were	to	turn	into	 a	fine	art
form	in	 later	years	and	which	was	sustained	by	the	 growth	in	 their	income	from
the	drugs	trade,	the	transport	business	and	external	aid	from	 Pakistan	and	Saudi
Arabia.	In	their	 advance	they	had	also	captured	massive	quantities	of	small	arms,

59
tanks	and	even	 helicopters	enabling	 them	 to	deploy	 more	 troops.	In	 the	 areas
under	their	rule,	they	 disarmed	the	population,	enforced	 law	and	order,	imposed
strict	Sharia	law	 and	opened	the	roads	to	traffic	 which	 resulted	in	an	immediate
drop	in	 food	 prices.	These	measures	were	all	 extremely	 welcome	 to	 the	long-
suffering	population.	 The	defeat	in	Kabul	 came	as	a	major	blow	 to	the	Taliban's
prestige,	but	not	to	their	determination.
       The	 Taliban	then	turned	their	attention	 to	the	west	in	a	bid	to	capture	Herat.
By	late	February	1995	after	heavy	fighting	 they	captured	Nimroz	 and	Farah,	two
of	the	provinces	 controlled	 by	Ismael	Khan	 and	advanced	on	the	former	 Soviet
airbase	at	Shindand,	south	of	 Herat.	The	 Kabul	 regime	was	 clearly	worried	 by
the	Taliban	 advance	and	 Ismael	Khan's	 failure	  to	hold	 the	 line	 against	them.
Masud's	aircraft	 from	 Kabul	  began	a	bombardment	 of	 the	Taliban	 front	  lines
while	he	airlifted	  2,000	of	his	 battle-hardened	Tajik	fighters	 from	 Kabul	to	 help
defend	Shindand	and	Herat.	With	no	airpower,	 poor	logistical	 support	from	 their
bases	in	Kandahar	 and	a	weak	 command	 structure,	the	 Taliban	 began	to	take
heavy	 casualties	as	 they	 mounted	 assaults	 on	 government	 positions	 around
Shindand.
       By	 the	end	 of	March	 1995,	the	 Taliban	had	been	pushed	out	of	 Shindand.
They	retreated	losing	most	of	 the	territory	 they	had	captured	earlier,	suffering	 at
least	3,000	 casualties.	 Hundreds	 of	 wounded	 were	 left	  in	 the	 desert	 to	 die
because	the	Taliban	  had	no	 medical	 facilities	  at	 the	 front	 and	 their	 lack	  of
logistics	made	it	 impossible	 for	them	 to	provide	 water	and	food	 to	their	 troops.
‘We	 have	 never	 seen	such	 an	 inhospitable	 environment.	  Every	 day	 we	 are
bombed,	10	to	15	times.	 There	is	no	food	 or	water	 and	my	friends	 have	died	of
thirst.	We	 lost	communication	 with	 our	 commanders	and	we	don't	know	 where
our	other	 troops	are.	We	 ran	out	 of	ammunition.	  It	was	 a	great	misery,’	 Saleh
Mohammed,	 a	 wounded	  Taliban	  told	 me,	  as	 he	 was	 transported	 back	  to
Kandahar.2
       The	 Taliban	 had	 now	 been	decisively	 pushed	back	 on	two	 fronts	 by	 the
government	and	 their	 political	  and	military	  leadership	 was	 in	 disarray.	Their
image	as	 potential	 peacemakers	was	 badly	 dented,	 for	 in	 the	 eyes	 of	 many
Afghans	 they	  had	 become	 nothing	  more	 than	  just	 another	 warlord	  party.
President	 Rabbani	 had	  temporarily	  consolidated	  his	 political	   and	 military
position	 around	 Kabul	 and	 Herat.	 By	 May	  1995	 government	 forces	directly
controlled	 six	  provinces	  around	 Kabul	  and	 the	 north,	  while	  Ismael	  Khan
controlled	 the	 three	 western	provinces.	 The	 Taliban's	 initial	  control	  over	 12
provinces	was	reduced	to	eight	after	their	defeats.	But	Herat	continued	to	 remain

60
a	tantalizing	 prize,	 not	 just	for	  the	Taliban,	 but	 for	 the	Pashtun	transport	 and
drugs	mafias	who	were	desperately	keen	to	open	up	the	roads	to	Iran	and	Central
Asia	through	Herat	for	their	 business.
       Few	 Mujaheddin	commanders	had	the	prestige	of	Ismael	Khan	and	few	 had
sacrificed	 more	than	 the	 people	of	 Herat	 during	 the	 war	 against	the	 Soviets.
Ismael	Khan	 was	 an	officer	  in	 the	 Afghan	 army	 when	 the	Russians	 invaded
Afghanistan	 and	 he	 had	 strong	 Islamic	  and	 nationalist	  leanings.	 When	 the
Soviets	occupied	Herat,	they	 viewed	the	Persian-speaking	Heratis	as	docile	 and
unwarlike	 and	the	most	cultured	 of	all	 Afghans.	 The	last	time	 the	Heratis	 were
forced	into	a	fight	 had	been	more	than	a	century	earlier	when	they	had	resisted	a
Persian	invasion	  in	 1837.	 Fearing	 no	 resistance,	 the	 Soviets	 developed	 the
Shindand	airbase	as	their	largest	airbase	in	Afghanistan	and	allowed	the	families
of	their	army	officers	 to	settle	in	Herat.
       But	  on	 15	 March	 1979,	 the	 population	 of	  the	city	  rose	 up	 against	the
Soviets	 in	 an	 unprecedented	 urban	 revolt.	  As	 the	 population	  killed	  Soviet
officers,	 advisers	 and	their	  families,	 Ismael	 Khan	 staged	 a	coup	 in	  the	city
garrison,	killing	 Soviet	 and	communist	Afghan	 officers	 and	distributing	 arms	to
the	 people.	 Hundreds	  of	  Russians	 were	  killed.	  Moscow,	  fearing	  copycat
uprisings	in	 other	 Afghan	 cities,	 sent	300	 tanks	from	  Soviet	 Turkmenistan	 to
crush	the	  revolt	 and	 began	 to	 bomb	 one	 of	  the	 oldest	 cities	 in	  the	 world
indiscriminately.	 Fifteen	 years	 later,	large	 tracts	of	 the	 city	 still	 looked	 like	 a
lunar	landscape	with	rubble	 stretching	to	the	 horizon.	More	 than	20,000	Heratis
were	killed	 during	 the	 next	few	 days.	Ismael	 Khan	escaped	to	the	 countryside
with	 his	new	guerrilla	 army	 and	tens	of	 thousands	of	civilians	 fled	 to	 Iran.	For
the	next	 decade	Ismael	 Khan	 waged	a	 bitter	 guerrilla	 war	 against	 the	Soviet
occupation	and	set	up	an	effective	administration	in	 the	countryside,	winning	 the
respect	of	the	population.	 This	 was	to	prove	 invaluable	to	 him	 when	he	was	to
re-establish	himself	in	Herat	after	the	departure	of	Soviet	troops.
       Herat	 was	 the	 cradle	of	  Afghanistan's	 history	 and	 civilization.	  An	 oasis
town,	 it	 was	 first	  settled	5,000	 years	 ago.	Its	  200	 square	miles	 of	 irrigated
farmland	in	 a	valley	 rimmed	 by	 mountains,	was	considered	to	 have	the	richest
soil	in	 Central	Asia.	 The	 ancient	Greek	historian	 Herodotus	described	Herat	 as
the	breadbasket	of	Central	Asia.	‘The	whole	habitable	world	 had	not	such	a	town
as	Herat,’	 wrote	 the	 Emperor	 Babar	 in	 his	 memoirs.	 The	 British	  likened	 its
beauty	to	England's	home	counties.	‘The	space	between	the	hills	is	one	beautiful
extent	of	little	 fortified	  villages,	gardens,	vineyards	and	cornfields,	 and	this	rich
scene	is	brightened	by	many	small	 streams	of	shining	water	 which	cut	 the	plain

61
in	 all	 directions,’	  the	 British	 adventurer	 and	 spy	 Captain	Connolly	  wrote	 in
1831.3
       For	 centuries	the	city	was	the	crossroads	between	the	competing	Turkic	and
Persian	empires	and	 its	 population	 was	 an	early	 convert	 to	 Islam.	 The	 main
mosque	in	the	city	 centre	dates	back	 to	the	seventh	century	 and	was	rebuilt	 by
the	 Ghorid	  dynasty	 in	  1200.	 In	  medieval	 times	  it	 was	  both	 a	 centre	 for
Christianity,	 under	 the	Nestorian	 Church	and	 a	major	 centre	for	 Sufism	 –	 the
spiritual	and	mystical	 side	of	 Islam.	Followers	 of	the	 Naqshbandi	and	Chishtyia
Sufi	brotherhoods	became	Prime	Ministers	 and	Ministers.	 Herat's	patron	saint	is
Khawaja	 Abdullah	   Ansari	 who	  died	  in	 1088,	  a	 celebrated	 Sufi	  poet	 and
philosopher	who	still	 has	a	large	following	 in	 Afghanistan.	When	 Genghis	Khan
conquered	Herat	in	1222,	he	 spared	only	40	of	 its	160,000	inhabitants.	 But	less
than	two	  centuries	 later	 the	 city	  had	 recovered	to	  reach	its	  pinnacle	 when
Taimur's	son	Shah	Rukh	 and	his	Queen	Gowhar	 Shad	moved	the	capital	 of	the
Timurid	 empire	from	Samarkand	to	Herat	in	1405.
       The	 Timurids	  were	the	 first	 to	 merge	the	 Turkic	 nomadic	 steppe	culture
with	the	refinements	 of	the	settled	Persian	lands,	importing	 artisans	from	Persia,
India	and	Central	Asia	to	 build	hundreds	of	magnificent	 monuments.	Shah	Rukh
and	Gowhar	Shad	turned	 Herat	into	 a	vast	 construction	 site	building	 mosques,
madrassas,	public	 baths,	 libraries	 and	 palaces.	 Herat's	bazaars	produced	 the
finest	 carpets,	jewellery,	  weapons,	 armour	 and	 tiles.	 Bihzad,	 considered	 the
finest	Persian	miniaturist	painter	 of	all	 time	worked	at	the	court.	 ‘In	 Herat	if	you
stretch	out	 your	 feet	you	 are	sure	to	 kick	 a	 poet,’	 said	Ali	  Sher	Nawai,	 Shah
Rukh's	Prime	Minister,	 who	 was	also	an	artist,	 poet	and	writer.4	Nawai,	 who	 is
buried	in	Herat	and	is	the	national	 poet	of	modern	day	Uzbekistan,	is	 considered
the	father	of	 literary	 Turkic	 for	 he	was	the	first	 to	write	 poetry	 in	Turkic	 rather
than	Persian.	The	 Persian	poet	 Jami	was	 also	at	 court	 and	is	 buried	 in	 Herat
while	 Shah	Rukh's	 son	Ulugh	  Beg,	was	 an	astronomer	 whose	observatory	 in
Samarkand	monitored	the	movement	of	stars.	His	calendar	and	tables	of	the	stars
were	published	at	Oxford	University	 in	1665	and	are	still	 astonishingly	accurate.
       In	 1417,	Gowhar	 Shad,	herself	a	builder	 of	 dozens	of	mosques,	completed
the	construction	of	 a	magnificent	complex	 on	the	outskirts	 of	the	city	 consisting
of	a	mosque,	madrassa	and	her	own	tomb.	 The	tomb,	with	 its	 panelled	walls	 of
Persian	blue	tiles	bejewelled	with	 floral	 decorations	and	topped	by	a	ribbed	blue
dome	with	 dazzling	  white	 Koranic	 inscriptions,	 is	 still	  considered	one	 of	 the
finest	examples	of	Islamic	 architecture	anywhere	in	the	world.	 When	Byron	 saw
it	 in	  1937,	  he	 described	 it	  as	 ‘the	  most	  beautiful	  example	 in	  colour	  in

62
architecture	ever	 devised	 by	 man	 to	 the	 glory	 of	  God	 and	himself.’5	  When
Gowhar	Shad	 died	at	 the	 age	of	 80	after	 constructing	 some	 300	buildings	  in
Afghanistan,	Persia	 and	Central	Asia,	 the	 inscription	 on	her	 tomb	 read	simply
‘The	 Bilkis	  of	 the	 Time.’	  Bilkis	  means	 the	Queen	 of	 Sheba.6	Much	 of	  the
complex	was	demolished	by	 the	British	 in	 1885	and	the	Soviets	later	mined	 the
area	to	keep	out	the	Mujaheddin.
       When	 the	Soviets	bombed	Herat	in	1979,	they	inflicted	 more	damage	on	the
city	than	even	the	Mongols	 had	done.	‘Herat	is	 the	most	destroyed	and	the	most
heavily	 mined	 city	 in	 the	 world	  today,	 yet	we	 get	 no	 help	 from	 anywhere,’
Ismael	Khan	told	me	in	 1993.7	Despite	the	devastation	around	him,	Ismael	Khan
had	disarmed	 the	population	 and	 established	an	 effective	 administration	  with
functioning	health	care	and	schools	in	the	three	provinces.
       Short,	 shrewd	and	 with	 an	elfin	 smile	 that	 made	him	 look	 much	younger
than	his	47	years,	Ismael	Khan	 had	45,000	children	studying	 in	 Herat's	schools,
by	 1993	 half	 of	  them	 were	 girls	 –	  75,000	 students	in	  all	 across	 the	three
provinces.	In	 1993	he	took	 me	to	see	the	Atun	 Heirvi	 school	 where	1,500	girls
studied	in	 two	 shifts,	 sitting	 under	the	 open	sky	 as	there	were	 no	classrooms,
desks,	books,	paper	or	 ink	 –	 their	 desire	to	 learn	only	  re-emphasising	Herat's
history	 of	 learning.	 In	 contrast	when	 the	Taliban	 took	 over	 Kandahar,	 the	45
working	 schools	were	closed	down	 and	only	three	 remained.	When	the	Taliban
were	later	to	capture	Herat	they	were	to	 close	down	every	school	in	 the	city	 and
disallow	girls	 from	even	studying	at	home.
       But	 by	 1995	Ismael	 Khan	faced	 immense	problems.	He	 had	disarmed	the
population	 and	created	an	 unpopular	 conscript	army.	 To	 face	 the	Taliban,	 he
needed	to	 rearm	 the	 population	  while	 his	 conscript	  army	 was	 riddled	  with
corruption,	 low	  morale	 and	lack	  of	 resources.	Official	   corruption	 and	 high-
handedness	towards	civilians	   had	become	 rampant	 in	 the	 city	  and	 customs
officials	 charged	 trucks	 passing	through	  Herat	the	 exorbitant	  sum	of	 10,000
Pakistan	rupees	(US$300)	–	a	sure	way	to	make	an	enemy	of	the	transport	mafia.
The	Taliban	were	 well	 informed	 of	the	problems	 he	faced.	‘Ismael	 is	weak,	his
soldiers	 will	  not	 fight	  because	 they	 have	 not	 been	 paid	 and	 he	 is	 widely
discredited	amongst	his	 people	because	of	the	corruption	 in	 his	administration.
He	stands	alone	and	has	to	be	propped	up	by	Masud,’	Mullah	Wakil	 Ahmad	 told
me.8
       Ismael	 Khan	  also	made	 a	serious	 military	  miscalculation.	  Believing	 the
Taliban	were	 on	the	verge	of	 disintegration	 due	to	 their	defeat,	he	launched	 an
ill-prepared	and	badly	 timed	 offensive	against	them.	 With	 a	large	mobile	 force,

63
he	captured	Dilaram	  on	 23	August	 1995	 and	 parts	of	 Helmand	 a	 week	 later
thereby	threatening	 Kandahar.	 But	 his	 forces	 were	overstretched	 in	 a	 hostile
environment	while	 the	Taliban	had	spent	the	summer	rebuilding	their	forces	with
arms,	ammunition	 and	 vehicles	provided	 by	 Pakistan	and	 Saudi	Arabia	 and	 a
new	command	 structure	 created	 with	 the	 help	 of	 ISI	  advisers.	The	 ISI	  also
helped	 broker	 an	 agreement,	 never	 made	 public,	  between	 the	 Taliban	 and
General	Rashid	 Dostum.	 Dostum	 sent	 his	Uzbek	 technicians	 to	 Kandahar	 to
repair	Mig	  fighters	 and	helicopters	 the	Taliban	 had	 captured	a	 year	earlier	 in
Kandahar,	thereby	 creating	 the	 Taliban's	first	  airpower.	 Meanwhile	  Dostum's
own	planes	began	a	bombing	campaign	of	Herat.
       To	 meet	Ismael	 Khan's	threat,	the	Taliban	 quickly	 mobilized	 some	25,000
men,	many	 of	 them	 fresh	 volunteers	 from	 Pakistan.	 Their	 more	 experienced
fighters	were	 deployed	in	 mobile	 columns	 in	Datsun	 pick-ups,	which	  harassed
Ismael's	supply	 lines.	 At	 the	end	 of	 August	 at	Girishk	  the	Taliban	 decisively
ambushed	the	intruders	and	Ismael	Khan	sounded	a	general	retreat.	Within	a	few
days	the	 Taliban	 pushed	back	 his	 forces	to	 Shindand,	 which	 he	 inexplicably
abandoned	on	3	September	1995	without	putting	up	a	fight.	 Then	two	days	later,
with	 his	troops	 in	 a	blind	 panic	as	the	 Taliban	 mobile	 columns	swept	 through
and	around	them,	 Ismael	Khan	 abandoned	Herat	fleeing	 with	 his	 commanders
and	several	hundred	men	to	Iran.	The	next	day	a	pro-government	 mob	in	Kabul,
incensed	at	 the	  loss	 of	 Herat,	  attacked	and	 sacked	 the	 Pakistan	 Embassy,
wounding	  the	  Pakistani	  Ambassador	 as	  government	  soldiers	  looked	  on.
Relations	between	 Kabul	 and	Islamabad	 sunk	to	 an	all-time	  low	 as	President
Rabbani	openly	accused	Pakistan	of	trying	 to	 oust	him	 from	power	 through	the
Taliban.
       The	 Taliban	 now	 controlled	 the	 entire	 west	of	 the	 country,	 the	 sensitive
border	region	  with	 Iran	 and	 for	 the	 first	  time	 ruled	 an	 area	which	  was	not
predominantly	Pashtun.	The	Taliban	 treated	Herat	as	an	occupied	city,	 arresting
hundreds	of	Heratis,	 closing	 down	 all	schools	 and	forcibly	  implementing	 their
social	bans	and	Sharia	law,	 even	more	fiercely	 than	in	 Kandahar.	The	 city	 was
garrisoned	not	by	 local	defectors,	but	 hardcore	Pashtun	Taliban	from	 Kandahar
and	the	administration	  was	handed	over	 to	 Durrani	 Pashtuns,	many	 of	 whom
could	not	 even	speak	Persian	 and	therefore	 were	incapable	 of	communicating
with	the	 local	population.	 Over	the	next	 few	years	not	a	single	 local	Herati	 was
to	be	 inducted	 into	 the	 administration.	 For	 the	 sophisticated	population,	 who
were	now	ruled	by	what	they	 considered	gross,	uneducated	Pashtuns	who	had	no
idea	of	the	past	magnificence	or	history	 of	 the	city,	the	only	 thing	 left	was	to	go

64
to	Jami's	tomb	and	read	his	sad	epitaph.

When	your	face	is	hidden	from	 me,	like	 the	moon	hidden	on	a	dark	night,	I	 shed
stars	of	tears	and	yet	my	night	remains	dark	in	spite	of	all	those	shining	stars.9
	
       The	  fall	 of	  Herat	 was	 also	 the	 beginning	 of	  the	 end	 for	 the	 Rabbani
government.	Bolstered	by	their	 victories,	the	Taliban	 launched	another	attack	on
Kabul	during	 October	 and	November,	hoping	 to	 gain	ground	 before	the	winter
snows	suspended	further	fighting.	 Masud	counterattacked	in	late	November	 and
pushed	them	back,	resulting	in	hundreds	of	dead.	But	the	Taliban	 were	to	persist
and	were	now	 to	 try	 other	 means	of	 conquering	 the	city,	 weakening	 Masud's
front	lines	by	bribes	rather	than	tank	fire.

                                            KABUL	       1996:
                               COMMANDER	             OF	  THE
                                              FAITHFUL

	



Travelling	by	 jeep,	truck	and	horseback	hundreds	of	Afghan	mullahs	began	to
descend	on	Kandahar	in	the	cool	spring	weather	of	1996.	By	20	March	more
than	1,200	Pashtun	religious	leaders	from	south,	west	and	central	Afghanistan
had	arrived	in	the	city.	They	were	housed	and	fed	in	government	offices,	the	old
fort	and	the	covered	bazaar,	which	were	turned	into	enormous	dormitories	by	the
simple	act	of	throwing	hundreds	of	carpets	on	the	floor	so	that	the	mullahs	could
sleep.
       It	was	the	biggest	gathering	of	mullahs	and	ulema	that	had	ever	taken	place
in	modern	Afghan	history.	Significantly	absent	were	local	military	commanders,
traditional	tribal	 and	clan	leaders,	political	figures	 from	 the	war	against	the
Soviets	and	 non-Pashtun	representatives	from	northern	 Afghanistan.	Only
religious	leaders	had	been	summoned	by	Mullah	Omar	to	debate	a	future	plan	of
action,	but	more	importantly	to	legitimize	the	Taliban	leader	as	the	all	powerful
leader	in	the	country.
       The	ten-month	Taliban	siege	of	Kabul	had	failed	to	crack	the	city	and	as
Taliban	casualties	mounted,	there	was	growing	unrest	in	their	ranks.	During	the
long	winter	months,	moderates	in	the	movement	openly	talked	of	the	need	for
negotiations	with	the	Kabul	regime.	Hardliners	wanted	to	continue	the	conquest
of	the	entire	country.	There	were	also	broad	divisions	within	the	Pashtuns.	The
Kandaharis	grouped	around	Omar	wanted	the	war	to	 continue,	while	 those
representing	Pashtun	areas	recently	conquered	by	the	Taliban	wanted	peace	and
an	end	to	the	conflict.
       Everyone	outside	the	country	 also	realised	that	 the	Taliban	 were	at	 a
crossroads.	‘The	Taliban	cannot	take	Kabul	nor	can	Masud	take	Kandahar.	How
will	the	Taliban	evolve	if	they	fail	to	take	Kabul?	Even	if	they	do	manage	to	take
Kabul	how	will	the	rest	of	Afghanistan	accept	their	type	of	Islamic	system?’	the
UN	mediator	Mehmoud	Mestiri	told	me.1	For	more	than	two	weeks	the	Shura

67
continued	with	 meetings	lasting	all	 day	and	all	night.	 Separate	Shuras	discussed
issues	such	as	the	political	 and	military	  future,	 how	 best	to	impose	Sharia	 law
and	the	future	of	girls’	 education	in	 Taliban-held	areas.	The	discussions	were	all
held	in	  extreme	secrecy	 and	foreigners	  were	banned	 from	 Kandahar	 for	 the
duration.	However	Pakistani	 officials	 were	there	to	monitor	 the	Shura,	including
the	Pakistani	Ambassador	to	Kabul	Qazi	 Humayun	and	several	ISI	 officers	such
as	Colonel	Imam,	Pakistan's	Consul	General	in	Herat.
       To	  patch	 over	 their	  differences,	 the	 core	 group	 of	  Kandaharis	 around
Mullah	   Omar	  nominated	   him	   to	  become	  the	  ‘Amirul	     Momineen’	   or
‘Commander	 of	 the	 Faithful’,	  an	 Islamic	 title	 that	 made	 him	 the	 undisputed
leader	of	 the	 jihad	 and	 the	Emir	  of	 Afghanistan.	 (The	 Taliban	 were	 later	 to
rename	the	country	  as	the	 Emirate	 of	 Afghanistan).	 On	 4	 April	  1996,	 Omar
appeared	on	the	roof	of	a	building	in	 the	centre	of	the	city,	 wrapped	in	the	Cloak
of	the	Prophet	 Mohammed,	which	 had	been	taken	out	 of	 its	shrine	for	 the	first
time	in	 60	years.	As	 Omar	wrapped	and	unwrapped	the	 Cloak	around	his	 body
and	 allowed	 it	  to	 flap	  in	 the	  wind,	 he	 was	 rapturously	  applauded	 by	 the
assembled	throng	of	 mullahs	 in	 the	courtyard	 below,	 as	they	shouted	 ‘Amirul
Momineen.’
       This	 oath	of	 allegiance	 or	‘baiat’	  was	a	procedure	similar	 to	 when	Caliph
Omar	was	 confirmed	 as	leader	 of	 the	Muslim	  community	 in	 Arabia	 after	 the
death	of	the	Prophet	Mohammed.	It	was	a	political	 masterstroke,	for	by	 cloaking
himself	with	  the	Prophet's	mantle,	Mullah	  Omar	had	assumed	the	right	 to	 lead
not	just	all	 Afghans,	 but	all	 Muslims.	 The	 meeting	ended	with	 a	declaration	 of
jihad	against	the	Rabbani	regime.	The	Taliban	 vowed	not	to	 open	talks	with	any
of	their	 adversaries	and	declared	that	a	final	 decision	on	allowing	  women	to	be
educated	could	 only	 be	 tackled	 ‘when	 there	 was	a	 legitimate	 government	 in
Afghanistan’.	The	hard-liners	 and	Mullah	Omar	had	won.2
       But	 for	 many	 Afghans	 and	Muslims	 elsewhere	it	 was	a	serious	 affront	 to
propriety	that	a	poor	village	 mullah	with	 no	scholarly	learning,	 no	tribal	pedigree
or	connections	to	the	Prophet's	family	 should	presume	so	much.	No	Afghan	 had
adopted	the	title	  since	1834,	 when	King	  Dost	Mohammed	 Khan	 assumed	the
title	 before	he	declared	jihad	 against	the	 Sikh	 kingdom	 in	Peshawar.	But	 Dost
Mohammed	was	fighting	  foreigners,	while	 Omar	had	declared	jihad	 against	his
own	people.	Moreover,	 there	was	no	sanction	for	such	a	title	 in	Islam,	 unless	all
of	the	country's	 ulema	had	bestowed	it	 upon	a	leader.	The	 Taliban	insisted	 that
their	meeting	constituted	 the	Koranic	 requirement	of	 ‘ahl	 al-hal	o	aqd’,	 literally
‘the	 people	who	 can	 loose	 and	bind’	  or	 those	empowered	 to	 take	legitimate

68
decisions	on	behalf	of	the	Islamic	community.
       For	 Omar	the	 title	 gave	him	badly	 needed	legitimacy	 and	a	new	 mystique
amongst	the	Pashtuns	that	no	other	Mujaheddin	 leader	 had	acquired	during	 the
war.	It	would	 allow	him	 to	distance	himself	still	 further	 from	day-to-day	 politics,
give	him	an	additional	 excuse	not	to	meet	foreign	diplomats	and	allow	 him	to	 be
more	inflexible	  in	 either	 broadening	 the	base	of	 the	 Taliban	 leadership	 or	 in
talking	 to	the	 opposition.	 Omar	 could	now	 always	 retreat	behind	 his	 title	 and
decline	to	meet	opposition	leaders	on	an	equal	footing.
       But	 the	 ulema	meeting	 had	deliberately	 not	come	to	 any	decisions	 on	the
much	more	sensitive	questions	on	 how	the	Taliban	 planned	to	rule	 Afghanistan
and	 what	 if	  anything	  they	 planned	 for	  the	 country's	  economic	 and	 social
development.	Such	 questions	 were	 to	 remain	 permanently	 unanswered,	even
after	they	captured	Kabul.	‘We	 have	not	gone	public	yet	on	our	structure	because
we	are	 not	 strong	 enough	 to	 decide	who	 will	   be	the	 Prime	 Minister	  or	 the
President,’	said	 Mullah	 Wakil,	  the	 aide	to	 Omar.	 ‘The	 Sharia	does	not	 allow
politics	 or	 political	  parties.	 That	 is	 why	  we	 give	 no	 salaries	 to	 officials	  or
soldiers,	just	 food,	clothes,	 shoes	and	weapons.	We	want	 to	live	 a	life	 like	 the
Prophet	lived	 1,400	 years	ago	and	jihad	 is	 our	 right.	 We	want	 to	 recreate	the
time	of	 the	Prophet	and	we	are	only	 carrying	 out	what	 the	Afghan	 people	have
wanted	for	 the	 past	14	 years,’	 he	added.3	Another	 Taliban	 leader	put	 it	 even
more	succinctly.	  ‘We	 can	 love	 our	 enemies	but	 only	 after	 we	 have	defeated
them.’
       Only	  a	day	 earlier	 Taliban	 emissaries	had	told	 Mestiri	  in	 Islamabad	that
they	were	ready	 to	talk	 to	President	Rabbani.4	‘If	  the	Taliban	 are	ready	to	talk
and	President	 Rabbani	 is	 ready	 to	 talk,	 then	 this	 is	  really	 something,’	  said
Mestiri	 hopefully.	 The	final	 result	of	 the	ulema	meeting	was	a	blow	 that	neither
Mestiri	nor	 the	UN	peace	effort	was	to	recover	from	and	in	May	 Mestiri	 resigned
from	his	job.
       The	  ulema	 meeting	 had	 also	 been	 prompted	 by	  the	 regime's	 growing
political	 successes	at	wooing	 other	opposition	 leaders	and	 President	Rabbani's
increasing	 international	  standing.	  Kabul's	  military	   successes	at	 seeing	 off
Hikmetyar,	 the	Hazaras	and	the	Taliban	attack	had	finally	 persuaded	the	regime
that	this	was	an	opportune	moment	to	try	and	gain	greater	political	 acceptability,
by	broadening	 the	 base	of	 their	 support.	 President	Rabbani	 began	talks	 with
other	warlords,	 holding	  out	 the	carrot	 that	 he	 was	prepared	 to	set	 up	 a	new
government	which	could	 include	them.	In	January	and	February	1996,	Rabbani's
emissary	Dr	Abdur	Rehman	met	separately	with	Gulbuddin	 Hikmetyar	 at	Sarobi,

69
with	  General	 Rashid	  Dostum	  in	  Mazar-e-Sharif	  and	  the	 Hizb-e-Wahadat
leadership	in	 Bamiyan.	  In	 February	 all	 the	 opposition	 groups	 except	for	  the
Taliban	agreed	to	set	up	a	ten-man	council	 to	negotiate	peace	terms	with	Kabul,
even	as	the	 Taliban	 continued	to	 demand	the	 surrender	of	 the	regime.	 A	 few
weeks	later	  the	 council	 of	  the	 Hizb-e-Islami	  gave	 Hikmetyar	  the	power	  to
negotiate	a	power-sharing	agreement	with	Rabbani.
       Pakistan	 was	 worried	 by	 Rabbani's	 successes	and	attempted	to	 woo	 the
same	warlords	 to	 join	 the	 Taliban	 and	 form	 an	 anti-Kabul	  alliance.	 The	 ISI
summoned	Hikmetyar,	 Dostum,	the	 Pashtun	leaders	of	the	Jalalabad	Shura	and
some	Hizb-e-Wahadat	 chiefs	 to	 Islamabad	to	 persuade	them	 to	 ally	 with	  the
Taliban.	 These	warlords	  met	with	  President	 Farooq	 Leghari	 and	 army	 chief
General	Jehangir	Karamat	as	negotiations	 continued	for	 a	week	 between	7	and
13	February.	Pakistan	proposed	a	political	  alliance	and	in	 private	 a	joint	 attack
on	Kabul	with	 the	Taliban	attacking	from	 the	south,	Hikmetyar	from	 the	east	and
Dostum	from	 the	north.5	To	 sweeten	the	Taliban,	Babar	offered	 to	spend	US$3
million	 to	repair	the	road	across	southern	Afghanistan	from	Chaman	to	Torgundi
on	the	Turkmenistan	 border.	But	 the	Taliban	 refused	to	turn	 up	to	the	 meeting,
spurning	their	 Pakistani	mentors	yet	 again,	despite	personal	appeals	by	Interior
Minister	 Naseerullah	 Babar,	 the	 JUI	 chief	  Fazlur	 Rehman	and	 the	 ISI.	 The
Taliban	 declined	 to	have	 anything	 to	 do	 with	 the	 other	 warlords	 whom	 they
condemned	as	communist	infidels.
       Islamabad's	 failure	  to	 create	 a	 united	 front	 against	 Kabul,	  emboldened
Rabbani	further.	In	 early	 March,	along	 with	 a	60-man	delegation,	 he	set	off	 on
an	extensive	tour	of	 Iran,	Turkmenistan,	 Uzbekistan	and	Tajikistan	 to	 lobby	for
international	 support	 and	increased	 military	  aid.	Iran,	  Russia	and	 India,	 who
backed	the	Kabul	regime,	 calculated	that	the	conflict	  had	now	entered	a	crucial
stage	as	another	battle	for	Kabul	could	increase	political	instability	 and	influence
the	spread	of	Islamic	 fundamentalism	in	 Central	Asia.	 Iran	was	incensed	by	the
fall	of	 Herat	to	a	Pashtun	force	that	was	vehemently	anti-Shia	and	was	backed	by
its	 regional	 rivals	  Pakistan	 and	Saudi	 Arabia.	  Russia	 considered	 the	Kabul
regime	as	more	 moderate	and	pliant	  than	the	Taliban,	 as	 it	 worried	 about	the
security	of	the	Central	Asian	 Republics.	Moscow	also	wanted	an	end	to	the	four-
year-old	 civil	  war	 in	 Tajikistan	 between	 the	neo-communist	 government	 and
Islamic	rebels,	 which	was	 being	fuelled	 from	 Afghanistan.	 India	 backed	Kabul
simply	because	of	Pakistani	support	to	the	Taliban.
       All	  these	countries	stepped	up	military	aid	to	 the	regime	forces.	Russia	sent
technical	help	to	upgrade	Bagram	 airport	facilities	 for	 the	regime	while	 Russian

70
transport	planes	from	  Russia,	Tajikistan	 and	 Ukraine	 delivered	 Russian	arms,
ammunition	 and	fuel	 to	 Kabul.	 Iran	 developed	 an	air	 bridge	 from	 Meshad	 in
eastern	Iran	to	 Bagram,	 where	it	 flew	  in	 arms	supplies.	Pakistani	 intelligence
reported	that	on	a	single	day,	13	 Iranian	flights	 landed	at	Bagram	with	 supplies.
The	CIA	 suspected	that	Afghan	Shia	allies	 of	the	Rabbani	 regime	had	sold	Iran
five	Stinger	 anti-aircraft	 missiles	 for	US$1	 million	 each.	(The	 US	provided	 the
Mujaheddin	 with	 some	 900	Stingers	 in	 1986-87	 and	after	 1992	 the	CIA	  had
launched	a	clandestine	but	 unsuccessful	buy-back	operation	 to	 try	and	 retrieve
those	Stingers	 not	 utilised.)6	 Iran	  had	 also	set	 up	 five	  training	  camps	near
Meshad	for	some	5,000	fighters	led	 by	the	former	 Herat	Governor	Ismael	Khan.
Iran's	aid	to	the	regime	was	significant	 because	Tehran	had	to	swallow	 its	anger
with	 Masud	over	the	 slaughter	of	the	 Shia	Hazaras	in	Kabul	 the	previous	 year.
India	 meanwhile	 helped	 refurbish	 Ariana	 –	 the	 Afghan	  national	 airline	 now
based	in	New	 Delhi	 –	to	 provide	the	 regime	with	 a	reliable	 arms	carrier.	 India
also	provided	aircraft	parts,	new	ground	radars	and	money.
       In	 turn,	Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	 stepped	up	arms	supplies	to	the	Taliban.
Pakistan	 provided	 a	 new	  telephone	 and	 wireless	 network	  for	  the	 Taliban,
refurbished	Kandahar	airport	and	helped	out	 with	spare	parts	and	armaments	for
the	Taliban's	 airforce,	while	  continuing	 to	provide	 food,	 fuel	 and	ammunition,
including	 rockets.	The	Saudis	provided	 fuel,	 money	and	hundreds	of	new	 pick-
ups	to	the	Taliban.	 Much	 of	 this	aid	 was	flown	 into	 Kandahar	airport	 from	 the
Gulf	port	city	 of	Dubai.
       The	 extent	of	 outside	interference	 worried	 the	Americans:	 after	a	 lapse	of
four	years	they	were	once	again	beginning	to	take	an	interest	in	 trying	to	 resolve
the	Afghan	 conflict.	 In	 early	 March,	 Congressman	Hank	Brown,	 a	 member	of
the	Senate	Subcommittee	on	Foreign	Relations	for	 South	Asia,	 became	the	first
American	 elected	representative	 in	 six	 years	 to	 visit	 Kabul	 and	 other	 power
centres.	He	hoped	to	call	a	meeting	of	all	the	Afghan	factions	in	 Washington.7
       The	 US	Assistant	Secretary	of	State	for	South	Asia	Robin	 Raphel	arrived	in
Islamabad	to	review	US	 policy	 towards	Afghanistan.	 Starting	on	19	April	  1996,
Raphel	visited	 the	three	power	 centres	of	Kabul,	 Kandahar	and	Mazar-e-Sharif
and	later	three	Central	Asian	 capitals.	‘We	 do	not	 see	ourselves	inserting	in	the
middle	of	 Afghan	 affairs,	 but	we	 consider	ourselves	as	a	friend	 of	Afghanistan
which	is	why	 I	am	 here	to	urge	the	Afghans	themselves	to	get	together	and	talk.
We	 are	also	 concerned	 that	 economic	 opportunities	  here	will	  be	 missed,	 if
political	  stability	  cannot	 be	 restored,’	  said	 Raphel	 in	  Kabul.8	 Raphel	  was
referring	to	a	proposed	gas	pipeline	to	be	built	 by	the	American	 oil	 giant	Unocal

71
to	carry	gas	from	 Turkmenistan	 across	Afghanistan	to	Pakistan.	The	 US	waited
to	make	 the	pipeline	 acceptable	 to	all	 Afghan	  factions	 and	urged	 Pakistan	to
make	up	with	the	Rabbani	regime	and	bring	 the	Taliban	and	the	Rabbani	regime
to	the	peace	table.
       The	 US	 moved	on	 other	fronts.	 During	 a	UN	 Security	 Council	 debate	on
Afghanistan	on	 10	April	  1996,	the	 first	 to	be	 held	in	 six	 years,	it	 proposed	an
international	arms	embargo	on	Afghanistan.	Raphel	wanted	to	 use	this	as	a	lever
to	persuade	all	 the	involved	  regional	 countries	to	 agree	to	 non-interference	in
Afghanistan,	 while	 at	 the	same	time	  lending	 greater	weight	 to	 UN	 efforts	  to
convene	a	conference	of	all	the	Afghan	factions.9
       The	 Clinton	 administration	 was	clearly	sympathetic	 to	the	Taliban,	 as	they
were	in	  line	 with	  Washington's	 anti-Iran	 policy	  and	 were	 important	 for	  the
success	of	any	southern	pipeline	 from	 Central	Asia	 that	would	 avoid	 Iran.	 The
US	Congress	 had	authorised	 a	 covert	 US$20	 million	  budget	 for	 the	 CIA	  to
destabilize	Iran,	  and	Tehran	 had	 accused	Washington	 of	 funnelling	  some	 of
these	funds	to	 the	Taliban	 –	a	 charge	that	was	 always	denied	 by	Washington.
Bhutto	sent	several	emissaries	to	Washington	 to	urge	 the	US	to	 intervene	more
publicly	 on	the	side	of	Pakistan	and	the	Taliban,	but	despite	a	common	antipathy
to	Iran,	  Washington	 resisted,	refusing	 to	 take	 sides	in	  the	civil	  war.	 Raphel
vehemently	denied	that	 the	US	was	 aiding	the	 Taliban.	‘We	 do	 not	favour	 one
faction	over	 another	nor	 do	we	give	 any	group	 or	individual	  support,’	 she	told
me.
       Moreover	 the	US	remained	sceptical	 that	the	Taliban	would	 conquer	Kabul
in	 the	  near	 future.	 Raphel	  described	 the	 Taliban	  as	 highly	  fractionalized,
inexperienced,	lacking	 strong	leadership	and	inept	 at	administration	 while	 their
obstinacy	 had	 alienated	  other	 factions.	  ‘These	 weaknesses	 combined	 with
Masud's	growing	 strength,	appear	to	be	shifting	 the	balance	against	the	Taliban
somewhat,	and	 will	  prevent	 them	from	  achieving	 their	 stated	 goal	of	  taking
Kabul.	While	 the	Taliban	 appears	to	have	reached	the	limit	 of	 its	expansion,	its
position	in	the	Pashtun	south	is	solid,’	she	said.10
       Washington	 also	 courted	the	 other	 warlords.	 Several	visited	 Washington,
starting	with	 General	Dostum	 who	met	US	 officials	 in	 Washington	on	 11	April
1996.	Afghan	leaders	or	their	 representatives	from	all	factions	 participated	in	 an
unprecedented	Congressional	 hearing	 in	  Washington	 held	 by	  Senator	Hank
Brown	between	25	and	27	June.	However	in	an	American	 election	year	and	with
little	  enthusiasm	for	  renewed	 involvement	  in	 the	 quagmire	 of	  Afghanistan,
Washington's	aims	could	only	 be	limited,	 even	though	the	 arms	and	drugs	trade

72
proliferating	 inside	Afghanistan	worried	 Washington.
       US	 reluctance	 to	 support	 the	 Taliban	 was	 also	influenced	  by	 Pakistan's
failure	in	creating	 an	anti-Rabbani	alliance.	This	proved	even	more	embarrassing
for	 Islamabad	when,	in	 May,	 1,000	 of	 Hikmetyar's	 troops	arrived	 in	 Kabul	 to
support	the	government	and	defend	the	front	line	against	the	Taliban.	On	26	June
1996	Hikmetyar	 himself	 entered	Kabul	for	 the	first	 time	 in	15	years,	to	 take	up
the	post	of	Prime	 Minister	 offered	 by	the	regime,	 while	 his	party	accepted	nine
other	 cabinet	posts	 in	 the	 government.	 In	  retaliation,	 on	 the	 same	 day,	 the
Taliban	 launched	a	massive	 rocket	 attack	on	 Kabul	 in	 which	 61	 people	were
killed	and	over	100	injured.
       Rabbani	followed	  up	his	political	 breakthrough	with	 Hikmetyar	 with	 a	visit
to	Jalalabad	 where	 he	attempted	 to	 persuade	the	Jalalabad	 Shura	to	 join	  his
government.	He	said	he	was	willing	 to	step	down	in	favour	 of	any	Afghan	leader
and	proposed	an	all-party	 conference	in	 Jalalabad	to	elect	a	 new	head	of	 state.
By	 August	 Dostum	 had	 also	 agreed	to	 a	 truce	 and	 he	reopened	 the	Salang
Highway	 which	connected	Kabul	 with	 the	north	of	 the	country	for	 the	first	 time
in	over	a	year.	Rabbani's	agreements	had	finally	 got	his	‘intra-Afghan	  dialogue’
off	  the	 ground.	  ‘This	  alliance	  can	 be	  consolidated	 by	  bringing	   in	 more
opposition	figures	 to	create	a	peace	axis	and	I	call	 on	others	to	 join	 the	process
so	that	a	formula	 for	 an	interim	 government	can	be	found,’	 Rabbani	told	 me	in
Kabul.11	It	 was	 a	significant	  achievement,	 which	 infuriated	 the	 Taliban	 who
realized	 that	 they	 would	  have	 to	 move	 quickly	   against	Rabbani	 before	  he
consolidated	these	alliances.
       Camped	  outside	  the	 capital,	  the	  Taliban	  had	  been	 rocketing	  Kabul
mercilessly	 throughout	 the	 year.	 In	 April	  1996	 alone,	 the	Taliban	  fired	 866
rockets,	killing	 180	civilians,	 injuring	  550	and	destroying	large	tracts	of	 the	city
–	a	repetition	 of	 Hikmetyar's	 attacks	in	 1993–95.	In	 July	1996	 Taliban	 rockets
fell	 close	 to	 the	newly	  appointed	UN	  mediator	 for	 Afghanistan,	 the	 German
diplomat	 Norbert	 Holl	 who	 was	 visiting	 Kabul.	 Holl	  was	furious.	 ‘This	  is	no
way	to	treat	a	peace	emissary,	by	shooting	at	him.	If	 you	 receive	a	guest	in	your
house	you	don't	start	spitting	 at	him.	 It	 demonstrates	a	sort	of	 contempt	for	 my
mission,’	he	told	the	Taliban.12
       The	 Taliban's	 rocket	attacks	 were	punctuated	by	 frequent	 ground	assaults
against	Masud's	front	lines	south	and	west	of	the	city.	At	 the	end	of	May,	 I	stood
on	a	 rain-swept	 hill	 with	  Masud's	troops	 outside	Kabul	  and	watched	 through
binoculars	as	dozens	of	Taliban	in	pick-ups	 tried	to	punch	through	Masud's	lines
along	a	road	in	the	valley	below	under	the	cover	of	 a	Taliban	artillery	 barrage.	In

73
return	 Masud's	 Russian-made	 D-30	  howitzers	 pounded	  the	 hidden	 Taliban
artillery.	 The	thud	of	shells	shook	the	mountains,	 deafening	the	ears	and	making
me	sway	at	the	knees.	The	gunners	were	stone-deaf	due	to	the	constant	shelling
and	the	lack	of	ear	protectors.
       Behind	 Masud's	 lines,	lorry-loads	 of	 fresh	 troops	and	ammunition	 ground
their	way	 up	the	hill	  through	the	 mud	to	 replenish	supplies.	‘The	 Taliban	 have
enormous	supplies	 of	 ammunition	 and	they	 shoot	 off	 thousands	of	 shells	 but
their	gunners	are	very	 inaccurate.	However	 they	 are	making	better	 use	of	their
tanks	and	pick-ups	 than	a	year	ago,’	 said	a	general	from	 Masud's	 army.	‘Their
tactics	are	still	 poor,	 relying	 more	on	frontal	 assaults	and	there	seems	to	be	no
effective	chain	of	 command,’	 he	added.	The	Taliban	were	unable	to	concentrate
enough	firepower	and	manpower	on	one	front	to	 achieve	a	breakthrough	into	the
city	and	Masud	was	constantly	 breaking	up	their	 formations.	 Although	 he	could
hold	the	line	 around	Kabul,	 his	 forces,	estimated	at	just	 25,000	men,	could	 not
extend	it	and	carry	out	offensives	to	push	the	Taliban	further	south.
       The	 Taliban's	 stubbornness	in	  refusing	 to	 cut	 deals	with	  other	warlords
frustrated	the	 Pakistanis,	but	 finally	  it	 appeared	to	 pay	 off	 when	 the	 Taliban
persuaded	Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	to	back	another	major	bid	to	capture	Kabul
before	the	 winter.	 The	 Saudi	 Intelligence	 chief	 Prince	 Turki	 al	 Faisal	 visited
Islamabad	and	Kandahar	in	July	1996	 to	discuss	with	the	ISI	 a	new	plan	 to	take
Kabul,	and	both	countries	stepped	up	supplies	to	the	Taliban.	Within	 two	months
of	Turki's	 visit,	the	Taliban	were	on	the	move	–	not	 against	Kabul	but	the	eastern
city	of	 Jalalabad.	Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	 helped	engineer	 the	surrender	and
eventual	flight	 of	 the	head	of	 the	Jalalabad	Shura,	Haji	 Abdul	 Qadeer.	He	 was
given	a	large	bribe,	 reported	by	 some	Afghans	to	 be	US$10	million	  in	cash,	as
well	 as	guarantees	that	his	assets	and	bank	accounts	in	 Pakistan	would	 not	 be
frozen.13
       The	 Taliban	 launched	their	 surprise	 offensive	 on	Jalalabad	on	 25	August
1996.	As	the	main	 Taliban	force	 moved	up	on	 the	city	 from	the	south,	 Pakistan
allowed	hundreds	 of	armed	 Taliban	 supporters	from	 Afghan	 refugee	camps	in
Pakistan	to	cross	 the	border	 and	move	 on	Jalalabad	from	 the	 east.	There	was
panic	in	 Jalalabad	and	the	Shura	fell	 apart.	Haji	 Qadeer	fled	 to	 Pakistan	on	10
September	and	his	 replacement	 Acting	 Governor	 Mehmoud	 was	 killed	  along
with	 six	 bodyguards	a	day	 later,	while	  also	trying	 to	 escape	to	Pakistan.	That
same	evening	a	Taliban	mobile	 column	of	 pick-ups	led	by	 Mullah	 Borjan	 drove
into	Jalalabad	after	a	brief	firefight	 in	which	 some	70	people	were	killed.
       Within	   the	 next	 few	  days	 mobile	 Taliban	  columns	 captured	 the	 three

74
eastern	provinces	of	 Nangarhar,	 Laghman	 and	Kunar	 and	 on	the	 night	 of	 24
September	1996	they	moved	on	Sarobi,	45	miles	from	 Kabul	and	the	gateway	to
the	capital.	Their	 lightning	 attack,	which	 came	from	 several	directions,	took	 the
government's	troops	by	 total	 surprise	and	they	 fled	 back	to	Kabul.	 The	 capital
was	now	wide	open	from	 the	east	for	the	first	time.	 The	Taliban	did	 not	pause	to
regroup,	but	 instead	pursued	Sarobi's	 defenders	back	 to	Kabul.	 Other	 Taliban
columns	moved	 on	 Kabul	 from	 the	 south,	while	  another	column	 drove	 north
from	Sarobi	to	capture	Bagram	airport	cutting	 off	Masud's	only	 air	link.
       The	 speed	 of	 their	 offensive	  stunned	the	 government.	 Taliban	  columns
swept	into	 Kabul	 on	the	evening	 of	26	 September	1996,	just	 a	few	 hours	after
Masud	had	ordered	a	general	withdrawal	to	evacuate	the	city.	Small	 units	stayed
behind	to	 delay	 the	 Taliban	 advance	and	blow	  up	 ammunition	 dumps,	 while
Masud	escaped	northwards	with	the	bulk	of	his	armour	and	artillery.	 Masud	took
the	decision	to	abandon	the	city	 without	 a	fight	 knowing	 he	could	 not	defend	it
from	attacks	coming	from	 all	four	 points	of	the	compass.	Nor	did	he	want	to	lose
the	support	 of	 Kabul's	 population	  by	 fighting	  for	 the	 city	 and	 causing	more
bloodshed.	 The	  Taliban	  victory	  was	  complete.	  ‘No	  Afghan	  force,	  either
government	or	opposition,	 had	ever	carried	out	 such	a	swift	 and	complex	series
of	operations	 over	such	 a	wide	 operation	area.	This	 was	mobile	 warfare	 at	its
most	effective.’14
       The	  Taliban's	  first	  and	  bloodiest	  act	 was	  to	 hang	  former	  President
Najibullah,	  then	 aged	 50,	 who	 had	 ruled	  Afghanistan	 from	  1986	 to	 1992.
Najibullah	 had	 been	staying	 in	 a	 UN	 diplomatic	  compound	 in	 central	Kabul
since	1992,	when	 a	UN	 peace	plan	to	 set	up	an	interim	 government	 fell	 apart.
Just	before	the	 Mujaheddin	 were	 to	 capture	Kabul,	 Najibullah	  was	due	 to	 be
taken	out	of	 Kabul	by	 the	UN	 mediator	Benon	 Sevan,	but	they	were	stopped	at
the	last	moment.	 All	 the	warring	 Afghan	 factions	 had	respected	the	diplomatic
immunity	 of	 the	 UN	 compound.	 Najibullah's	 wife	 Fatana	and	 three	daughters
had	lived	in	exile	in	 New	Delhi	 since	1992.
       Blunders	  by	 the	UN	  were	 partly	 responsible	 for	 his	 death.	 On	 the	day
Sarobi	fell,	 Najibullah	 had	sent	a	message	to	the	UN	headquarters	in	Islamabad
asking	 Norbet	  Holl	   to	  arrange	 the	  evacuation	 of	  himself	   and	 his	  three
companions	 –	 his	  brother,	 Shahpur	  Ahmadzai,	 his	  personal	 secretary	 and
bodyguard.	But	 there	were	 no	UN	 officials	  in	 Kabul	 to	take	 responsibility	 for
Najibullah.	 Only	Masud	offered	 him	a	lift	 out	of	 the	city.	On	 the	afternoon	of	26
September	1996,	Masud	 sent	one	 of	 his	 senior	Generals	to	 ask	 Najibullah	 to
leave	with	 the	retreating	government	 troops,	promising	 him	 safe	passage	to	the

75
north,	but	 Najibullah	  refused.	A	 proud	 and	stubborn	 man,	he	 probably	 feared
that	if	 he	fled	 with	 the	Tajiks,	 he	would	 be	for	 ever	damned	in	 the	eyes	of	 his
fellow	Pashtuns.15
       There	 were	only	 three	frightened	 Afghan	 guards	employed	 by	 the	UN	 on
duty	inside	the	compound	and	they	fled	 as	they	heard	the	guns	of	the	Taliban	on
the	outskirts	 of	 the	city.	 Najibullah	  sent	a	last	 wireless	message	to	 the	UN	 in
Islamabad	in	the	early	evening,	again	asking	for	help.	But	by	 then	it	was	too	late.
A	special	Taliban	 unit	of	 five	men	designated	for	the	task	and	believed	to	 be	led
by	Mullah	  Abdul	  Razaq,	the	 Governor	 of	 Herat	 and	now	 commander	 of	 the
forces	designated	to	capture	Kabul,	came	for	Najibullah	 at	about	1.00	a.m.,	even
before	the	Taliban	 had	entered	central	Kabul.	 Razaq	later	 admitted	that	 he	had
ordered	Najibullah's	murder.16
       The	 Taliban	  walked	 up	 to	 Najibullah's	  room,	 beat	him	  and	his	 brother
senseless	and	then	bundled	them	into	a	pick-up	and	drove	 them	to	the	darkened
Presidential	Palace.	There	they	castrated	Najibullah,	 dragged	his	body	 behind	a
jeep	for	 several	rounds	of	 the	Palace	and	then	 shot	him	 dead.	His	brother	 was
similarly	 tortured	and	 then	throttled	 to	death.	The	Taliban	 hanged	the	two	 dead
men	from	  a	concrete	 traffic	 control	  post	just	 outside	 the	 Palace,	only	 a	 few
blocks	from	the	UN	 compound.
       At	  dawn	curious	 Kabulis	 came	to	view	 the	 two	 bloated,	beaten	bodies	as
they	hung	from	steel	wire	 nooses	around	their	necks.	Unlit	 cigarettes	were	stuck
between	their	fingers	 and	Afghani	  notes	stuffed	into	 their	 pockets	–	 to	convey
the	 Taliban	 message	 of	 debauchery	 and	 corruption.	  Najibullah's	  two	  other
companions	had	escaped	from	the	compound,	but	 they	were	 later	caught	trying
to	flee	the	city	and	were	also	tortured	and	hanged.
       Najibullah's	  execution	was	the	 first	 symbolic,	 brutal	 act	by	 the	Taliban	 in
Kabul.	  It	  was	  a	 premeditated,	  targeted	 killing	   designed	  to	 terrorize	   the
population.	 Mullah	  Rabbani,	 the	 newly	 appointed	 head	 of	 the	 Kabul	  Shura
proclaimed	that	 Najibullah	  was	a	 communist	 and	a	murderer	 and	that	 he	had
been	sentenced	to	death	 by	 the	Taliban.	 That	 was	 true,	but	 the	 mutilation	 of
Najibullah's	 body	was	beyond	the	pale	of	 any	Islamic	 injunction,	 while	 the	lack
of	a	fair	trial	 and	the	public	 display	of	 the	bodies	revolted	many	Kabulis.	 People
were	further	repulsed	when	the	Taliban	banned	an	Islamic	funeral	for	Najibullah,
even	though	 funeral	  prayers	were	 said	 for	 him	  the	 next	 day	 in	 Quetta	 and
Peshawar	 where	 he	  was	  remembered	 by	  Pakistan's	  Pashtun	 nationalists.
Eventually	the	bodies	were	taken	down	and	handed	over	to	the	ICRC,	who	drove
them	to	Gardez,	Najibullah's	 birthplace	 in	Paktia	 province	where	he	was	 buried

76
by	his	Ahmadzai	tribesmen.
       There	   was	  widespread	  international	   condemnation	   of	   the	  murder,
particularly	 from	the	Muslim	 world.	 The	Taliban	 had	humiliated	the	UN	 and	the
international	  community	  and	 embarrassed	 their	  allies,	 Pakistan	  and	 Saudi
Arabia.	The	 UN	finally	  issued	a	statement.	‘The	killing	  of	 the	former	 President
without	 any	legitimate	 judicial	 procedure	not	 only	 constitutes	a	grave	violation
of	the	immunity	  UN	 premises	enjoy,	but	 also	further	 jeopardizes	all	 the	efforts
which	 are	being	made	to	 secure	a	peaceful	settlement	 of	 the	Afghan	 conflict.’
The	Taliban	  were	 not	 deterred	and	 they	 issued	death	 sentences	on	 Dostum,
Rabbani	and	Masud.
       Within	  24	hours	of	 taking	Kabul,	 the	Taliban	 imposed	the	strictest	 Islamic
system	in	 place	anywhere	 in	 the	world.	  All	  women	were	 banned	from	 work,
even	 though	  one	 quarter	  of	  Kabul's	  civil	   service,	  the	 entire	  elementary
educational	system	and	much	 of	 the	health	system	were	 run	by	 women.	 Girls‘
schools	and	 colleges	 were	 closed	 down	 affecting	  more	 than	 70,000	 female
students	and	a	strict	 dress	code	 of	head-to-toe	 veils	 for	 women	 was	imposed.
There	were	fears	 that	25,000	 families	 which	 were	headed	by	 war	widows	 and
depended	on	working	 and	UN	 handouts	would	 starve.	Every	day	 brought	fresh
pronouncements.	‘Thieves	will	  have	their	 hands	and	feet	amputated,	 adulterers
will	  be	 stoned	 to	  death	 and	 those	 taking	  liquor	  will	  be	  lashed,’	 said	 an
announcement	on	Radio	Kabul	on	28	September	1996.
       TV,	  videos,	satellite	 dishes,	music	and	all	 games	including	 chess,	football
and	kite-flying	  were	banned.	 Radio	Kabul	 was	 renamed	Radio	Shariat	 and	all
music	was	taken	off	the	air.	 Taliban	soldiers	stood	on	main	streets	arresting	men
without	beards.	Unlike	 the	capture	of	Herat	and	other	cities,	a	large	international
press	and	TV	corps	were	in	Kabul	and	for	the	first	 time	they	reported	extensively
on	the	Taliban's	restrictions.	 The	Taliban	 set	up	a	six-man	 Shura	to	rule	 Kabul,
which	was	dominated	 by	Durrani	 Pashtuns	and	did	not	 include	a	single	 Kabuli.
Headed	by	Mullah	Mohammed	 Rabbani,	the	Shura	included	Mullah	 Mohammed
Ghaus	as	Foreign	Minister,	Mullah	 Amir	 Khan	 Muttaqi	 as	Information	Minister,
Mullah	 Syed	Ghayasuddin	Agha,	 Mullah	  Fazil	Mohammed	 and	Mullah	  Abdul
Razaq.
       None	 of	the	 Shura	members	had	ever	lived	 in	a	large	city,	 most	 had	never
even	visited	 Kabul,	 but	they	 were	now	 running	a	 vibrant,	 semi-modern,	multi-
ethnic	city	 of	1.2	 million	 people	in	 which	 Pashtuns	were	only	a	small	 minority.
As	 the	 newly	 formed	  Taliban	 religious	  police	 went	 about	 their	 business	 of
enforcing	 ‘Sharia’,	  Kabul	 was	 treated	 as	 an	occupied	 city.	  There	 was	 little

77
understanding	that	governing	a	large	city	 was	not	the	same	as	ruling	a	village.	 It
appeared	that	all	that	lay	in	the	way	of	a	total	 victory	for	 the	Taliban	was	Ahmad
Shah	Masud.
       Masud	 was	one	of	 the	most	brilliant	  military	 commanders	and	charismatic
personalities	to	emerge	out	of	 the	jihad.	Dubbed	 the	‘Lion	 of	 Panjshir’	 after	his
birthplace	in	his	Tajik	 homeland	of	 the	Panjshir	valley	north	 of	Kabul,	 he	eluded
and	then	fought	to	 a	standstill	seven	huge	Soviet	offensives	 against	the	Panjshir
in	the	 1980s.	Soviet	 generals	termed	him	 unbeatable	and	a	master	of	 guerrilla
warfare.	His	army	 of	some	20,000	men	adored	him	 and	his	reputation	was	at	its
peak	when	he	 took	over	 Kabul	 in	 1992,	foiling	  Hikmetyar's	 attempt	 to	do	 the
same,	as	the	communist	regime	crumbled.	But	four	 years	in	power	in	 Kabul	had
turned	Masud's	 army	into	 arrogant	 masters	who	 harassed	civilians,	 stole	from
shops	and	confiscated	people's	homes	which	is	why	 Kabulis	 first	 welcomed	the
Taliban	when	they	entered	Kabul.
       Born	 in	1953	into	 a	military	 family,	 Masud	studied	at	the	French-run	Lycée
Istiqlal	 in	Kabul.	 He	became	one	of	 the	young	Islamic	 opponents	of	the	 regime
of	President	Daud	and	fled	 to	Pakistan	in	 1975,	after	 he	led	a	failed	 uprising	 in
the	Panjshir.	In	exile	 in	 Peshawar,	Masud	fell	out	 with	 his	colleague	Gulbuddin
Hikmetyar	 and	their	rivalry	 for	 the	next	20	years	was	a	determining	 reason	why
the	Mujheddin	  never	 united	  to	 form	 a	 coalition	  government.	 His	  bitterness
against	Pakistan	for	first	 supporting	 Hikmetyar	 and	then	the	Taliban	 became	an
obsession.	During	the	jihad	 Masud	argued	that	the	strategic	direction	 of	the	war
should	be	 left	 to	the	 Afghans	 to	decide	 rather	than	 the	ISI.	 But	 Pakistan	 was
supplying	 all	 the	 US-provided	 weapons,	which	  created	an	enmity	  which	 still
lasts	today.	Islamabad	was	taken	by	 surprise	when	in	 1992	Kabul	 fell	 not	from
the	south	to	the	Pashtuns,	but	from	the	north	to	the	Tajiks	and	Uzbeks.
       Peacemaking	always	eluded	Masud.	 He	was	a	poor	politician,	  incapable	of
convincing	 other	Pashtun	warlords	 who	 hated	Hikmetyar	  that	 a	Tajik-Pashtun
alliance	 was	the	 only	 feasible	 way	 to	 bring	 peace.	Masud	 may	 have	 been	a
masterful	military	  strategist	but	 he	was	 a	failure	 at	 building	 political	  alliances
between	different	ethnic	 groups	and	parties.	His	major	 problem	was	that	he	was
a	Tajik.	 Except	for	 one	abortive	uprising	 in	 1929,	the	Tajiks	 had	never	ruled	 in
Kabul	and	were	mistrusted	by	the	Pashtuns.
       In	  Kabul	  he	remained	 aloof	  and	 refused	to	  acccept	government	 posts,
declining	the	 post	of	Defence	 Minister	 in	President	Rabbani's	government	 even
though	 he	 commanded	 the	 army.	  ‘There	  is	 an	 old	  Persian	 saying.	  When
everyone	is	looking	for	 a	chair	to	sit	on,	it	is	better	to	sit	 on	the	floor,’	 he	told	me

78
in	 May	 1996,	just	 a	 few	 weeks	before	 the	 Taliban	 were	to	 drive	 him	  out	of
Kabul.	‘Pakistan	 is	trying	 to	 subjugate	Afghanistan	and	turn	 it	 into	a	colony	 by
installing	 a	puppet	government.	It	 won't	 work	 because	the	Afghan	 people	have
always	been	independent	and	free,’	he	added.
       Working	  18	hours	a	day	with	 two	 military	 secretaries,	who	took	it	 in	shifts
to	keep	up	with	 him,	 he	would	 sleep	four	hours	a	night	 and	because	of	fears	of
assasination	never	spent	two	nights	in	the	same	location.	He	slept,	ate	and	fought
with	his	 men	and	invariably	 in	the	midst	 of	a	major	 battle	he	could	 be	found	on
the	frontline.	 In	the	next	few	 months	he	was	to	face	his	greatest	challenge	as	the
Taliban	swept	him	 out	of	 Kabul	 and	appeared	to	be	on	the	verge	of	 conquering
the	entire	 country.	 He	survived,	 but	 by	1999,	 aged	46	 years	old,	 he	had	been
fighting	 virtually	 non-stop	for	25	years.
       Masud's	forces	 now	retreated	up	the	Salang	highway	to	 his	base	area	in	the
Panjshir.	As	 the	 Taliban	 pursued	them,	 Masud's	men	 blew	 up	the	 mountains,
creating	landslides	to	block	 the	entrance	to	the	 valley.	The	 Taliban	launched	an
abortive	attack	on	the	Panjshir	 but	failed	 to	make	headway.	They	pushed	up	the
Salang	highway	 capturing	towns	 along	the	 way	 until	 they	were	 blocked	at	 the
Salang	tunnel	 by	  Dostum's	 forces,	 who	 had	 advanced	south	 from	  Mazar-e-
Sharif.	 It	  was	 still	  unclear	 whose	 side	 Dostum	 would	  take	 and	 his	 forces
refrained	from	engaging	the	Taliban.
       Mullah	  Rabbani	met	 with	 Dostum	 on	8	 October	1996	 in	a	 bid	 to	try	 and
neutralize	the	Uzbeks	 while	 the	Taliban	 went	 after	Masud,	 but	the	 talks	broke
down.	The	Taliban	 refused	to	 allow	 Dostum	autonomy	 and	power	in	 the	north.
Pakistan	also	launched	a	diplomatic	shuttle	in	 a	bid	to	 break	Dostum	away	from
Masud.	However,	Dostum	 realised	that,	despite	his	 differences	with	 Masud,	the
Taliban	posed	the	real	threat	to	 all	non-Pashtuns.	On	10	October	 1996,	deposed
President	Rabbani,	Masud,	Dostum	and	the	 Hazara	leader	Karim	 Khalili	 met	 in
Khin	Jan	on	the	highway	 and	formed	a	‘Supreme	Council	 for	the	Defence	of	 the
Motherland’	 to	counter	 the	Taliban.	 It	was	the	 beginning	of	 a	new	anti-Taliban
alliance	that	would	perpetuate	the	civil	 war.
       In	 their	 rapid	 advance	northwards,	the	 Taliban	had	 spread	themselves	too
thin	and	 Masud	took	 advantage	of	 this,	launching	 a	major	 counterattack	along
the	 highway	 on	  12	 October	 1996.	 He	  captured	 several	 towns,	 killing	   and
capturing	hundreds	of	 Taliban	soldiers	 as	they	fled	 back	to	 Kabul	 in	panic.	 On
18	October	 1996,	Masud's	forces	 recaptured	the	 Bagram	airbase	and	began	to
shell	Kabul	 airport,	even	as	Dostum's	airforce	 bombed	Taliban	targets	in	Kabul.
The	heavy	fighting	 resulted	in	thousands	of	civilian	 casualties	and	forced	50,000

79
people	to	  flee	 their	 homes	 in	 villages	  along	 the	 Salang	highway.	  As	 these
destitute	refugees	arrived	in	Kabul,	 tens	of	thousands	of	Kabulis	–	mostly	 Tajiks
and	Hazaras	–	were	 trying	 to	 escape	in	the	 other	direction	 –	 eastwards	to	 the
Pakistan	border	to	escape	Taliban	reprisals	and	mass	arrests	which	had	begun	in
the	city.
       Faced	 with	 rising	 casualties	the	 Taliban	 began	to	 suffer	 from	 manpower
shortages	and	they	started	conscripting	young	 men	from	 Kabul	 into	their	 army,
entering	mosques	and	seizing	 worshippers.	Thousands	more	volunteers	 arrived
from	Pakistan	where	some	Pakistani	ulema	closed	down	 their	madrassas	so	that
students	would	  have	  no	 choice	 but	  to	 enlist	  en	 masse	 with	  the	 Taliban.
Thousands	of	Pakistani	students	and	Afghans	 from	 the	refugee	camps	began	to
arrive	daily	 in	Kandahar	and	Kabul	 on	buses	hired	by	Pakistan's	Islamic	 parties.
Pakistan	waived	all	passport	and	visa	requirements	for	them.
       Bolstered	 by	 this	fresh	support,	 the	Taliban	 launched	an	attack	 in	western
Afghanistan,	moving	 northwards	 from	Herat	 into	Baghdis	 province.	By	 the	end
of	October	1996	Ismael	Khan	and	2,000	of	 his	fighters,	who	 had	been	in	exile	in
Iran,	were	 flown	  into	 Maimana	 on	 Dostum's	aircraft	  to	defend	 the	 front	 line
against	the	Taliban	in	Baghdis.	Iran	 had	rearmed	and	re-equipped	Ismael	Khan's
forces	in	 a	provocative	 and	 deliberate	attempt	 to	 bolster	the	 new	anti-Taliban
alliance.	 As	  heavy	 fighting	   took	  place	 in	  Baghdis	 during	  November	  and
December,	with	 considerable	 use	of	 air	 power	 by	 both	 sides,	another	 50,000
displaced	people	 fled	 to	 Herat.	 This	  added	to	 what	 was	 now	 a	 catastrophic
refugee	crisis	for	UN	 aid	agencies	as	winter,	heavy	snows	and	fighting	prevented
the	delivery	of	humanitarian	 aid.
       Despite	 heavy	snowfall,	 the	Taliban	pushed	Masud	back	from	 the	outskirts
of	Kabul.	By	 the	end	of	January	1997,	they	had	recaptured	nearly	all	the	territory
they	 had	 lost	 along	 the	 Salang	 highway,	  retaking	 the	  Bagram	 airbase	and
Charikar.	 Masud	 retreated	 into	  the	 Panjshir	 as	 the	 Taliban	  pushed	 up	 the
highway	to	confront	 Dostum.
       The	 fall	  of	 Kabul	 and	 the	intense	 fighting	  that	followed	  created	serious
apprehensions	in	the	entire	region.	Iran,	Russia	and	four	Central	Asian	Republics
warned	the	 Taliban	not	 to	 move	 north	and	 publicly	 declared	 they	would	  help
rearm	 the	anti-Taliban	  alliance.	  Meanwhile	 Pakistan	 and	 Saudi	 Arabia	  sent
diplomatic	 missions	 to	 Kabul	 to	 see	what	 help	 they	 could	 offer	 the	 Taliban.
Appeals	 from	  the	 UN	  and	 other	 international	  bodies	 for	  a	 cease-fire	 and
mediation	failed	 to	 receive	 any	hearing	 from	 the	belligerents.	 The	 region	was
now	deeply	polarized	 with	 Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	 allied	 to	 the	Taliban	and

80
the	other	 regional	states	backing	 the	opposition.	 The	 Taliban	 were	still	  not	 to
receive	the	international	recognition	 they	so	desperately	wanted.	‘We	 don't	have
a	friend	in	 the	world.	We	 have	conquered	three	quarters	of	the	country,	we	have
captured	 the	 capital	  and	  we	 haven't	  received	  even	 a	 single	  message	 of
congratulations,’	said	a	wistful	 Mullah	 Mohammed	Hassan.17
       Yet	  it	  appeared	 that	 Mullah	   Omar's	 refusal	  to	 compromise	  with	  the
opposition	or	the	 UN,	along	 with	his	 unshakeable	faith	and	his	determination	 to
achieve	a	military	  victory,	  had	finally	  paid	 off.	 Kabul,	  the	capital	 of	 Afghan
Pashtun	kings	since	1772	 which	 had	been	lost	 for	 the	past	four	 years	to	 Tajik
rulers,	was	back	in	 the	hands	of	the	Pashtuns.	The	student	movement,	which	 so
many	had	predicted	would	 never	 be	able	to	 take	the	capital	 had	done	just	that.
Despite	their	enormous	losses,	the	Taliban's	prestige	had	never	been	higher.	The
cost	of	their	 victory	 however	was	the	deepening	ethnic	and	sectarian	divide	 that
was	clearly	dividing	 Afghanistan	and	polarizing	 the	region.
       ‘War	 is	a	tricky	 game,’	said	Omar,	who	 remained	in	Kandahar	and	declined
to	even	visit	 Kabul.	 ‘The	 Taliban	took	 five	 months	to	capture	one	province	 but
then	six	 provinces	 fell	 to	 us	 in	 only	 ten	 days.	Now	  we	are	 in	 control	 of	 22
provinces	including	  Kabul.	 Inshallah	 [God	 willing]	   the	whole	 of	 Afghanistan
will	 fall	  into	 our	hands.	 We	feel	 a	 military	 solution	 has	 better	prospects	now
after	numerous	 failed	 attempts	to	 reach	a	 peaceful,	negotiated	 settlement,’	 he
added.18	Northern	Afghanistan	now	appeared	ready	for	the	taking.

                              MAZAR-E-SHARIF	                1997:
                         MASSACRE	         IN	   THE	    NORTH

	



Everyone	 expected	a	Taliban	 spring	offensive	 on	 Mazar-e-Sharif,	the	last
stronghold	in	northern	Afghanistan	of	the	anti-Taliban	alliance	which	was	under
the	control	of	General	Rashid	Dostum	and	his	Uzbeks.	During	the	long	winter
months	there	was	growing	panic	in	Mazar	as	food	and	fuel	supplies	ran	out	due
to	the	Taliban	blockade	and	the	Afghani	rate	of	exchange	doubled	to	US$1	and
then	tripled	as	wealthy	Mazar	citizens	fled	to	Central	Asia.
       Although	most	of	Afghanistan's	population	is	concentrated	in	the	south	and
was	now	 under	Taliban	 control,	 60	 per	 cent	of	  Afghanistan's	agricultural
resources	and	80	per	cent	of	its	former	industry,	mineral	and	gas	wealth	are	in
the	north.	During	the	last	century,	Kabul's	control	of	the	north	had	become	the
key	to	state	building	and	economic	development.	For	the	Taliban,	determined	to
conquer	the	country	and	keep	it	united,	the	autonomy	enjoyed	by	the	northern
warlords	had	to	be	crushed.	Yet	when	the	Taliban	offensive	finally	came	in	May,
nobody	expected	the	bloody	drama	of	betrayals,	counter-betrayals	and	inter-
ethnic	bloodshed	which	was	astounding	even	by	Afghan	standards	and	would
send	the	entire	Central	Asian	region	into	a	tailspin.
       Ensconced	during	the	winter	in	the	Qila-e-Jhangi,	the	Fort	of	War,	on	the
outskirts	of	Mazar,	Dostum	suddenly	found	himself	promoted	by	neighbouring
states	and	many	Afghans	as	a	saviour	and	the	last	hope	against	the	Taliban.
Mazar,	situated	in	the	Central	Asian	steppe	which	begins	north	of	the	Hindu
Kush,	is	culturally	and	ethnically	 as	far	away	from	Kandahar	as	Kandahar	is
from	Karachi.	The	nineteenth-century	fort	is	a	surreal	pastiche	of	a	European
baronial	castle	with	a	moat	and	defence	ditches	and	a	fantasy	from	the	Arabian
Nights	with	its	 massive,	mudbaked	ramparts	and	a	blue-domed	citadel,	which
Dostum	used	as	his	office.	Guarded	by	tanks	and	artillery	and	Dostum's	well-
turned-out	troops,	who	 still	 wore	 the	 uniforms	of	  the	communist	era,	 the
impressive	fort	was	not	the	only	 factor	he	used	to	win	 over	visitors	 such	as
foreign	diplomats	who	now	lined	up	to	see	him.
       He	wielded	power	ruthlessly.	The	first	time	 I	 arrived	at	the	fort	to	 meet

83
Dostum	there	 were	bloodstains	 and	pieces	 of	flesh	 in	 the	 muddy	 courtyard.	 I
innocently	asked	the	guards	if	a	goat	had	been	slaughtered.	They	told	me	that	an
hour	earlier	Dostum	 had	punished	a	soldier	for	 stealing.	The	 man	had	been	tied
to	the	 tracks	of	 a	 Russian-made	tank,	which	  then	drove	 around	the	 courtyard
crushing	his	 body	 into	 mincemeat,	as	 the	garrison	 and	Dostum	 watched.	 The
Uzbeks,	the	 roughest	 and	toughest	 of	 all	 the	 Central	 Asian	 nationalities,	 are
noted	for	their	 love	 of	marauding	 and	pillaging	 –	a	hangover	from	 their	 origins
as	part	of	Genghis	 Khan's	hordes	and	Dostum	 was	an	apt	leader.	 Over	six	 feet
tall	with	 bulging	 biceps,	 Dostum	is	 a	bear	of	 a	man	with	 a	gruff	 laugh,	 which,
some	Uzbeks	swear,	has	on	occasion	frightened	people	to	death.
       Born	 into	 a	poor	 peasant	family	 in	 1955	in	 a	 village	 near	Shiberghan,	he
was	a	farm-hand	 and	a	plumber	 until	 he	 joined	 the	Afghan	 army	 in	 1978.	He
rose	through	 the	ranks	 to	become	 the	commander	 of	 the	armoured	 corps	that
defended	the	Soviet	supply	line	into	 Afghanistan	from	 Hairatan	port	on	the	Amu
Darya	river.	 After	 the	Soviet	 departure	in	1989,	 Dostum	led	 a	ferocious	Uzbek
militia	 force	 called	 Jowzjan,	 named	after	 their	 province	 of	 origin,	 which	 was
used	 by	  President	 Najibullah	   as	  the	 regime's	  storm-troopers	  against	 the
Mujaheddin.	The	Jowzjanis	 fought	all	 over	Afghanistan,	 often	being	flown	 in	 as
a	last	resort	to	prevent	a	government	garrison	being	overrun.
       In	 1992	Dostum	was	the	first	to	rebel	against	his	mentor	Najibullah,	 thereby
establishing	his	 reputation	 for	 treachery	 and	political	  opportunism.	 The	 hard-
drinking	 Dostum	then	became	a	‘good	 Muslim’.	  Since	then	he	had,	at	one	time
or	another	allied	himself	with	 everyone	–	Masud,	Hikmetyar,	 the	Taliban,	Masud
again	–	and	betrayed	 everyone	with	 undisguised	aplomb.	 He	had	 also	been	on
every	country's	payroll	 receiving	 funds	 from	Russia,	Uzbekistan,	 Iran,	Pakistan
and	lately	 Turkey.	 In	 1995	he	 managed	to	be	 on	the	 payroll	 of	 both	Iran	 and
Pakistan,	then	at	daggers	drawn	over	the	 Taliban.1	Although	 he	controlled	 only
six	  provinces	  in	  the	 north,	  Dostum	  had	  made	 himself	   indispensable	 to
neighbouring	 states.	Now	  Iran,	 Uzbekistan	 and	Russia	 who	 had	 propped	 up
Dostum	as	a	secular	buffer	against	Pashtun	fundamentalism,	saw	him	as	the	only
leader	capable	of	saving	the	north	from	 the	Taliban.2	If	 there	was	one	consistent
trait,	it	 was	his	deep	opposition	 to	the	extremist	 fundamentalism	of	 the	Pashtun
factions,	even	before	the	advent	of	the	Taliban.
       Mazar,	 once	a	bustling	stop	on	the	ancient	Silk	 Route,	had	regained	its	pre-
eminence	as	a	key	 staging	 post	in	 the	 now	massive	 smuggling	 trade	between
Pakistan,	 Central	 Asia	  and	 Iran.	 Dostum	  had	 inaugurated	 his	 own	  ‘Balkh
Airlines’	 which	 bought	in	smuggled	goods	from	 Dubai,	while	 the	truck	 traffic	 to

84
the	border	 with	 Central	 Asia,	just	 70	 miles	 from	 Mazar,	provided	 him	 with	  a
steady	income	 in	 transit	taxes	 and	duties.	 Mazar's	bazaars	were	 stocked	high
with	 Russian	vodka	 and	 French	 perfumes	for	  the	hard-drinking,	  womanizing
Uzbek	  troops.	  But	  unlike	  the	  other	  warlords,	   Dostum	  ran	  an	 efficient
administration	 with	 a	 functioning	 health	 and	educational	 system.	Some	 1,800
girls,	the	majority	 dressed	in	skirts	 and	high	heels,	attended	Balkh	University	  in
Mazar,	the	only	operational	university	 in	the	country.
       As	 a	consequence	he	guaranteed	security	to	 tens	of	thousands	of	 refugees
from	 Kabul,	 who	  had	fled	  the	capital	  in	 several	waves	 since	 1992,	 seeking
refuge	in	 Mazar	 which	 they	saw	 as	the	last	 bastion	of	 peace.	Famous	Afghan
singers	and	dancers	who	could	no	 longer	perform	 in	 Kabul	 moved	to	Mazar.	 It
was	also	a	city	of	pilgrimage.	Thousands	came	every	day	to	pray	at	the	blue-tiled
Tomb	 of	 Ali,	  the	cousin	 and	 son-in-law	 of	  the	Prophet	 Mohammed	 and	 the
fourth	 Caliph	 of	 Islam,	 whom	 Shia	in	 particular	 revere.	 Ali	 is	 believed	 to	 be
buried	in	 what	has	become	Afghanistan's	 most	magnificent	 mosque	and	holiest
site.	Near	 Mazar	 lie	 the	ruins	 of	 Balkh,	 called	 ‘The	 Mother	  of	 all	 Cities’	 by
invading	 Arabs	in	 the	 seventh	century.	Here,	 Zoroaster	preached	nearly	 3,000
years	ago,	Alexander	the	Great	set	up	camp	and	the	Persian	poet	Rumi	was	born.
Balkh	 flourished	  as	 a	 centre	of	  continuous	 civilization	   and	 Zoroastrianism,
Buddhism	and	Islam	 before	it	 was	destroyed	by	Genghis	 Khan	in	 1220	and	the
focus	of	culture	and	trade	shifted	to	Mazar.
       Dostum	 was	revered	for	the	simple	fact	that	his	city	 had	not	been	touched	in
the	past	18	years	of	 war.	Mazar's	 citizens	had	never	 undergone	the	devastating
shelling	and	street	battles	 that	had	destroyed	other	 cities.	All	  that	was	about	 to
change.	Uzbek	 clan	history	  is	a	 long	 litany	 of	  blood	 feuds,	revenge	killings,
power	 struggles,	 loot	 and	 plunder	 and	 disputes	 over	 women.	 The	 favourite
Uzbek	sport	of	 buzkushi,	a	kind	 of	polo	 with	 whip-wielding	  horsemen	trying	to
grab	the	carcass	of	a	headless	goat,	is	invariably	used	to	describe	Uzbek	politics.
There	are	 no	teams	 and	no	 rules	 for	 the	 sport,	 an	apt	 analogy	 for	 Dostum's
relations	with	his	brother	officers.
       There	  was	 a	 bitter	 feud	  between	Dostum	  and	 his	 second-in-command
General	Malik	 Pahlawan	 –	Dostum	 was	accused	of	 murdering	 Malik's	 brother
General	Rasul	 Pahlawan,	 who	 had	been	 killed	  in	 an	 ambush	along	 with	  15
bodyguards	in	June	1996.	This	feud,	together	with	fears	that	Dostum	had	already
ordered	Malik's	  murder,	and	 helped	along	 by	 Taliban	 bribes	 and	promises	of
power,	 prompted	 Malik's	 betrayal	 of	  Dostum	 on	 19	 May	 1997	 when	 Malik
called	on	the	Taliban	to	help	 him	oust	his	leader.3Joining	Malik	 were	three	other

85
senior	 Uzbek	 generals,	 his	 half-brother	  Gul	  Mohammed	  Pahlawan,	 Ghafar
Pahlawan	and	Majid	 Rouzi.	Moreover,	 Dostum	 had	not	paid	 his	troops	for	 five
months	and	there	was	unrest	in	the	ranks.
       The	 Taliban	 moved	 north	swiftly	  from	 Herat	 and	Kabul.	 As	 the	northern
provinces	fell	 one	after	another	to	this	unlikely	  alliance	of	 Pashtuns	and	Uzbeks
from	Malik's	 power	 base	in	Faryab	province,	Dostum	fled	 with	 135	officers	 and
men,	first	  to	 Uzbekistan	and	 then	 to	 Turkey.	 On	 the	 way	 to	 Termez	on	 the
Uzbekistan-Afghanistan	 border,	Dostum	 had	to	bribe	 his	own	 soldiers	with	 US
dollars	to	let	his	convoy	 pass.	For	the	Taliban	it	was	a	God-sent	opportunity,	 but
they	had	learnt	 little	 from	 their	 conquest	of	 other	cities,	 where	they	 refused	to
share	power,	remained	politically	  inflexible	  and	would	 not	 relax	Sharia	 law	 in
the	light	of	 ethnic	sensibilities.	If	 Malik	 thought	 that	the	Taliban	would	 give	him
the	kind	of	 autonomy	in	 the	north	enjoyed	by	 Dostum	since	1992,	he	was	badly
mistaken.	It	was	a	deal	made	in	hell	that	unravelled	by	the	hour.
       When	 2,500	heavily	 armed	Taliban	 troops	rolled	 into	 Mazar	 in	their	 pick-
ups	under	Mullah	Abdul	 Razaq	(the	man	who	 had	ordered	Najibullah's	 murder),
they	declined	to	 share	power	with	 Malik	  and	offered	him	 the	insignificant	  post
of	Deputy	 Foreign	Minister	 in	 the	Kabul	government.	 The	Taliban,	the	majority
of	whom	 had	 never	been	in	 the	north	 before,	 arrogantly	 started	disarming	 the
fierce	 Uzbek	 and	 Hazara	 troops,	  took	 over	 the	  mosques	from	  where	 they
declared	the	imposition	of	 Sharia	law,	shut	down	 schools	and	the	university	 and
drove	women	  off	 the	 streets.	It	  was	a	 recipe	 for	 disaster	 in	 a	 city	 where	 a
complex	mix	 of	 ethnic	 and	religious	 groups	lived	 and	which	 had	remained	 the
most	open	and	liberal	in	the	country.
       Pakistani	 diplomats	 and	ISI	 officers	 flew	 into	the	 city	 in	a	 bid	to	 help	the
Taliban	renegotiate	the	terms	of	 the	agreement,	which	was	already	falling	 apart.
Islamabad	then	aggravated	the	situation	 further	 by	prematurely	 recognizing	 the
Taliban	 as	 the	 legitimate	 government	 of	  Afghanistan	 and	 persuading	 Saudi
Arabia	and	the	United	Arab	Emirates	to	follow	  suit.4	The	Uzbeks	had	been	led	to
believe	that	this	 was	a	power-sharing	agreement	and	now	they	 realized	it	 was	a
Taliban	takeover.	 Malik	 was	 caught	in	 the	middle	 and	his	 betrayal	 of	Dostum
was	made	worse	when	he	also	handed	over	Ismael	Khan	to	them,	who	 had	been
fighting	 against	the	Taliban	in	Faryab.5
       On	 the	 afternoon	 of	 28	 May	 1997,	 a	squabble	 broke	 out	 as	a	group	 of
Hazaras	resisted	 being	  disarmed.	 Then	 all	  hell	  broke	 loose.	 First	  Mazar's
Hazaras	and	then	the	 rest	of	 the	population	 rose	 in	 revolt.	 Untrained	 in	street
fighting	 and	 not	 knowing	 the	 maze	of	 city	 alleyways,	 the	 Taliban	 were	 easy

86
victims	  as	they	  drove	 their	  pick-ups	 into	  dead	 ends,	trying	  to	  escape	the
withering	 fire	 from	 houses	and	roof	tops.	 In	15	 hours	of	 intense	fighting	 some
600	Taliban	 were	massacred	in	the	streets	and	over	 1,000	were	captured	at	 the
airport	as	they	 tried	to	 flee.	Ten	top	 Taliban	 political	 and	military	  leaders	were
either	 killed	  or	 captured.	 Those	captured	 included	  Foreign	 Minister	  Mullah
Mohammed	  Ghaus,	  Mullah	   Razaq	 and	  Central	  Bank	   Governor	  Mullah
Ehsanullah.	Malik's	 men	promptly	 started	looting	 the	city,	 including	 the	 offices
of	UN	  agencies,	and	forced	 the	UN	 to	 abandon	the	 city.	 Dozens	of	 Pakistani
students	were	also	killed.
       Malik's	   troops	 swiftly	  retook	 four	  northern	 provinces	  (Takhar,	 Faryab,
Jowzjan	and	Sari	Pul),	which	the	Taliban	 had	captured	only	five	 days	earlier	and
there	was	heavy	 fighting	 for	 control	 of	 three	other	 northern	 provinces	(Balkh,
Samangan	and	Kunduz).	With	 their	 escape	routes	closed,	thousands	of	Taliban
troops	and	hundreds	of	 Pakistani	students	were	captured	and	subsequently	shot
dead	and	buried	in	 mass	graves.	In	the	 south,	Masud	seized	the	 opportunity	 to
launch	 his	 own	  counter-attack,	 once	 again	 capturing	  Jabal	 ul	 Seraj	 at	 the
southern	entrance	of	the	 Salang	tunnel.	He	 blew	up	 the	entrance	of	 the	tunnel,
trapping	the	Taliban	 who	were	still	 in	 the	north	and	were	trying	 to	escape	down
the	road	to	Kabul.
       Masud	 recaptured	more	territory	 around	Kabul	 and	several	towns	in	 north-
eastern	Afghanistan	that	had	fallen	 to	the	Taliban	 just	a	week	 earlier.	Hundreds
more	Taliban	were	either	killed	  or	captured.	Meanwhile	 the	Hazaras,	spurred	on
by	the	 Mazar	 victory	  also	counter-attacked,	 breaking	 the	nine-month	 Taliban
siege	of	 their	 homeland,	 the	 Hazarajat.	Taliban	 forces	 at	 the	 entrance	to	 the
Bamiyan	 valley	 were	 pushed	back	 and	Khalili's	  forces	 moved	 south	 towards
Kabul,	forcing	 thousands	of	Pashtun	villagers	to	flee	to	the	capital.
       It	 was	the	worst	ever	Taliban	 defeat	since	they	had	emerged	just	30	months
earlier	to	 conquer	the	country.	 In	 ten	weeks	of	 fighting	 between	May	 and	July
the	Taliban	 suffered	over	 3,000	casualties,	killed	 or	 wounded,	and	some	3,600
men	were	taken	prisoner.6	More	 than	7,000	troops	 and	civilians	 were	wounded
on	both	 sides	according	to	 the	ICRC.	 Even	 more	 embarrassing	for	Islamabad,
over	 250	Pakistanis	 had	 been	killed	  and	 550	 captured	during	  the	May–July
period.	Morale	 amongst	 the	Taliban	 plummeted	 as	they	had	also	 lost	 some	of
their	best	and	most	experienced	front-line	units.
       Mullah	  Omar	gave	an	urgent	call	for	 students	in	Pakistan	to	come	and	help
the	Taliban.	 Once	again	 Pakistani	madrassas	were	 closed	down	 as	5,000	new
recruits	–	 both	Pakistani	 and	Afghan	 –	 arrived	 to	enlist	 with	 the	 Taliban.	The

87
situation	for	 the	Taliban	 was	deemed	so	serious	that	even	 the	reclusive	Mullah
Omar	was	forced	to	leave	his	sanctuary	in	Kandahar	 and	visit	Kabul	 for	the	first
time	to	meet	his	commanders	and	raise	morale	amongst	his	troops.
       The	 Taliban	  were	 also	forced	  to	 recruit	 increasing	 manpower	 from	 the
Ghilzai	Pashtun	tribes	of	eastern	Afghanistan	and	Pakistan.	But	they	demanded	a
political	 price	 which	 the	Taliban	 were	not	 prepared	to	 pay.	The	Ghilzais,	 who
had	dominated	the	anti-Soviet	war	effort	 were	not	prepared	to	be	used	as	cannon
fodder	by	the	Taliban	 without	 adequate	representation	in	the	Durrani-dominated
Taliban	Shuras.	They	would	 come	if	 they	 were	given	a	share	of	 power.	Ghilzai
commanders	with	  the	 Taliban	  were	 extremely	 critical	  of	  Taliban	 tactics	 in
Mazar.	‘There	 were	 too	many	 mistakes	made	in	 Mazar.	 The	 initial	 agreement
between	Malik	 and	the	Taliban	 happened	in	too	short	a	time.	 They	should	have
discussed	the	agreement	for	 a	 longer	 time	 and	built	  up	a	 dialogue	 with	 each
other.	They	also	made	many	military	  mistakes,’	Jalaluddin	Haqqani,	 the	leading
eastern	Pashtun	commander	with	the	Taliban	told	me	in	Kabul	in	July	 1997.
       Haqqani,	 who	commanded	Taliban	troops	on	the	Kabul	 front,	was	a	veteran
Pashtun	commander	from	Khost	 in	Paktia	 province	who	 had	joined	 the	Taliban
in	1995.	 He	was	 one	of	 the	most	 celebrated	commanders	from	 the	anti-Soviet
war.	 Although	  Haqqani	 was	 made	 a	 minister	 in	  Kabul,	 he	 and	 other	 non-
Kandaharis	remained	extremely	 bitter	 that	 they	were	 kept	out	 of	 the	decision-
making	process	that	took	place	in	 Kandahar	under	Omar,	 rather	than	in	Kabul.7
After	the	Mazar	defeat	the	Taliban	gave	Haqqani	a	large	sum	of	money	to	recruit
3,000	Ghilzai	 tribesmen.	Haqqani	 arrived	with	 his	 men	on	the	 Kabul	front,	 but
being	powerless	to	 make	military	  decisions	and	 the	fact	 that	they	 were	led	 by
Kandahari	 officers	  at	 the	 front	 led	 to	  mass	desertions.	 Within	  two	  months
Haqqani	had	only	 300	 of	 his	new	 recruits	left.	 Even	 more	disturbing	  was	that
villages	 around	Kandahar	 were	 refusing	 to	 send	their	 sons	to	 enlist	 with	  the
Taliban.	 For	  the	 first	  time	  the	 Taliban	  had	 a	 recruitment	  problem	  and	 a
manpower	shortage.
       For	  the	Central	  Asian	 states	the	 bloodshed	 on	 their	 doorstep	 created	a
paranoid	reaction	 as	they	considered	the	 spectre	of	 the	war	 crossing	into	 their
territories	 and	 the	thousands	 of	 Afghan	  refugees	fleeing	 across	 their	 porous
borders.	In	an	unprecedented	move,	military	 security	was	heightened	throughout
the	region.	 Some	3,000	Russian	 troops	on	 the	Uzbekistan-Afghanistan	 border,
25,000	Russian	 troops	 on	 the	 Tajikistan-Afghanistan	  border,	 Russian	 border
guards	in	Turkmenistan	and	local	army	divisions	 all	went	on	a	high	state	of	alert.
Uzbekistan	and	 Tajikistan	 closed	 their	 borders	with	  northern	Afghanistan.	  At

88
Termez,	Uzbek	 helicopter	 gunships	 flew	 patrol	  as	troops	 laid	 tank	 traps	and
fortified	 the	bridge	that	crosses	the	Amu	Darya	river,	 which	 divides	Afghanistan
from	Central	Asia.
       Russia	offered	to	 send	ten	battalions	of	troops	to	Kyrgyzstan	after	an	appeal
by	Kyrgyz	 President	Askar	Akayev,	 even	though	his	country	 has	no	border	with
Afghanistan.	 Russia	and	 Kazakhstan	organized	 an	 emergency	meeting	 of	 the
Commonwealth	of	 Independent	States	(CIS)	to	discuss	the	crisis,	where	Russian
Foreign	Minister	 Yevgeny	Primakov	 promised	‘very	 tough	 and	effective	actions
by	 Russia’,	 if	  the	  Taliban	 advanced	 further.	  Turkmenistan,	 a	 self-declared
neutral	 state	 which	  bordered	 western	 Afghanistan,	  had	 developed	 working
relations	with	the	Taliban	 but	the	Turkmen	were	unnerved	by	the	fighting	 around
Mazar.	 For	 the	  first	  time	 9,000	 Afghan	  Turkmen	  crossed	 the	 border	 into
Turkmenistan	seeking	shelter	from	the	fighting.
       Iran	 said	it	would	 continue	to	support	the	anti-Taliban	alliance	 and	appealed
to	Russia,	India	 and	the	Central	Asian	 states	to	help	them	 also.	Iranian	Foreign
Minister	 Ali	 Akbar	Velayti	 urged	the	UN	 to	intervene.	The	Taliban	 were	furious
with	all	 of	 their	neighbours.	 ‘Iran	 and	Russia	are	interfering	 and	supporting	the
opposition.	  They	   have	  given	   aircraft	   to	  the	   opposition	   to	  carry	   out
bombardments.	Iran	is	flying	 up	to	22	flights	 a	day	to	Mazar	carrying	arms,’	 said
Mullah	Mohammed	 Abbas,	the	Taliban	Minister	 of	Health.8
       Iranian	 and	Central	 Asian	 diplomats	 bitterly	 accused	Pakistan	of	 not	only
supporting	the	Taliban,	 but	 of	lying	 and	betraying	 a	solemn	commitment	 made
by	Prime	Minister	  Nawaz	Sharif	 just	a	week	 before	the	Taliban	 offensive.	At	 a
summit	of	 regional	 heads	of	 state	in	 Ashkhabad,	 the	capital	 of	 Turkmenistan,
Sharif	had	promised	to	reign	 in	the	Taliban	and	prevent	the	war	 spreading	to	the
north.	‘Pakistan's	credibility	  in	 Central	Asia	 is	zero	 right	 now,’	 a	senior	Uzbek
diplomat	told	me.9
       However,	 the	arrival	 of	 the	Taliban	 in	 the	north	 did	have	a	 salutary	effect
on	the	four-year-old	 civil	 war	in	 Tajikistan	 as	it	forced	both	 sides	in	the	conflict
to	quicken	the	pace	of	negotiations	out	of	fear	of	 the	Taliban.	A	 peace	settlement
between	the	Tajik	 government	 and	the	 Islamic	 opposition,	brokered	 by	 Russia
and	the	UN	 was	 finally	  reached	in	Moscow	  on	27	 June	1997.	The	 settlement
provided	a	major	boost	to	Masud	 as	Russia	could	now	re-supply	him	 from	bases
inside	Tajikistan.	 Masud	was	 given	the	use	of	 the	airport	 in	Kuliab	  in	southern
Tajikistan	 where	he	received	 Russian	and	Iranian	 supplies	which	 he	 then	flew
into	the	Panjshir	valley.
       The	 anti-Taliban	alliance	now	 tried	to	cement	their	unity	 by	reformulating	 a

89
new	political	 alliance,	 which	 had	to	take	 into	account	Dostum's	 departure	from
the	scene.	On	13	June	1997	they	set	up	 the	‘United	 Islamic	 and	National	 Front
for	 the	 Salvation	 of	 Afghanistan’	  and	 declared	Mazar	 as	 their	 capital.	 They
reappointed	Burhanuddin	Rabbani	 as	President	and	Masud	as	the	new	 Defence
Minister	 and	promised	 to	 form	 a	new	 government	which	 would	  include	tribal
and	Islamic	leaders	as	well	as	technocrats.	But	the	pact	was	doomed	to	failure	as
again	differences	 between	 Malik,	  Masud	 and	 Khalili	   prevented	the	 Uzbeks,
Tajiks	and	Hazaras	from	working	 together.
       At	 the	root	 of	 the	split	 was	the	other	leaders’	suspicions	of	 Malik	 after	 his
string	 of	 betrayals.	Malik	  had	been	 unable	to	 prevent	 a	force	 of	 some	 2,500
Taliban,	 who	 had	 remained	 behind	 in	 the	 north,	 from	 capturing	  the	 city	 of
Kunduz	 which	 had	an	 airport.	 The	Taliban	 reinforced	 this	 enclave	 with	 daily
flights	 of	men	 and	materials	from	 Kabul.	 While	  Malik	 could	 not	or	 would	 not
drive	the	Taliban	out	of	 the	north,	Masud	was	moving	closer	to	Kabul.
       In	  mid-July,	  Masud	  broke	 the	  military	  stalemate	 north	  of	  Kabul,	 by
recapturing	Charikar	  and	the	 Bagram	 airbase,	killing	  hundreds	 more	 Taliban
troops.	By	September,	Masud's	forces	were	once	again	positioned	only	 20	miles
from	Kabul.	 Both	 sides	traded	artillery	 and	rocket	bombardments,	which	 forced
nearly	180,000	civilians	 to	 flee	the	lush	 Shomali	valley	 just	north	 of	Kabul	 and
now	on	the	front	 line.	 As	the	Taliban	 retreated	from	the	Shomali,	 they	poisoned
water	wells	 and	blew	 up	small	 irrigation	 channels	and	dams	in	 a	bid	 to	ensure
that	the	local	Tajik	 population	would	 not	return	in	 a	hurry.	The	war	was	now	 not
just	uprooting	and	killing	  civilians,	 but	destroying	their	very	 means	of	livelihood
and	turning	Kabul's	agricultural	 belt	into	a	wasteland.
       The	  anti-Taliban	 alliance	  had	 now	 created	 a	huge	 180-degree	 arc	 that
surrounded	Kabul.	To	 the	west	and	north	 of	the	city	 were	Masud's	forces	 while
to	the	east	and	south	were	 Khalili's	 Hazaras.	As	 speculation	mounted	 that	they
may	 launch	 an	  attack	 on	 Kabul,	  the	 Taliban	  remained	 confident	  that	  the
opposition	 was	too	 divided	 to	 attack	Kabul.	 ‘We	  have	divided	 the	 opposition
into	 two	 parts	 by	 putting	  our	 forces	 into	 Kunduz.	  The	 northern	 groups	 are
disunited	against	each	other.	The	other	Uzbek	generals	cannot	rely	on	Malik.	 He
has	already	betrayed	them	 once	and	now	 he	is	 just	trying	  to	save	himself.	 No
group	has	enough	forces	to	 fight	 the	Taliban	 on	 their	own,	 so	they	 have	to	try
and	unite	but	they	can	never	unite,’	said	Haqqani.10
       Doubts	 about	Malik's	 loyalty	 to	 the	alliance	appeared	to	be	justified,	 when
in	September	the	 Taliban	 force	 in	 Kunduz	 took	him	 by	 surprise.	 The	Taliban
broke	out	of	their	 Kunduz	enclave	and	with	the	help	of	 Pashtun	tribes	in	the	area

90
launched	another	attack	on	Mazar.	On	7	September	1997	they	captured	the	town
of	Tashkhorgan,	 creating	panic	 in	 Mazar.	As	 the	 Taliban	 advanced	on	Mazar,
heavy	fighting	 broke	out	 between	Uzbek	troops	 loyal	to	 Malik	 and	others	loyal
to	Dostum.	Malik's	 house	was	burnt	down	by	 Dostum's	troops	and	he	fled	to	 his
base	in	Faryab	province	and	then	escaped	to	Turkmenistan	 from	where	he	went
on	to	Iran.
       In	 a	dramatic	 turnaround,	Dostum	 returned	to	Mazar	 from	 exile	in	 Turkey
and	rallied	his	troops	to	defeat	Malik's	 supporters	and	push	the	Taliban	out	of	the
Mazar	region.	 Mazar	descended	into	chaos	as	the	Uzbeks	again	 looted	parts	of
the	city	and	the	 offices	of	 UN	 aid	agencies	forcing	humanitarian	 aid-workers	 to
abandon	Mazar	 for	 the	 second	time	 in	 a	 year.	As	 the	 Taliban	 retreated	they
massacred	at	least	70	Shia	Hazaras	in	Qazil	Abad,	a	village	south	of	 Mazar,	and
perhaps	hundreds	more.	‘The	Taliban	swept	through	this	village	like	 storm.	They
killed	 about	70	 people,	some	 had	their	 throats	slit,	 while	  others	were	skinned
alive,’	said	Sohrab	Rostam,	a	survivor	of	the	massacre.11
       With	 the	Taliban	 retreating	back	to	Kunduz,	Dostum	tried	 to	consolidate	his
position,	but	Mazar	 was	now	virtually	 taken	over	 by	Hazara	groups	and	Dostum
was	forced	 to	 abandon	the	 Uzbek	 capital	and	 set	up	 his	 base	in	 Shiberghan.
Acute	tensions	between	the	Uzbeks	and	the	Hazaras	undermined	the	anti-Taliban
alliance	 and	Dostum	 still	  had	 to	win	  over	 Malik's	  supporters.	He	 did	 so	 by
exposing	the	atrocities	committed	 by	Malik.	 Dostum's	troops	 unearthed	20	mass
graves	near	Shebarghan	in	the	 Dash-te-Laili	 desert	in	 Jowzjan	province	 where
more	 than	2,000	 Taliban	  prisoners	 of	 war	 had	 been	 massacred	and	 buried.
Dostum	accused	Malik	 of	the	massacres,	offered	the	Taliban	help	to	retrieve	 the
bodies	and	 called	 in	  the	 UN	 to	 investigate.	 He	 released	 some	200	 Taliban
prisoners	as	a	gesture	of	goodwill.12
       Subsequent	UN	 investigations	revealed	that	the	prisoners	had	been	tortured
and	starved	before	dying.	‘The	 manner	of	their	 death	was	horrendous.	Prisoners
were	taken	 from	  detention,	 told	 they	 were	 going	 to	 be	 exchanged	and	 then
trucked	to	wells	 often	 used	by	shepherds,	which	 held	about	10	 to	15	 metres	of
water.	They	were	thrown	 into	 the	wells	 either	alive	or	 if	 they	resisted,	shot	first
and	then	tossed	in.	Shots	were	 fired	and	 hand	grenades	were	exploded	into	 the
well	 before	 the	 top	 was	 bulldozed	 over.’	  said	 UN	 Special	 Rapporteur	 Paik
Chong-Hyun	who	inspected	the	graves.13
       Later	 there	were	eye-witness	reports	which	made	it	clear	that	 vicious	ethnic
cleansing	had	taken	place,	‘At	 night	 when	it	 was	quiet	and	dark,	 we	took	 about
150	Taliban	prisoners,	blindfolded	 them,	tied	 their	hands	behind	their	 backs	and

91
drove	them	in	truck	 containers	out	to	the	desert.	We	lined	them	up,	ten	at	a	time,
in	front	 of	 holes	in	 the	 ground	and	opened	fire.	 It	 took	 about	six	 nights,’	 said
General	Saleem	 Sahar,	an	 officer	 loyal	  to	 Malik,	  who	 had	been	 arrested	by
Dostum.14	The	use	of	 containers	was	particularly	  horrific	 and	they	 were	to	 be
used	increasingly	 as	a	method	 of	 killing	  by	 both	 sides.	‘When	 we	 pulled	 the
bodies	out	of	 the	containers,	their	 skin	was	burned	 black	from	 the	heat	and	the
lack	of	oxygen,’	 said	another	of	 Malik's	 generals,	who	added	that	1,250	Taliban
had	died	a	container	death.
       The	 catastrophe	in	the	 north	and	the	 heavy	fighting	 that	 followed	 through
the	summer	only	 further	 widened	the	ethnic	 divide	 in	Afghanistan	 between	the
Pashtun	Taliban	and	the	non-Pashtuns.	The	country	was	now	virtually	split	along
north–south	lines	 and	also	along	 Pashtun	and	non-Pashtun	lines.	All	  sides	had
carried	 out	  ethnic	  cleansing	  and	  religious	  persecution.	 The	  Taliban	  had
massacred	Shia	Hazara	villagers	and	forced	out	Tajik	 farmers	from	 the	Shomali
valley.	 The	Uzbeks	and	 Hazaras	had	massacred	hundreds	of	Taliban	 prisoners
and	killed	 Pashtun	villagers	 in	 the	north	 and	around	 Kabul.	 The	Shia	 Hazaras
had	also	forced	out	Pashtuns	on	the	basis	of	their	Sunni	beliefs.	More	than	three-
quarters	of	a	 million	 people	had	 been	displaced	by	 the	recent	fighting	 –	 in	 the
north	 around	Mazar,	 on	 the	 Herat	 front	 and	 around	Kabul	  –	creating	 a	 new
refugee	crisis	at	a	time	when	 UN	agencies	were	trying	 to	persuade	refugees	still
living	 in	 Pakistan	to	 return	 home.	Moreover,	  the	divisions	 inside	 Afghanistan
were	manipulated	and	exacerbated	by	its	neighbours,	as	all	countries	stepped	up
aid	to	their	various	 Afghan	proxies.	 This	only	 worsened	the	ethnic	and	sectarian
divide.
       Apart	  from	 the	suffering	 civilians,	  the	biggest	 casualty	of	 the	 stepped-up
fighting	 was	 the	 UN.	  The	 UN	 mediator	 Norbet	 Holl	  failed	  to	 persuade	the
Taliban	that	 the	UN	 was	a	 neutral	peace	broker	 or	the	 opposition	that	 the	UN
would	 protect	the	 interests	of	 the	 ethnic	minorities.	  Nor	 was	Holl	  able	to	 put
pressure	on	regional	 countries	to	 stop	arming	 the	factions.	 Nobody	 trusted	the
UN	 and	 everyone	 ignored	 it.	 Holl	  made	 a	 blunt	 statement	 blaming	 outside
powers	for	 continued	interference	 and	the	inflexibility	   of	 the	belligerents.	 ‘We
have	a	standstill	in	 the	negotiating	 process,	we	just	cannot	continue	 business	as
usual.	 I	 do	  not	 see	 the	 Afghan	  leaders	 as	 puppets	 but	 they	  need	 to	 get
ammunition	from	 somewhere,’	Holl	 said.15A	month	later	Holl	had	resigned.
       The	  Taliban	 leadership,	 unversed	 in	 UN	  procedures	and	 even	 the	 UN
Charter,	proved	to	 be	the	greatest	obstacle.	Mullah	 Omar	refused	to	 meet	Holl,
creating	resentment	within	  the	 UN	 team	while	  other	 Taliban	 leaders	publicly

92
mocked	UN	efforts	 at	promoting	a	cease-fire.	Taliban	resentment	against	the	UN
increased	after	the	débâcle	in	Mazar	and	more	so	after	 the	UN	Security	 Council
refused	to	take	 action	against	the	 Mazar	massacres	or	hand	over	 Afghanistan's
seat	at	the	UN,	which	was	still	occupied	by	President	Rabbani.
       The	 Taliban	 harboured	several	unrealistic	 suspicions	about	the	UN,	 which
no	amount	 of	 diplomacy	 could	 dispel.	 They	 were	 convinced	 that	 the	UN,	  in
league	with	Western	 powers,	was	conspiring	 against	Islam	and	their	 imposition
of	 Sharia	 law.	 They	  also	 accused	the	 UN	  of	 being	 influenced	  by	 regional
countries	in	blocking	 recognition	 of	 their	government.	The	 crisis	within	 the	UN
came	at	a	time	when	it	 faced	dwindling	 funds	 from	wealthy	 donor	countries	 for
aid	programmes	because	of	‘donor	 fatigue’	 over	 the	continuing	 war.	Donations
were	decreasing	further	because	of	 the	Taliban's	discrimination	  against	Afghan
women.	The	 future	 survival	 of	 aid	operations	in	 Afghanistan	 depended	on	 the
UN	agencies	convincing	the	Taliban	to	 moderate	their	gender	policies,	which	the
Taliban	refused	to	do.	Several	Western	non-governmental	organisations	(NGOs)
halted	their	 programmes	in	 Kabul	 because	of	the	 Taliban's	 refusal	to	 let	 them
continue	helping	 women.	In	 the	north	the	fighting	  had	forced	the	NGOs	 to	pull
out	twice	and	they	did	not	return.
       Moreover,	  Taliban	hardliners	 were	 doing	their	 utmost	 to	promote	 a	crisis
with	UN	 humanitarian	aid	 agencies	so	that	they	could	kick	 them	out	of	 Taliban-
held	areas,	under	the	pretext	 that	the	 agencies	were	imparting	 Western	secular
ideas	to	the	population.	At	 the	end	of	September,	heads	of	three	UN	 agencies	in
Kandahar	were	ordered	 to	leave	 the	country	 after	 they	protested	that	 a	female
lawyer	for	 the	 UN	 High	 Commissioner	 for	 Refugees	(UNHCR)	 was	 forced	to
talk	to	 Taliban	officials	  from	behind	 a	curtain	so	her	 face	would	 not	be	visible.
In	 November,	 the	 UNHCR	  suspended	all	 its	 programmes	 when	 the	 Taliban
arrested	four	  UNHCR	  Afghan	  staff.	  Save	the	  Children	 shut	  down	 several
programmes	because	the	Taliban	refused	to	allow	women	to	participate	 in	mine-
awareness	classes.	It	was	becoming	impossible	 to	 provide	 humanitarian	 aid	to
the	population	 anywhere,	even	though	 winter	 was	approaching	 and	there	were
growing	food	shortages.
       The	 Taliban's	 treatment	of	 women	 drew	 enormous	 adverse	publicity	 and
international	 criticism	  when	 Emma	 Bonino,	 the	 European	 Commissioner	 for
Humanitarian	Affairs	  and	19	Western	journalists	 and	aid	workers	 were	arrested
and	 held	 for	  three	 hours	 by	 the	  Taliban	 religious	  police	  in	 Kabul	  on	 28
September	1997.	They	had	 been	touring	 a	female	hospital	 ward	 funded	by	 the
European	Union	(EU),	 when	journalists	accompanying	 Bonino	were	arrested	for

93
taking	 photographs	of	 women	 patients	 –	 all	 photography	 was	banned	 by	 the
Taliban.
       ‘This	 is	an	example	of	 how	people	live	 here	in	a	state	of	terror,’	Ms	 Bonino
told	reporters	 in	Kabul.16	The	 Taliban	 apologized,	but	 Western	enthusiasm	for
funding	 aid	to	 Afghanistan	 was	dealt	another	blow.	  The	Taliban	 then	declared
that	they	would	 segregate	Kabul's	hospitals	 and	not	allow	 women	 to	be	treated
together	with	men	–	and	there	was	only	one	women's	hospital	in	the	city.
       It	 was	now	becoming	 difficult	 for	 the	Clinton	 administration	to	 maintain	its
initial	   sympathy	  for	  the	  Taliban.	  Powerful	   US	  feminist	  groups	  lobbied
Washington	 on	 behalf	 of	  Afghan	  women.	 In	  November	 Secretary	 of	 State
Madeleine	Albright	 issued	the	harshest	criticism	of	the	Taliban	 ever	made	by	the
US.	‘We	 are	opposed	to	the	Taliban	because	of	their	opposition	 to	human	rights
and	their	despicable	treatment	of	 women	and	children	 and	great	lack	 of	 respect
for	human	dignity,’	  Albright	 said	on	a	visit	 to	Islamabad	on	18	November	1997.
Her	statement	was	seen	as	a	significant	indicator	of	the	US	distancing	itself	 both
from	the	Taliban	 and	Pakistan's	support	for	them.	Yet	the	Taliban	 appeared	least
concerned	about	these	international	pressures	and	in	fact	generated	greater	anti-
Western	feeling.	The	 ulema	in	Pakistan	and	Kandahar	told	 Omar	that	he	should
throw	 all	 aid	 agencies	 out	 of	 Afghanistan	  because	they	 were	 spies	and	 the
enemies	of	Islam.17
       In	 a	bid	to	energise	UN	mediation,	 Secretary	–	General	Kofi	Annan	 ordered
Lakhdar	 Brahimi,	 a	 former	 Algerian	 Foreign	 Minister	  to	 tour	 the	 region	and
present	a	report	to	the	UN	Security	Council.	After	 visiting	 13	countries	including
Afghanistan	between	14	 August	and	23	September,	Brahimi's	 conclusions	were
to	mobilize	  greater	international	 pressure	on	 Afghanistan's	 neighbours	to	 stop
aiding	 the	belligerents.	 In	 October	 Annan	 had	 set	up	 a	 Group	 of	 Concerned
Countries	at	 the	 UN.	 The	 group	 nicknamed	 ‘Six	  plus	Two’,	  included	 six	  of
Afghanistan's	neighbours,	 Russia	and	the	 United	 States.18	Brahami	hoped	that
this	 forum	  would	 encourage	 Iran	 to	  talk	 to	  Pakistan	as	 well	  as	 re-engage
Washington	 in	 a	 search	for	  peace.	Another	 aim	 was	 to	 implement	  an	arms
embargo	on	Afghanistan	and	to	start	talks	between	the	Afghan	factions.
       Annan	 followed	 up	these	steps	in	mid-November	with	 a	blistering	report	on
Afghanistan	 to	 the	UN	 Security	 Council,	  in	 which	 for	 the	 first	 time	 he	 used
uncompromisingly	 tough	 language	accusing	regional	 countries,	 especially	Iran
and	Pakistan,	of	fomenting	 the	conflict.	 He	 said	these	states	were	using	the	UN
as	a	 fig	  leaf	 to	  continue	 providing	  aid	 to	 the	 factions.19	 ‘Foreign	  military
material	 and	 financial	 support	 continues	 unabated,	 fuelling	  this	 conflict	  and

94
depriving	 the	warring	  factions	of	 a	 genuine	interest	 in	 making	 peace,’	Annan
said.	‘The	continued	 support	by	 these	outside	forces,	combined	with	 the	apathy
of	 others	  not	 directly	   involved,	  is	  rendering	 diplomatic	   initiatives	  almost
irrelevant.’	 Neither	did	 Annan	spare	the	warlords.	‘The	 Afghan	leaders	refuse	to
rise	 above	 their	 factional	  interests	 and	 start	  working	  together	 for	  national
reconciliation.	  Too	  many	 groups	 in	  Afghanistan,	  warlords,	  terrorists,	 drug
dealers	and	others,	appear	to	have	too	much	 to	gain	from	 war	 and	too	much	 to
lose	from	peace.’20
       Later	 in	 Tehran,	Annan	addressed	the	summit	meeting	of	 the	Organization
of	the	Islamic	 Conference	(OIC)	 and	 bluntly	 criticized	 their	 apathy	in	trying	  to
resolve	the	conflict.	 After	 years	of	neglect,	Afghanistan	now	 appeared	to	feature
on	the	international	 diplomatic	 agenda,	but	 that	did	 little	 to	 satisfy	the	 Taliban
who	 were	 determined	 to	 conquer	 the	 north	  and	 their	 opponents	 who	 were
equallly	determined	to	resist	them.

                                     BAMIYAN	         1998-99:
                          THE	    NEVER-ENDING	              WAR

	



In	 the	 Hazarajat,	the	 country	 of	 the	 Hazaras	in	 central	 Afghanistan,	the
temperature	was	below	freezing.	Under	the	shadows	of	the	towering	snow	–
covered	peaks	of	the	Hindu	Kush	mountains	that	surround	Bamiyan,	Hazara
children	with	extended	stomachs	and	rake-thin	features	played	their	version	of	a
cops	and	robbers	game	they	called	‘Taliban’.	The	Hazaras	were	starving	and	the
game	involved	ambushing	a	Taliban	convoy	of	wheat	and	bringing	it	home	to
their	hungry	families.	 The	children	 were	living	 on	 roots,	berries	and	a	few
potatoes	their	parents	managed	to	grow	in	tiny,	stony	fields,	dug	out	from	the
sides	of	the	steep	valleys.	Only	10	per	cent	of	the	Hazarajat	is	cultivable	and	that
year's	harvests	of	wheat	and	maize	had	failed.
       But	the	Hazaras	were	also	starving	simply	for	who	they	were.	Since	August
1997	in	a	bid	to	force	them	to	 surrender,	the	Taliban	had	closed	all	the	roads
from	the	south,	west	and	east	that	entered	their	mountain	fastness.	There	was	no
relief	possible	from	 the	 north,	where	the	 breakdown	of	law	 and	order,	 the
shortage	of	foodstuffs	and	the	mountain	passes	closed	by	winter	snow	made	it
impossible	for	food	convoys	to	travel	to	Bamiyan,	which	is	situated	at	a	height
of	7,500	feet.	Three	hundred	thousand	Hazaras	in	the	province	of	Bamiyan	were
already	hungry,	while	another	700,000	in	the	three	neighbouring	provinces	of
Ghor,	Wardak	and	Ghazni	were	also	suffering	from	 shortages	–	one	million
people	in	all.
       For	months	the	UN	and	its	sister	organization	the	World	Food	Programme
(WFP)	had	been	holding	tortuous	negotiations	with	the	Taliban	to	allow	relief
convoys	through,	but	 the	 Taliban	 had	 refused.	The	UN	  were	 even	more
frustrated	with	the	fact	that	Pakistan	had	contracted	to	provide	the	Taliban	with
600,000	tons	of	wheat,	but	had	made	no	humanitarian	demand	on	the	Taliban	to
lift	 their	blockade	on	Bamiyan.	It	 was	the	first	 time	 in	the	past	20	 years	of
conflict	that	one	faction	had	used	food	as	a	weapon	of	war	against	another	and	it
demonstrated	the	escalation	in	the	ethnic	 and	sectarian	divisions	that	 were
consuming	Afghanistan.

97
       The	 Hazaras	had	 always	 been	at	the	 short	 end	of	 the	 Pashtun	stick,	 but
never	to	such	an	extent.	These	short,	stocky	people	with	their	distinctive	 Mongol
features	were,	according	to	one	theory,	the	descendants	of	intermarriage	between
Genghis	Khan's	Mongol	 warriors	 and	the	indigenous	 Tajik	 and	Turkic	 peoples.
In	1222	 Genghis	 Khan's	grandson	 was	killed	  by	Bamiyan's	 defenders	and,	 in
revenge,	he	 massacred	the	 population.1	 For	 one	 thousand	 years	 before	 that
Bamiyan	was	the	centre	of	 Buddhism	in	 India	 and	an	important	serai	 or	resting
place	for	the	camel	caravans	on	the	ancient	Silk	Route,	 which	linked	 the	Roman
Empire	with	 Central	Asia,	China	 and	India.	Bamiyan	remained	the	protector	and
capital	of	 Buddhism	 for	 the	whole	 of	 Central	 Asia	 and	India	 after	the	 Islamic
conquests.	A	Korean	monk,	Hui-chao	 who	arrived	 in	the	town	 in	827	 AD	 wrote
that	the	King	 of	 Bamyan	was	 still	 a	Buddhist	 and	it	 was	not	until	 the	 eleventh
century	that	the	Ghaznavids	established	Islam	in	the	valley.
       The	 town	is	still	 dominated	by	two	 magnificent	second-century	AD	 Buddha
colossi,	carved	into	a	sandstone	cliff	face.	The	two	statues,	one	165	feet	high,	the
other	114	 feet	 high,	 are	 weathered	and	 cracked	 while	 the	 faces	 of	 both	 the
Buddhas	are	missing,	but	 their	 impact	is	 stunning.	The	 figures	are	carved	 with
the	classical	features	of	 all	sub-continental	 Buddhas,	but	the	 figures	are	draped
in	Greek	 robes	for	 they	 represented	the	unique	 fusion	 of	 classical	 Indian	 and
Central	Asian	 art	 with	 Hellenism,	  introduced	 by	the	 armies	of	 Alexander	  the
Great.	The	Buddhas	 were	one	of	 the	 wonders	of	 the	ancient	 world,	 visited	 by
pilgrims	from	 China	and	India.
       Thousands	of	 Buddhist	 monks	 once	lived	 in	 the	caves	and	grottos	 carved
into	the	cliffs	 alongside	the	statues.	These	caves,	covered	with	antique	stuccoes,
were	now	  home	to	 thousands	 of	 Hazara	 refugees	who	 had	 fled	 Kabul.	  The
Taliban	 threatened	 to	  blow	  up	  the	 colossi	 when	  they	  captured	 Bamiyan,
generating	high-level	  protests	 from	  Buddhist	 communities	  in	 Japan	and	 Sri
Lanka.	In	the	meantime	they	had	bombed	the	mountain	above	the	Buddhas	eight
times,	creating	more	cracks	in	the	sandstone	niches	that	held	the	figures.
       The	 Hazarajat	had	remained	 virtually	 independent	until	  1893	when	it	 was
conquered	by	 the	 Pashtun	King	  Abdul	 Rehman,	 who	 initiated	  the	first	  anti-
Hazara	programme,	 killing	  thousands	of	 Hazaras,	moving	  thousands	more	 to
Kabul	 where	they	 lived	 as	indentured	 serfs	and	servants,	 and	destroying	 their
mosques.	The	estimated	3-4	million	 Hazaras	are	the	largest	Shia	 Muslim	 group
in	Afghanistan.	 The	sectarian	enmity	 between	the	 Sunni	Pashtuns	and	the	Shia
Hazaras	went	back	a	long	 way,	 but	the	Taliban	 had	brought	 a	new	edge	to	 the
conflict	 for	 they	treated	all	 Shias	as	munafaqeen	or	 hypocrites	and	 beyond	the

98
pale	of	true	Islam.
       Even	 more	irksome	for	the	Taliban,	 was	that	Hazara	women	were	playing	a
significant	political,	 social	and	even	military	 role	in	 the	region's	defence.	The	80-
member	Central	Council	 of	 the	Hazara's	Hizb-e-Wahadat	 party	 had	12	women
members,	many	of	 them	 educated	professionals.	Women	 looked	 after	 UN	 aid
programmes	and	 Wahadat's	efforts	 to	 provide	 basic	 literacy,	  health	care	 and
family	 planning.	Women	 often	fought	 in	 battle	alongside	their	 men	–	some	had
killed	 Taliban	in	 Mazar	in	 May.	Female	professors,	who	 had	fled	Kabul	 had	set
up	a	university	in	 Bamiyan,	probably	 the	poorest	in	the	world	 where	classrooms
were	constructed	with	mud	and	straw	and	there	was	no	electricity	 or	heating	and
few	books.
       ‘We	 detest	the	Taliban,	they	 are	against	all	civilization,	  Afghan	culture	 and
women	in	particular.	 They	have	given	Islam	and	Afghan	 people	a	bad	name,’	Dr
Humera	Rahi,	who	taught	Persian	literature	at	the	university	 and	had	emerged	as
a	leading	poet	of	 the	resistance,	told	me.	Nor	 did	the	Taliban	 appreciate	Hazara
women's	style	of	 dress.	Dr	Rahi	and	her	colleagues	wore	 skirts	and	high-heeled
boots.	The	 poetry	 of	 Humera	 Rahi	 seemed	to	 echo	 the	Hazaras’	 new	 found
confidence	after	centuries	of	oppression	at	the	hands	of	the	Pashtuns.
       ‘Victory	   is	yours	and	God	 is	with	 you,	 victorious	 army	of	 Hazarajat.	May
your	 foes’	 chests	be	the	 target	of	 your	 rifle	  barrels.	 You	 are	the	 winner,	 the
victorious,	God	 is	with	 you.	My	 midnight	 prayers	and	my	cries	at	dawn,	and	the
children	saying	“O	 Lord,	 O	Lord!”,	  and	the	tears	and	sighs	of	the	oppressed	are
with	you.’2
       Despite	  the	siege	 and	 decades	of	 poor	  treatment	 and	prejudice	  by	 the
Pashtun	rulers	 of	  Kabul,	 the	 Hazaras	 were	 now	 on	  a	roll.	  They	  had	 been
instrumental	 in	 defeating	the	 Taliban	 in	 Mazar	 in	 May	 and	 again	in	 October
1997.	They	 had	 also	repulsed	repeated	Taliban	  attacks	against	Bamiyan.	 The
Hazaras	had	once	 made	 up	 the	third	  and	weakest	 link	  in	 the	 Uzbek–Tajik–
Hazara	alliance	confronting	the	Taliban,	 but	now	with	 the	Uzbeks	divided	and	in
disarray	and	 the	Tajiks	  in	 a	position	 of	 stalemate	around	 Kabul,	 the	 Hazaras
sensed	that	their	time	had	come.	‘Our	backs	are	to	the	Hindu	Kush	and	before	us
are	the	Taliban	 and	 their	 supporters	Pakistan.	 We	will	  die	 but	 we	 will	  never
surrender,’	Qurban	Ali	 Irfani,	 the	defiant	deputy	chief	of	Wahadat	told	 me,	as	we
sat	trying	to	 warm	ourselves	in	 front	of	 a	log	fire	 in	 a	room	that	overlooked	 the
Buddhas,	spectacularly	draped	in	moonlight.
       There	was	a	new	found	 confidence	and	pride	in	 their	organization	 and	their
fighting	 prowess.	‘We	saved	the	north	from	the	Taliban,’	 said	Ahmed	Sher,	a	14-

99
year-old	Hazara	soldier,	 who	had	 already	seen	two	years	of	 battle	and	 held	his
kalashnikov	like	  a	professional	soldier.	 The	 Hazaras	were	not	 without	 friends.
Iran	 was	 flying	  in	  military	   supplies	 to	 a	 newly	  constructed	 two-mile-long
landing	strip	 outside	Bamiyan	 and	Karim	 Khalili,	  the	leader	of	 Wahadat,	spent
the	winter	 visiting	 Tehran,	 Moscow,	 New	 Delhi	 and	Ankara	 looking	 for	 more
military	 aid.
       But	  the	 Hazaras	had	 also	overstretched	 themselves.	There	 were	 several
factions	amongst	 them,	all	  competing	for	  territory,	 influence	 and	 foreign	 aid.
Separate	factions	of	 Hizb-e-Wahadat	each	controlled	 a	part	 of	 Mazar	and	 they
fought	each	other	as	well	 as	the	Uzbeks,	turning	 Mazar	into	 a	war	zone	and	the
anti-Taliban	 alliance	into	 a	political	  shambles.	Iranian	and	Russian	intelligence
officers	 made	several	 attempts	at	 mediating	 between	 Dostum,	 who	 was	 then
based	in	Shiberghan,	and	the	 Hazaras,	as	well	 as	between	the	Hazara	factions,
but	no	 side	 would	 compromise.	 In	 February	 1998,	as	 heavy	fighting	  erupted
inside	Mazar	between	the	Uzbeks	 and	the	Hazaras,	Masud	paid	his	 first	visit	 to
Tehran	to	try	and	persuade	the	Iranians	to	do	something	to	 save	the	anti-Taliban
alliance	 before	 it	  was	 too	 late.	 Meanwhile	  the	 Taliban	  sat	out	  the	 winter,
watching	their	 enemies	tear	each	other	 apart	while	 tightening	 the	siege	around
Bamiyan	and	preparing	for	another	attack	on	Mazar.
       Fighting	  continued	through	 the	 winter	 months	in	 the	western	 province	 of
Faryab,	where	the	Taliban	 carried	out	another	massacre	in	January	-this	time	 of
some	600	 Uzbek	  villagers.	  Western	 aid-workers	 who	  later	 investigated	 the
incident	 said	civilians	  were	 dragged	from	  their	 homes,	lined	  up	and	 gunned
down.	 International	  censure	against	 the	 Taliban's	 policies	  escalated	as	 they
imposed	 ever	 stricter	 Islamic	  laws	  and	 punishments	 in	  Kabul.	 The	  public
amputation	of	limbs,	 lashings,	stoning	of	women	 and	executions	became	weekly
events	in	Kabul	 and	Kandahar.	International	 Women's	Day	 on	8	February	1998
was	dedicated	to	the	plight	 of	 Afghan	 women	under	 Taliban	rule.	 A	 hearing	in
the	US	Senate	on	the	Afghan	gender	issue	attracted	widespread	publicity,	 as	did
condemnation	of	the	Taliban's	policies	by	such	luminaries	as	Hillary	 Clinton.
       The	 Taliban	 issued	new	 edicts,	stipulating	  the	exact	 length	of	 beards	for
males	and	 a	 list	 of	 Muslim	  names	 with	 which	  newborn	 children	 had	 to	 be
named.	The	  Taliban	 shut	 down	  the	 few	  home	 schools	 for	 girls	  that	 were
operating	in	Kabul,	 as	the	religious	police	went	 on	a	rampage	forcing	all	women
off	the	streets	of	Kabul	 and	insisting	that	householders	blackened	their	windows,
so	women	would	 not	 be	visible	 from	 the	 outside.	Women	 were	now	 forced	 to
spend	all	their	 time	 indoors,	 where	not	 even	sunlight	 could	 penetrate.	Taliban

100
hardliners	were	determined	to	force	 the	UN	aid	agencies	out	of	 Afghanistan	and
they	provoked	a	number	of	incidents	that	tested	UN	patience	to	the	limit.
       On	 24	 February	1998	all	 UN	 staff	 pulled	 out	 of	Kandahar	 and	halted	aid
operations	there	after	 senior	 Taliban	 leaders	beat	up	 UN	 staff	 and	 threatened
them.	 Mullah	  Mohammed	  Hassan,	 the	  usually	 mild-mannered,	  one-legged
Governor	of	 Kandahar,	threw	a	table	and	a	chair	 at	the	head	of	 one	UN	official
and	then	tried	to	throttle	 him,	because	he	had	refused	to	pave	a	road	in	Hassan's
village.	In	 March,	the	Taliban	refused	to	allow	 Alfredo	 Witschi-Cestari,	 the	head
of	 UN	  humanitarian	  aid	 operations	 to	 visit	  Kabul	  for	  talks.	 And	  the	 UN
remained	deeply	frustrated	 by	the	 Taliban	siege	of	 the	 Hazarajat.	‘In	 the	north
there	is	complete	 insecurity	 for	 our	aid	 operations	and	in	 the	 south	we	have	 a
hell	 of	 a	 horrible	  time	 working	  with	  the	 Taliban.	 In	  the	 north	 there	 is	 no
authority	 and	in	the	 south	there	is	 a	very	 difficult	  authority,’	 Lakhdar	 Brahimi
told	me.3
       Despite	 these	problems	Brahimi	 attempted	to	set	up	a	meeting	between	the
Taliban	and	the	anti-Taliban	 alliance.	Anxious	 to	avoid	 meeting	the	opposition's
leaders	and	 thereby	 give	  them	 further	  legitimacy,	  the	 Taliban	  suggested	a
meeting	of	ulema	from	 both	sides.	For	several	months	they	squabbled	with	 each
other	as	to	who	qualified	 to	 be	an	ulema.	The	UN	 mustered	the	help	of	 the	US.
Bill	 Richardson,	 President	Clinton's	  foreign	 policy	 troubleshooter	 and	the	 US
Ambassador	to	the	UN,	visited	 Afghanistan	for	 a	day	of	parachute	diplomacy	on
17	April	 1998	and	persuaded	both	sides	to	convene	the	ulema	meeting.
       Both	  sides	were	 trying	  to	 woo	 the	 US	 and	 the	 flamboyant	 Richardson
received	a	rapturous	reception.	He	was	deluged	with	 gifts	of	 carpets,	saddlebags
and	turbans.	In	 Kabul	 the	Taliban	 allowed	 the	accompanying	US	 TV	 crews	 to
film	  their	 leaders	 for	 the	 first	  time	 and,	 as	a	 courtesy	 to	 Richardson,	 they
postponed	their	regular	 Friday	 public	 spectacle	of	 lashings	and	amputations	 in
the	city's	football	  stadium.	But	 although	the	Taliban	 leaders	in	Kabul	 promised
to	ease	the	siege	 of	 Hazarajat	and	 discuss	their	 gender	policies	 with	 the	 UN,
Mullah	Omar	rejected	the	agreement	just	a	few	hours	after	Richardson	left.
       The	 ulema	 met	in	 Islamabad	under	 UN	 auspices	at	 the	end	of	 April	  and
after	 four	 days	 of	 talks	 each	side	 agreed	 to	 nominate	 20	 ulema	 to	 a	peace
commission,	 which	 would	  decide	 on	 such	issues	 as	a	 cease-fire,	 lifting	  the
Taliban	 siege	on	 the	 Hazarajat	 and	an	 exchange	of	  prisoners.	However,	  the
Taliban	 then	refused	 to	nominate	 their	 delegation	 and	by	 May	 another	 peace
process	had	collapsed	–	even	as	the	Taliban	prepared	a	fresh	offensive.
       Part	 of	these	preparations	involved	 a	fresh	escalation	with	 the	UN.	 In	June

101
the	Taliban	stopped	all	 women	from	 attending	general	hospitals	 and	ordered	all
female	 Muslim	  UN	  staff	 travelling	  to	  Afghanistan	 to	  be	 chaperoned	by	  a
mehram	or	a	blood	 relative	 –	an	impossible	 demand	to	meet,	especially	 as	UN
agencies	had	increased	the	number	of	Muslim	  female	aid-workers,	 precisely	so
as	to	satisfy	 Taliban	 demands	and	gain	access	to	Afghan	 women.	 The	Taliban
then	insisted	 that	 all	 NGOs	 working	 in	 Kabul	  move	 out	of	  their	 offices	 and
relocate	to	the	destroyed	building	of	 the	Polytechnic	College.	Twenty-two	  out	of
30	NGOs	voted	to	 pull	 out	of	Kabul	 if	 the	Taliban	 did	not	 retract	their	demand,
but	the	Taliban	said	the	issue	was	non-negotiable.
       As	 the	EU	 suspended	all	humanitarian	 aid	 to	areas	under	Taliban	 control,
Brahimi	 dropped	a	bombshell	 by	going	 public	 on	the	UN's	 frustration.	 ‘This	 is
an	organization	that	hands	out	edicts	to	 us	that	prevents	us	from	doing	 our	job,’
he	said.	‘The	 Taliban	must	 know	that	 not	only	 is	 there	a	limit	 to	 what	you	 can
stand	but	that	there	are	growing	  pressures	on	us	–	in	 particular	from	 the	 donor
community	 to	say	that	there's	a	limit.’4	 The	 Taliban	refused	to	 relent	and	on	20
July	1998	they	 closed	down	all	 NGO	 offices	by	 force	and	an	exodus	of	 foreign
aid-workers	 from	  Kabul	  began.	The	  same	day	 the	 bodies	 of	  two	  Afghans
working	 for	 UN	 aid	agencies,	Mohammed	Habibi	 of	 UNHCR	 and	 Mohammed
Bahsaryar	of	 WFP,	who	 had	 been	kidnapped	earlier,	 were	found	 in	 Jalalabad.
The	Taliban	offered	no	explanation	for	 their	deaths.
       With	  more	than	half	 of	Kabul's	 1.2	million	  people	benefiting	 in	some	way
from	NGO	 handouts,	women	and	children	were	immediate	victims	 when	aid	was
cut	off.	  Food	distribution,	  health	 care	and	the	 city's	 fragile	 water	 distribution
network	were	all	 seriously	affected.	As	 people	waved	empty	kettles	and	buckets
at	passing	Taliban	jeeps,	their	reply	 to	the	population	 was	characteristic	of	 their
lack	 of	 social	  concern.	 ‘We	  Muslims	  believe	 God	 the	 Almighty	   will	  feed
everybody	 one	 way	 or	 another.	 If	  the	 foreign	 NGOs	  leave	 than	 it	 is	 their
decision.	We	have	not	 expelled	them,’	 Planning	 Minister	 Qari	Din	 Mohammed
insisted.5
       Meanwhile	  the	Taliban	 had	persuaded	Pakistan	and	Saudi	 Arabia	 to	back
them	in	another	offensive	 to	 take	the	north.	The	 Saudi	intelligence	 chief	Prince
Turki	 al	Faisal	 visited	 Kandahar	in	 mid-June,	 after	which	 the	 Saudis	provided
the	 Taliban	 with	  400	  pick-up	  trucks	 and	 financial	  aid.	  Pakistan's	ISI	  had
prepared	a	budget	of	some	2	billion	 rupees	(US$5	million)	 for	 logistical	 support
that	was	needed	by	the	Taliban.	ISI	 officers	 visited	Kandahar	frequently	 to	 help
the	 Taliban	 prepare	 the	 attack,	 as	thousands	 of	 new	  Afghan	 and	 Pakistani
recruits	from	 refugee	 camps	and	madrassas	arrived	 to	enlist	 with	 the	 Taliban.

102
Meanwhile	 in	  March,	 Iran,	 Russia	 and	 Uzbekistan	 began	 to	 pour	 weapons,
ammunition	  and	 fuel	  into	  the	  anti-Taliban	  alliance.6	  While	  Iran	  flew	  in
planeloads	of	 weapons	to	 the	Hazaras	 directly	 from	 Meshad	 to	Bamiyan,	  the
Russians	and	Iranians	provided	Masud	 with	 weapons	at	an	airbase	in	Kuliab	 in
southern	Tajikistan,	from	where	he	transported	them	into	Afghanistan.
       In	 July,	 the	Taliban	 swept	 northwards	from	 Herat,	 capturing	Maimana	 on
12	July	1998	after	routing	 Dostum's	forces	and	capturing	100	tanks	and	vehicles
and	some	800	 Uzbek	 soldiers	–	 the	 majority	 of	 whom	 they	 massacred.	On	1
August	1998,	 the	 Taliban	 captured	Dostum's	 headquarters	at	Shiberghan	after
several	of	his	commanders	accepted	Taliban	bribes	 and	switched	sides.	Dostum
fled	 to	 Uzbekistan	 and	later	 to	 Turkey.	  Demoralized	 by	 Dostum's	 desertion,
more	Uzbek	 commanders	guarding	 the	western	road	 into	 Mazar	also	 accepted
bribes,	thereby	exposing	the	1,500	strong	 Hazara	force	just	outside	 the	city	 to	a
surprise	Taliban	attack.	 It	 came	in	the	early	 hours	of	 8	August	 1998,	when	 the
Hazara	forces	suddenly	 found	 themselves	surrounded.	 They	fought	  until	 their
ammunition	 ran	 out	 and	only	 100	 survived.	 By	  10.00	a.m.,	 the	 first	 Taliban
pickups	 entered	Mazar,	 as	an	 unsuspecting	public	  was	 going	 about	its	 daily
business.7
       What	 followed	 was	another	brutal	massacre,	genocidal	in	its	ferocity,	 as	the
Taliban	took	 revenge	on	 their	 losses	the	previous	year.	 A	 Taliban	 commander
later	said	that	Mullah	 Omar	had	given	them	permission	to	 kill	 for	two	 hours,	but
they	had	killed	 for	two	 days.	The	Taliban	 went	on	a	killing	  frenzy,	driving	 their
pick-ups	up	and	down	 the	narrow	streets	of	Mazar	 shooting	to	 the	left	and	right
and	killing	   everything	 that	 moved	 –	 shop	 owners,	 cart	 pullers,	 women	 and
children	 shoppers	and	even	goats	 and	donkeys.	 Contrary	 to	all	  injunctions	 of
Islam,	which	 demands	immediate	 burial,	 bodies	were	left	 to	 rot	 on	the	streets.
‘They	 were	shooting	without	 warning	 at	everybody	 who	happened	to	be	on	 the
street,	without	  discriminating	  between	 men,	 women	 and	 children.	  Soon	 the
streets	were	covered	with	 dead	bodies	and	blood.	 No	 one	was	allowed	 to	bury
the	corpses	for	the	first	 six	days.	Dogs	 were	eating	human	flesh	 and	going	mad
and	soon	 the	smell	  became	intolerable,’	  said	a	 male	 Tajik	  who	 managed	to
escape	the	massacre.8
       As	 people	 ran	for	  shelter	to	 their	 homes,	Taliban	 soldiers	 barged	in	 and
massacred	Hazara	households	wholescale.	‘People	were	shot	three	times	on	the
spot,	one	bullet	in	 the	head,	one	in	the	chest	and	one	in	the	testicles.	Those	who
survived	buried	 their	dead	in	 their	gardens.	Women	 were	raped,’	said	 the	same
witness.	'When	 the	Taliban	 stormed	into	 our	 house	they	shot	 my	husband	and

103
two	brothers	dead	on	the	 spot.	Each	was	shot	three	times	 and	then	their	throats
were	slit	in	the	halal	 way,’	said	a	40-year-old	Tajik	 widow.9
       After	  the	 first	 full	  day	 of	 indiscriminate	 killing,	   the	Taliban	 reverted	 to
targeting	the	Hazaras.	Unwilling	  to	repeat	their	mistake	 the	previous	year	when
they	 entered	Mazar	 without	  guides,	 this	 time	 the	 Taliban	 had	 enlisted	 local
Pashtuns,	once	loyal	to	 Hikmetyar,	 who	knew	 the	city	 well.	 Over	 the	next	few
days,	these	Pashtun	fighters	 from	  Balkh	 guided	 Taliban	 search	parties	 to	the
homes	of	 Hazaras.	But	 the	 Taliban	 were	out	 of	 control	 and	 arbitrary	 killings
continued,	even	of	 those	who	were	 not	Hazaras.	‘I	 saw	that	 a	young	Tajik	 boy
had	been	killed	 –	 the	Talib	 was	still	  standing	there	and	 the	father	 was	crying.
“Why	 have	 you	 killed	 my	 son?	We	 are	 Tajiks.”	 The	 Talib	 responded,	 “Why
didn't	you	say	so?”	And	the	father	said,	“Did	 you	ask	that	I	could	 answer?”’10
       Thousands	of	 Hazaras	were	taken	to	 Mazar	jail	 and	when	it	 was	full,	  they
were	dumped	 in	 containers	 which	 were	 locked	 and	 the	prisoners	 allowed	 to
suffocate.	Some	containers	were	taken	to	the	Dasht-e-Laili	 desert	outside	Mazar
and	the	inmates	massacred	there	–	in	direct	 retaliation	 for	 the	similar	 treatment
meeted	out	to	the	Taliban	in	1997.	‘They	 brought	three	containers	from	Mazar	to
Shiberghan.	When	they	 opened	the	door	of	 one	truck,	 only	 three	persons	were
alive.	About	 300	were	dead.	The	three	were	taken	to	the	jail.	 I	 could	see	all	this
from	 where	 I	 was	 sitting,’	  said	 another	 witness.11	As	 tens	 of	 thousands	 of
civilians	 tried	to	 escape	Mazar	by	foot	in	 long	 columns	over	the	next	 few	days,
the	Taliban	killed	 dozens	more	in	aerial	bombardments.
       The	 Taliban	  aimed	 to	 cleanse	the	 north	 of	 the	 Shia.	 Mullah	 Niazi,	  the
commander	who	 had	ordered	 Najibullah's	 murder	 was	appointed	 Governor	 of
Mazar	and	 within	 hours	 of	 taking	 the	city,	 Taliban	 mullahs	 were	 proclaiming
from	the	city's	 mosques	that	the	city's	Shia	had	three	choices	–	convert	to	 Sunni
Islam,	leave	for	 Shia	 Iran	or	 die.	 All	 prayer	services	 conducted	by	the	 Shia	in
mosques	were	banned.	‘Last	year	you	rebelled	against	us	and	killed	us.	From	 all
your	homes	you	shot	at	 us.	Now	we	 are	here	to	deal	with	 you.	The	Hazaras	are
not	Muslims	 and	now	we	have	to	 kill	 Hazaras.	You	either	accept	to	be	Muslims
or	leave	Afghanistan.	Wherever	 you	go	we	 will	 catch	you.	If	 you	 go	up	we	will
pull	you	down	 by	your	feet;	if	 you	hide	below,	we	 will	 pull	you	 up	by	your	hair,’
Niazi	declared	 from	Mazar's	 central	mosque.12	As	the	Roman	historian	 Tacitus
said	of	 the	Roman	 conquest	of	Britain,	  ‘the	 Roman	army	 created	a	desolation
and	called	it	peace.’
       With	   no	 independent	  observers	 around	 to	  do	  a	 body	  count,	 it	  was
impossible	 to	 estimate	 the	 numbers	killed,	  but	 the	 UN	  and	 the	 ICRC	 later

104
estimated	that	 between	 5,000	 and	6,000	 people	 were	 killed.	  It	 subsequently
became	clear	that	along	 the	route	 of	the	 Taliban	 advance	similar	 massacres	of
Uzbeks	 and	 Tajiks	 had	 taken	 place	 in	 Maimana	  and	 Shiberghan.	 My	  own
estimate	is	that	as	many	as	between	6,000	and	8,000	civilians	were	killed	in	 July
and	August,	including	 the	heavy	casualties	amongst	the	anti-Taliban	 troops.	But
the	Taliban's	aim	 to	terrorize	 the	population	 so	that	they	would	 not	 rise	against
them	later,	was	to	remain	unfulfilled.
       The	Taliban	 were	to	target	one	more	group	in	Mazar	that	was	to	bring	 down
a	storm	of	international	protest	and	plunge	them	into	 near	war	with	Iran.	 A	small
Taliban	 unit	 led	 by	Mullah	  Dost	 Mohammed	 and	including	  several	Pakistani
militants	of	 the	anti-Shia,	Sipah-e-Sahaba	party	entered	the	Iranian	Consulate	in
Mazar,	herded	11	Iranian	diplomats,	intelligence	 officers	and	a	journalist	into	 the
basement	and	then	shot	 them	dead.	Tehran	 had	earlier	 contacted	the	 Pakistan
government	to	 guarantee	the	security	 of	 their	 Consulate,	 because	the	Iranians
knew	that	ISI	 officers	 had	driven	into	 Mazar	with	 the	Taliban.	 The	Iranians	had
thought	that	 Dost	Mohammed's	 unit	 had	been	sent	to	 protect	them	 and	so	had
welcomed	them	at	first.13	The	Taliban	had	also	captured	45	Iranian	truck-drivers
who	had	been	ferrying	arms	to	the	Hazaras.
       At	 first	 the	 Taliban	refused	to	 admit	the	 whereabouts	of	the	diplomats	 but
then	as	international	 protests	and	Iranian	fury	  increased,	they	admitted	that	 the
diplomats	had	been	killed,	  not	on	 official	  orders	but	by	 renegade	Taliban.	But
reliable	sources	said	that	 Dost	Mohammed	 had	spoken	to	 Mullah	 Omar	 on	his
wireless	to	ask	whether	 the	diplomats	should	 be	killed	 and	Omar	had	given	 the
go-ahead.	True	  or	 not	 the	  Iranians	 certainly	  believed	 this.	  Ironically	  Dost
Mohammed	later	 wound	 up	in	 jail	 in	 Kandahar,	 because	he	had	brought	back
two	Hazara	concubines	and	his	 wife	 in	 Kandahar	complained	to	 Mullah	 Omar.
Some	400	 Hazara	 women	 were	 kidnapped	 and	 taken	 as	 concubines	by	  the
Taliban.14
       It	 was	the	Taliban	 victory,	 their	control	 over	most	of	 Afghanistan	 and	their
expectation,	 fuelled	   by	  Pakistani	  officials	   that	  they	  would	  now	  receive
international	recognition,	 which	 partly	 prompted	their	guest,	the	Saudi	dissident
Osama	Bin	Laden,	to	become	bolder	in	his	declared	jihad	against	the	US	and	the
Saudi	Royal	family.	  On	7	 August	1998,	 Bin	 Laden's	sympathizers	blew	 up	the
US	Embassies	in	Kenya	and	Tanzania,	 killing	 224	 people	and	wounding	4,500.
This	prompted	the	US	to	launch	missile	 strikes	on	Bin	 Laden's	training	camps	in
north-eastern	Afghanistan	on	20	 August	1998.	 Dozens	of	cruise	missiles	 hit	six
targets	killing	 over	20	 people	and	wounding	30	 more.	The	US	 claimed	that	Bin

105
Laden	had	 been	present	but	 escaped	the	attack.	 In	 fact	 there	 were	few	 Arab
casualties.	Most	of	those	killed	  were	Pakistanis	and	Afghans	who	 were	training
to	fight	in	 India-controlled	 Kashmir.
       The	 Taliban	 were	outraged	and	organized	demonstrations	in	 Afghan	 cities
to	protest	 against	 the	attacks.	 UN	 offices	 in	  several	towns	 were	 attacked	by
mobs.	Mullah	  Omar	  emerged	to	 blast	 Clinton	  personally.	  ‘If	  the	 attack	 on
Afghanistan	is	Clinton's	 personal	decision,	then	he	has	done	it	to	divert	the	world
and	the	American	people's	attention	 from	that	shameful	 White	 House	affair	that
has	proved	Clinton	 is	 a	liar	 and	 a	man	devoid	 of	 decency	and	honour,’	  Omar
said,	in	reference	to	 the	Monica	 Lewinsky	 affair.	 Omar	insisted	 that	Bin	 Laden
was	a	guest,	not	just	of	the	Taliban	but	of	 the	people	of	Afghanistan	 and	that	the
Taliban	 would	 never	hand	 him	 over	to	 the	 US.	‘America	  itself	 is	 the	 biggest
terrorist	in	 the	world,’	 Omar	added.15	As	UN	officials	  evacuated	Kabul	because
of	 growing	 insecurity,	  gunmen	shot	 dead	an	 Italian	 UN	  military	  officer	  and
wounded	a	French	diplomat.	 The	two	 killers,	 Haq	 Nawaz	and	Salim	 both	from
Rawalpindi,	 whom	  the	 Taliban	 apprehended	and	 jailed	  were	 both	 Pakistani
Islamic	militants	 from	the	Harkat	ul	 Ansar	group.
       Instead	 of	trying	 to	 placate	their	 international	 critics	 and	Iran,	the	 Taliban
launched	an	 offensive	  from	 three	 directions	 on	  Bamiyan,	 which	  fell	 on	 13
September	1998	 after	 some	Hazara	 commanders	surrendered	 to	 the	Taliban.
Karim	 Khalili	 and	other	Wahadat	leaders,	together	with	 much	 of	the	population
of	the	town,	took	 to	the	hills	as	the	first	 Taliban	troops	entered.	This	time,	due	to
repeated	international	appeals	to	respect	human	rights,	Mullah	Omar	ordered	his
troops	to	restrain	 themselves	against	Hazara	civilians.	 Nevertheless	killings	 did
take	place	in	Bamiyan	a	few	 weeks	after	the	Taliban	entered.	In	one	village	 near
Bamiyan	 50	 old	  men,	 who	  were	 left	  behind	 after	 the	  younger	 population
escaped,	were	killed	by	the	Taliban.16
       In	  another	tragedy	 on	 18	 September,	just	 five	  days	after	 they	 occupied
Bamiyan,	 Taliban	 fighters	 dynamited	 the	head	of	 the	 small	 Buddha	 colossus,
blowing	 its	face	 away.	They	 fired	 rockets	at	the	 Buddha's	groin,	 damaging	the
luxurious	 folds	of	 the	 figure	 and	destroying	 the	intricate	 frescoes	in	the	 niche,
where	the	statue	stood.	The	two	 Buddhas,	Afghanistan's	greatest	archaeological
heritage,	had	stood	for	 nearly	 2,000	years	and	had	withstood	 the	assault	of	 the
Mongols.	Now	 the	Taliban	 were	destroying	 them.	It	 was	a	crime	that	 could	not
be	justified	by	any	appeals	to	Islam.
       For	 the	Iranians	the	fall	 of	 Bamiyan	was	the	 last	straw.	Iran	said	 it	had	the
right	 of	 self-defence	 under	international	  law	 and	 the	UN	  Charter	 to	 take	all

106
necessary	action	 against	 the	 Taliban	 –	 exactly	  the	 same	argument	 used	 by
Washington	for	 its	missile	strike.	 A	week	 later	Iran's	Supreme	Leader	Ayatollah
Ali	 Khomenei	 warned	of	 a	huge	war	 which	 could	 engulf	 the	entire	region.	 He
accused	Pakistan	of	using	troops	and	 aircraft	in	 the	capture	of	 Bamiyan,	 which
was	denied	by	Islamabad.	 Iran-Pakistan	relations	 sunk	to	a	 new	low	 as	Tehran
flexed	its	 muscles.	Seventy	thousand	Iranian	 Revolutionary	 Guards,	backed	by
tanks	and	 aircraft,	  began	the	 largest	 military	  exercises	 ever	 along	 the	Iran-
Afghanistan	 border.	 In	  October	 some	 200,000	 regular	 Iranian	 troops	 began
another	series	of	exercises	along	the	border	as	the	Taliban	mobilized	some	5,000
fighters	to	prevent	an	expected	Iranian	invasion.
       As	 the	UN	Security	 Council	expressed	fears	of	an	all	–	out	Iranian	 attack,	it
sent	Lakhdar	Brahimi	back	to	 the	region.	The	military	 tensions	between	Iran	and
the	Taliban	only	 subsided	when	Brahimi	met	 with	Mullah	 Omar	 in	Kandahar	on
14	October	1998.	It	was	the	first	 time	that	Omar	had	ever	met	with	 a	UN	official
or	 foreign	 diplomat	  who	 was	 not	 Pakistani.	 Omar	 agreed	to	  release	all	 the
Iranian	 truck	  drivers,	 return	  the	 dead	bodies	 of	  the	 Iranian	  diplomats	 and
promised	to	improve	relations	with	 the	UN.
       The	 Taliban's	confrontation	 with	 Iran	 had	given	Masud	the	 time	and	space
to	regroup	his	forces	and	the	remaining	Uzbek	 and	Hazara	fighters,	who	had	not
surrendered.	At	the	 same	time,	increased	arms	supplies,	including	 vehicles	 and
helicopters,	reached	him	from	 Russia	and	Iran.	Masud	launched	a	series	of	 well
co-ordinated,	lightning	  attacks	 in	 the	 north	 east,	capturing	 a	 huge	swathe	 of
territory	 back	from	 the	Taliban,	 especially	along	 Afghanistan's	sensitive	 border
with	 Tajikistan	  and	 Uzbekistan.	  There	 were	 some	 2,000	 Taliban	 casualties
during	 October	 and	November	 as	 the	demoralized,	 poorly	  supplied	 and	cold
Taliban	garrisons	fought	briefly	  and	then	surrendered	to	Masud.	On	7	December
1998	Masud	held	 a	meeting	of	 all	 field	 commanders	opposed	to	the	Taliban	 in
the	Panjshir	 valley.	 The	collapse	 of	the	 Hazara	and	Uzbek	 leadership	had	 left
Masud	 and	his	  Tajiks	 supreme	 and	 the	 commanders,	who	  included	 several
prominent	 Pashtuns,	appointed	Masud	 as	the	 military	  commander	of	 all	 anti-
Taliban	forces.
       The	 Taliban	offensive,	 the	massacre	of	Hazaras	and	the	confrontation	 with
Iran,	along	with	 the	US	cruise-missile	attack	dramatically	 undermined	the	fragile
balance	of	power	in	the	region.	The	Taliban's	clean	sweep	also	infuriated	Russia,
Turkey	and	the	Central	 Asian	states	who	blamed	 Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	for
backing	 the	 Taliban.	  The	  sharpened	war	  of	  words	 increased	 the	  regional
polarization	between	the	two	 blocks	of	states.	The	foreign	and	defence	ministers

107
of	Kazakhstan,	Kyrgyzstan,	 Uzbekistan	and	Tajikistan	 and	Russian	officials	met
in	Tashkent	on	 25	August	 1998	to	co-ordinate	 joint	 military	 and	political	  plans
to	halt	the	Taliban	advance.
       The	 consequences	of	the	regional	escalation	were	enormous:	there	was	the
danger	of	a	war	between	Iran	and	the	Taliban,	which	 could	also	suck	in	Pakistan
on	the	side	of	the	Taliban;	 Western	investors	and	oil	companies	became	wary	of
further	 investments	  in	 the	 oil-rich	   Caspian	 nations;	 the	  danger	 of	 Islamic
fundamentalism	 spreading	to	 the	 already	 economically	  impoverished	 Central
Asian	states	increased	and	anti-US	feeling	 across	the	region	escalated;	Pakistan
became	more	deeply	polarized	as	Islamic	parties	demanded	Islamicization.
       The	  international	   community	   remained	 frustrated	  with	   the	  Taliban's
intransigence	in	refusing	to	form	 a	broad-based	government,	change	its	stance	on
the	gender	issue	 and	accept	diplomatic	  norms	of	 behaviour.	 UN	 aid	 agencies
were	unable	to	return	to	Kabul.	 Washington	was	now	obsessed	with	Bin	 Laden's
capture	and	the	Taliban's	refusal	to	hand	him	over.	Even	close	ally	Saudi	Arabia,
which	 felt	 insulted	 by	the	 protection	 that	the	 Taliban	 were	giving	  Bin	 Laden,
pulled	out	its	 diplomatic	 representation	in	Kabul	 and	ceased	all	official	  funding
for	the	Taliban,	leaving	Pakistan	as	their	sole	provider.
       These	 international	  frustrations	  resulted,	 on	 8	  December	 1998,	 in	  the
toughest	 UN	   Security	  Council	   Resolution	  on	  Afghanistan	  to	  date.	  The
Resolution	threatened	unspecified	 sanctions	against	the	 Taliban	for	 harbouring
international	terrorists,	 violating	 human	 rights,	promoting	 drugs	trafficking	  and
refusing	 to	 accept	 a	 cease-fire.	 ‘Afghanistan-based	 terrorism	  has	 become	a
plague,’	said	US	 envoy	Nancy	 Soderberg.17	Pakistan	was	the	only	country	 that
did	 not	support	 the	 resolution,	 calling	 it	 biased	 and	by	 now	 Pakistan	 was	as
internationally	 isolated	as	the	Taliban.
       Increasing	 pressure	by	the	 UN,	 the	US	 and	other	 states	forced	both	 sides
back	to	the	negotiating	table	in	early	1999.	Under	UN	 auspices,	delegations	from
the	Taliban	 and	the	opposition	 met	for	 talks	 in	Ashkhabad	 on	11	 March	1999.
The	 talks	 ended	 on	 a	 hopeful	  note,	 with	 both	  sides	 agreeing	to	  exchange
prisoners	and	continue	negotiating.	But	 by	April,	 Mullah	 Omar	 ruled	out	further
talks,	accusing	Masud	 of	duplicity.	  In	 fact	both	 sides	had	used	the	lull	 and	the
talks	to	 prepare	for	 a	renewed	 spring	offensive.	 On	 7	April	  1999,	 Masud	met
with	 the	  Russian	Defence	  Minister	  Igor	  Sergeyev	in	  Dushanbe,	 as	 Russia
announced	it	would	 build	 a	 new	military	  base	in	Tajikistan.	 Clearly	 part	 of	its
role	would	 be	to	step	up	 military	 aid	 to	Masud.	The	 Taliban	were	 re-equipping
themselves	and	recruiting	 more	students	from	 Pakistani	madrassas.	Masud	and

108
the	Hazaras	launched	a	series	of	attacks	in	the	north	east	and	the	Hazarajat.	In	a
dramatic	reversal	Wahadat	 troops	recapatured	Bamiyan	 on	21	April	  1999.	The
north	was	once	again	in	 flames	as	fighting	 spread	and	UN	 peacemaking	efforts
were	back	to	zero.
       At	  the	beginning	  of	 1998	Kofi	  Annan	 had	 warned,	 ‘In	 a	 country	 of	 20
million	 people,	50,000	armed	men	are	holding	 the	whole	 population	 hostage.’18
By	 the	 end	 of	 1998	 Annan	  spoke	 ominously	 of	  ‘the	 prospect	 of	  a	deeper
regionalization	 of	the	 conflict’	  where	Afghanistan	 had	become	‘the	 stage	for	 a
new	version	of	the	Great	Game’.19	Rather	than	bring	peace,	the	Taliban	victories
and	their	massacres	of	 the	peoples	of	 the	north,	 had	only	 brought	 Afghanistan
even	closer	to	the	edge	of	ethnic	fragmentation.
       Annan's	 dire	 predictions	 appeared	to	be	borne	out	 by	 the	end	of	 the	 year
when	UN	 mediator	Lakhdar	 Brahimi	 announced	his	resignation.	He	 blamed	the
Taliban	 for	  their	 intransigence,	 the	 support	 given	 to	 them	  by	 thousands	of
Pakistani	madrassa	students	and	continued	outside	interference.	His	 resignation
in	 October	 followed	  two	  Taliban	 offensives	  in	 July	  and	 September,	which
attempted	to	push	Masud's	forces	out	of	 the	Kabul	region	 and	cut	off	 his	supply
links	with	 Tajikistan	in	 the	north.
       Both	 offensives	 failed	 but	 the	Taliban	 conducted	a	bloody	 scorched-earth
policy	 north	of	 the	 capital,	which	 led	 to	some	200,000	 people	fleeing	 the	area
and	the	devastation	of	the	Shomali	valley	 –	one	of	the	most	fertile	 regions	in	the
country.	As	 winter	 set	in	 tens	of	 thousands	of	 refugees	who	 had	taken	shelter
with	 Masud's	forces	in	 the	Panjshir	valley	 and	with	 the	Taliban	 in	 Kabul	 faced
acute	shortages	food	and	shelter.
       Brahimi's	 resignation	 was	followed	 by	a	much	 tougher	reaction	against	the
Taliban	by	the	 international	community.	 The	UN	 Security	 Council	unanimously
imposed	limited	 sanctions	on	the	Taliban	 on	15	 October	–	banning	 commercial
aircraft	 flights	  to	 and	from	  Afghanistan	 and	 freezing	 Taliban	 bank	 accounts
world	 wide	–	 even	as	Washington	 stepped	up	pressure	on	the	 Taliban	 to	hand
over	Bin	Laden.
       On	  February	  6,	 2000	  the	 Taliban	  came	 under	  renewed	 international
pressure	after	distraught	Afghan	civilians	 hijacked	an	Afghan	 Airlines	 passenger
plane	on	an	internal	 flight	 from	 Kabul	 and	flew	 it	 to	London	 where	they	 asked
for	asylum.	The	hijacking	 ended	peacefully	 four	days	later.	In	 early	March	2000
the	Taliban	launched	abortive	offensives	against	Masud's	forces	but	were	pushed
back.	The	 Taliban	 received	a	 major	 blow	 to	 their	 prestige	when	 two	 top	 NA
leaders,	who	had	 spent	three	years	 in	a	 Taliban	 jail	 in	 Kandahar,	managed	to

109
escape	on	March	27	and	arrived	in	Iran.	 The	included	Ismail	 Khan,	who	 had	led
the	Mujheddin	 resistance	against	Soviet	occupying	forces	in	the	1980's	and	then
fought	the	Taliban.
       In	 April	  the	Taliban	 issued	several	appeals	to	the	international	 community
to	 help	 draught	 victims	  in	 three	 southern	 provinces	 and	a	 locust	 plague	 in
Baghlan	province.	 The	draught	 worsened	over	 the	summer	affecting	 the	 entire
country,	  but	  the	  Taliban's	  refusal	  to	   announce	 a	  ceasefire	 discouraged
international	 aid.	 After	  three	 months	 UN	 agencies	 had	 received	 only	 US	 8
million	 dollars	out	 of	US	67	million	  dollars	for	 a	draught	appeal.	As	the	draught
worsened,	prices	for	foodstuffs	 rose	by	over	75%	 between	January	and	July	and
the	Afghani	 currency	 lost	 some	50%	 of	 its	 value	between	 February	and	 July.
However	that	 did	 not	stop	 the	Taliban	 from	 launching	 their	 summer	offensive
against	the	 NA	 on	 July	 1.	 thousands	of	 Taliban	  troops	 and	dozens	of	  tanks
attacking	from	 five	directions,	 tried	to	 blast	their	way	 through	NA	 positions	just
30	kilometers	north	 of	Kabul.	 However,	 the	Taliban	 lost	some	400	men	as	they
were	repelled	by	Masud's	forces.
       As	 fighting	  subsided	around	Kabul,	 the	Taliban	 launched	an	 offensive	 on
July	28	in	the	north	 east	of	the	country,	in	a	bid	 to	cut	Masud's	supply	lines	with
Tajikistan.	 The	Taliban	 carried	out	 intensive	bombing	 of	 civilian	 targets	as	the
Taliban	slowly	 made	headway	towards	Taloqan,	the	political	 headquarters	of	the
NA.	 After	 a	four	 week	 siege	and	heavy	fighting	  Taloqan	fell	 on	 September	5,
after	Masud	 conducted	a	strategic	withdrawal	  from	 the	city	 to	 prevent	civilian
casualties.	Masud	 withdrew	  to	 the	borders	 of	 Badakhshan,	 the	last	 province
under	his	control	 as	150,000	refugees	fleeing	 Taloqan	and	the	Taliban	 advance
pressed	up	against	the	border	with	Tajikistan	 and	asked	to	be	given	 refuge.	The
Taliban	 also	 captured	 several	 towns	  on	 the	 Afghanistan–Tajikistan	   border,
creating	a	wave	of	panic	in	Central	Asia.
       Throughout	 2000	there	were	 growing	 signs	of	splits	 and	dissent	within	 the
Taliban	leadership,	 while	 the	tribal	 Pashtuns	demonstrated	growing	 resentment
against	 the	  strictures	  and	 corruption	   of	  Taliban	  rule	  and	  their	  lack	  of
consideration	for	 the	suffering	 population.	On	 January	13,	the	money	market	 in
Kabul	 was	robbed	by	 its	Taliban	 guards	who	 stole	 the	equivalent	 of	some	 US
200,000	dollars.	The	 money	maket	shut	down	 in	 protest	for	 several	days	as	the
‘Afghani’	  plummeted	 against	the	US	 dollar.	 On	January	25,	 400	tribal	 leaders
from	 four	 eastern	provinces—Paktiya,	 Khost,	 Paktika	and	 Gardez—forced	 the
Taliban	to	 replace	local	 Governors,	as	they	 protested	the	conscription	 drive	 by
the	Taliban	and	the	 sharp	rise	in	taxes,	which	 they	 complained	were	being	 sent

110
to	Kabul	rather	than	being	used	for	local	 relief.	On	January	27,	over	2000	people
held	an	unprecedented	anti-Taliban	rally	in	 Khost.	The	draught	and	the	Taliban's
insistence	on	continued	fighting,	 increased	public	 criticism	 of	the	 Taliban's	lack
of	concern	 for	 the	civilian	  population.	 Smugglers	 and	transporters	blamed	 the
Taliban	for	harbouring	 Bin	Laden,	which	 had	led	to	UN	 sanctions	and	a	cut	back
in	the	smuggling	trade.	In	 late	April	 the	Taliban	 arrested	the	head	of	its	air	force
General	Akthar	 Mansuri	 and	10	other	 officials	 in	 Kandahar	for	 helping	 Ismael
Khan	escape.
       There	 was	also	 increasing	hostility	  to	 the	Taliban's	 expanding	 support	to
Islamic	 fundamentalist	  and	terrorist	  movements	 from	 neighboring	  countries,
especially	in	 Central	 Asia.	 The	Taliban	 were	playing	  host	to	 extremist	groups
from	Central	 Asia,	Iran,	 Kashmir,	 China	and	Pakistan	whose	militants	  fight	 for
the	Taliban.	The	Islamic	 Movement	 of	Uzbekistan	 (IMU),	 which	 in	the	summer
of	 1999	and	 again	in	 2000	 launched	 abortive	 offensives	 against	Uzbekistan's
regime	have	bases	in	 northern	Afghanistan.	 More	 than	 one	third	 of	 the	15000
strong	Taliban	  force	 which	 captured	 Taloqan	 was	made	 up	 of	 non-Afghans,
which	 included	 3000	Pakistani	 militants,	 1000	 fighters	from	  the	IMU,	  several
hundred	Arabs	under	Bin	 Laden	as	well	as	Kashmiris,	 Chechens,	Philipinos	and
Chinese	Muslims.
       International	 efforts	 by	the	US,	Russia	and	the	regional	 states	to	coordinate
anti-terrorism	  measures	were	  stepped	 up.	 Russia's	 accusations	 against	 the
Taliban	 increased	dramatically	 after	 Kabul	  recognised	the	 government	of	  the
breakaway	Republic	of	Chechnya	and	allowed	the	Chechens	to	open	an	embassy
in	Kabul	 on	January	16,	2000.	After	  the	military	 coup	in	 Islamabad	on	October
12,	1999	 Pakistan	 stepped	up	 its	 support	 to	 the	Taliban	  providing	 increased
military	 aid	to	 the	Taliban	 for	its	 summer	offensive	 in	2000.	Pakistan	remained
the	only	country	 in	the	world	 supporting	 the	Taliban	and	countries	in	 the	region
became	more	hostile	to	the	military	regime.
       Several	 attempts	by	 the	 UN	 and	Organisation	 of	 the	 Islamic	 Conference
(OIC)	 to	 bring	  the	 warring	  factions	 to	 the	 negotiating	 table	 failed	  to	 yield
positive	results.	Francesc	Vendrell,	a	Spanish	diplomat	was	appointed	as	the	new
UN	Secretary	General's	Special	Representative	to	Afghanistan	on	January	18.	In
March	and	again	 in	May,	 the	OIC	 organised	indirect	 talks	between	the	 Taliban
and	the	NA	 in	 Jeddah	with	 no	outcome.	 Even	as	they	 appeared	to	be	winning
control	of	 the	 entire	country,	 the	Taliban	 remained	internationally	  isolated	and
condemned	as	a	pariah	movement	by	all	of	Afghanistan's	neighbors.

                              CHALLENGING	              ISLAM:
                                      THE	    NEW-STYLE
                              FUNDAMENTALISM	                  OF
                                          THE	    TALIBAN

	
Islam	has	always	been	at	the	very	centre	of	the	lives	of	ordinary	Afghan	people.
Whether	it	is	saying	one's	prayers	five	times	a	day,	fasting	in	Ramadan	or	giving
zak&t-	an	Islamic	contribution	to	the	poor	–	few	Muslim	peoples	in	the	world
observe	the	rituals	and	the	piety	of	Islam	with	such	regularity	and	emotion	as	the
Afghans.	Islam	has	been	the	bedrock	for	the	unity	of	Afghanistan's	diverse	and
multi-ethnic	 peoples	 while	  jihad	  has	 frequently	 provided	  the	 principle
mobilizing	 factor	for	 Afghan	 nationalism,	during	 the	resistance	against	the
British	and	the	Russians.
       Rich	or	 poor,	communist,	king	or	 Mujaheddin	it	makes	little	 difference.
When	I	met	with	the	ageing	ex-King	Zahir	Shah	in	Rome	in	1988,	he	quietly
interrupted	the	interview	so	he	could	go	into	the	next	room	to	pray.	Communist
ministers	prayed	in	their	offices.	 Mujaheddin	warriors	would	break	off	 from
fighting	to	pray.	Mullah	Omar	spends	hours	on	his	prayer	mat,	often	doing	much
of	his	strategic	thinking	after	his	prayers.	Ahmad	Shah	Masud	leads	breaks	from
directing	a	battle	to	pray	and	then	goes	into	a	deep	spiritual	silence	as	booming
guns	and	wireless	chatter	fill	the	air.
       But	no	Afghan	can	insist	that	the	fellow	Muslim	standing	next	to	him	prays
also.	Traditionally	Islam	in	Afghanistan	has	been	immensely	tolerant	–	to	other
Muslim	sects,	other	religions	and	modern	lifestyles.	Afghan	mullahs	were	never
known	to	push	Islam	down	people's	throats	and	sectarianism	was	not	a	political
issue	until	recently.	Until	1992	Hindus,	Sikhs	and	Jews	played	a	significant	role
in	the	country's	economy.	Traditionally	they	 controlled	the	money	market	in
urban	centres	and	when	Afghan	kings	went	to	war	they	often	borrowed	money
from	them.
       After	1992	the	brutal	civil	war	destroyed	this	age-old	Afghan	tolerance	and
consensus.	The	civil	war	has	divided	Islamic	sects	and	ethnic	groups	in	a	way
that	before	was	unimaginable	to	ordinary	Afghans.	Masud's	massacre	of	the
Hazaras	in	Kabul	in	1995,	the	Hazaras’	massacre	of	the	Taliban	in	Mazar	in

115
1997	 and	 the	 Taliban	  massacres	of	  Hazaras	 and	 Uzbeks	 in	  1998	 has	 no
precedent	in	Afghan	 history	 and	perhaps	has	irreparably	damaged	the	fabric	 of
the	 country's	 national	 and	 religious	  soul.	 The	 Taliban's	 deliberate	 anti-Shia
programme	has	denigrated	Islam	and	the	unity	of	the	country	 as	minority	 groups
tried	to	flee	 the	country	en	masse.	For	the	first	 time	in	 Afghanistan's	history	 the
unifying	 factor	of	Islam	 has	become	a	lethal	weapon	in	the	hands	of	extremists,	a
force	for	division,	 fragmentation	and	enormous	blood-letting.
       Eighty	 per	cent	of	Afghans	 belong	to	the	Sunni	Hanafi	sect,	the	most	liberal
of	the	four	Sunni	 schools	of	thought.1	The	minority	 sects	were	few	and	scattered
along	the	fringes	of	the	country.	 Shia	Islam	is	 predominant	amongst	the	Hazaras
in	the	Hazarajat,	a	handful	of	Pashtun	tribes,	a	few	Tajik	 clans	and	some	Heratis.
The	Ismaelis,	the	followers	 of	 the	Agha	Khan,	 follow	 a	branch	of	 Shiism.	They
have	always	  lived	 in	  the	 inaccessible	 north-east,	 contiguous	 to	 the	 Ismaeli
communities	in	 the	 Pamir	mountains	 which	 today	constitute	 eastern	Tajikistan
and	Pakistan's	 northern	 areas.	The	 Afghan	  Ismaeli	 leader	 Syed	 Nadir	  Shah
Hussain,	who	died	in	1971	was	made	head	of	the	community	 by	the	Agha	Khan.
His	sons	have	led	the	Ismaeli	community	 since	then,	playing	a	prominant	 role	in
the	anti-Taliban	alliance.	Hindus	 and	Sikhs	who	arrived	with	 the	British	 as	camp
followers	 in	the	 nineteenth	century	had	 mostly	left	 the	country	 by	 1998	as	had
the	Bukharan	Jews	although	a	few	dozen	remained.
       The	 Sunni	 Hanafi	  creed	is	 essentially	 non-hierarchial	 and	 decentralized,
which	 has	 made	 it	  difficult	   for	  twentieth-century	  rulers	  to	 incorporate	  its
religious	 leaders	into	  strong	 centralized	 state	systems.	But	  for	 centuries	 this
admirably	  suited	  the	   loose	  Afghan	   confederation.	  Traditional	   Islam	   in
Afghanistan	believed	 in	minimum	  government,	where	state	interference	 was	as
little	 and	as	far	 away	 as	possible.	Everyday	 decisions	were	 carried	out	 by	 the
tribe	 and	 the	 community.	  Amongst	 the	 Pashtuns,	 village	  mullahs,	 although
largely	 uneducated,	ensured	 that	 the	 mosque	was	 the	 centre	 of	 village	  life.
Students	or	Talibs	studied	at	the	small	madrassas	that	were	scattered	through	the
tribal	areas.	In	 medieval	times	 Herat	was	the	 centre	of	Afghanistan's	 madrassa
system	but	 from	 the	seventeenth	century	 Afghan	 scholars	travelled	 to	 Central
Asia,	Egypt	and	India	 to	study	at	 more	renowned	madrassas	in	order	to	join	 the
ranks	of	the	ulema.2
       Islam	 was	also	deeply	 rooted	in	 Afghanistan	because	Sharia	law	 governed
the	legal	 process	until	 1925,	when	 King	 Amanullah	 first	  began	to	introduce	 a
civil	 legal	code	and	the	state	took	on	the	role	of	training	 ulema	to	become	Qazis,
Islamic	judges.	In	 1946	a	 Sharia	Faculty	was	set	up	 in	Kabul	 University	 which

116
became	the	main	centre	for	integrating	 the	new	 civil	 code	with	 the	Sharia.	This
merging	of	the	traditional	 with	 the	modern	was	epitomized	by	Mohammed	Musa
Shafiq,	the	 last	Prime	 Minister	 under	the	 monarchy,	which	 was	 overthrown	 in
1973.	Shafiq	studied	at	 a	madrassa	and	at	the	Sharia	Faculty	in	 Kabul	 and	then
went	on	to	 take	another	degree	from	 Columbia	University	  in	New	 York.	 When
he	was	executed	by	the	communists	in	1979	his	death	was	widely	mourned.3
       Thus	 it	was	not	 surprising	that	 in	1979	the	mullahs	 did	not	 join	 the	radical
Islamic	Mujaheddin	 parties,	but	 the	more	traditional	 tribal-based	parties	such	as
Harakat	Inquilabi-Islami	 headed	by	Maulana	Mohammed	 Nabi	Mohammedi	 and
Hizb-e-Islami	 led	 by	Maulvi	  Younis	 Khalis.	 Both	 men	were	 maulvis	 who	had
studied	for	 a	time	 at	 the	Haqqania	 madrassa	in	 Pakistan	and	then	 established
their	own	 madrassas	inside	Afghanistan.	 After	  the	Soviet	 invasion	they	 set	up
loose	  organisations	  which	    were	  decentralized,	   unideological	   and	  non-
hierarchical,	but	they	rapidly	 lost	out	 as	the	CIA-ISI	 arms	pipeline	supported	the
more	radical	Islamic	parties.
       Another	  moderating	 factor	 for	  Islam	 in	  Afghanistan	 was	 the	 enormous
popularity	 of	 Sufism,	 the	trend	 of	mystical	 Islam,	 which	 originated	 in	 Central
Asia	 and	Persia.	Sufi	 means	‘wool’	   in	 Arabic	 and	 the	name	 comes	from	 the
rough	woollen	coats	worn	by	 the	early	Sufi	brethren.	The	Sufi	orders	or	Tariqah,
which	   means	  ‘the	   way’,	   was	  a	   medieval	   reaction	  against	  authority,
intellectualism,	 the	law	 and	the	mullah	 and	thus	immensely	appealing	 for	poor,
powerless	people.	The	Sufis	 build	 their	 faith	on	 prayer,	contemplation,	 dances,
music	and	 sessions	of	 physical	 shaking	or	 whirling	  in	 a	 permanent	quest	for
truth.	These	rituals	 create	an	inner	 spiritual	 space	within	 man	that	 the	outsider
cannot	penetrate.	Seven	 centuries	 ago	the	 famous	 Arab	 traveller	 Ibn	  Battuta
described	Sufism:	‘The	 fundamental	aim	 of	the	 Sufi	life	 was	 to	pierce	the	veils
of	human	sense	which	shut	man	off	from	the	Divine	 and	so	to	obtain	communion
and	absorption	into	God.’4
       The	 two	main	 Sufi	orders	in	 Afghanistan	of	 Naqshbandiyah	and	Qaderiyah
played	a	 major	 role	 in	  uniting	 the	 anti-Soviet	  resistance	as	they	 provided	 a
network	of	 associations	and	alliances	outside	the	Mujaheddin	 parties	and	ethnic
groups.	Leaders	of	these	orders	were	equally	 prominent.	The	 Mujaddedi	 family
were	leaders	of	the	Naqshbandiyah	order	and	had	been	king	makers	in	Kabul	for
centuries.	In	a	 brutal	act,	 the	communists	killed	  79	members	of	 the	Mujaddedi
family	 in	Kabul	 in	 January	1979	to	 eliminate	potential	 rivals.	 Nevertheless	one
survivor,	 Sibghatullah	Mujaddedi,	 set	up	 his	own	 resistance	party	in	 Peshawar,
the	Jabha-i	Najat	 Milli	  Afghanistan,	 National	 Liberation	 Front	 of	 Afghanistan,

117
and	became	 a	fierce	  critic	 of	  the	radical	  Islamic	 parties.	 He	 was	 appointed
President	of	the	 Afghan	interim	  government	in	 1989	and	then	 became	the	first
Mujaheddin	President	of	Afghanistan	 in	1992.
       Pir	 Sayed	Ahmad	 Gailani,	 the	head	of	 the	Qaderiyah	 order	and	related	 to
ex-King	  Zahir	 Shah	 through	  marriage,	 set	 up	  the	 Mahaz-e-Milli,	   National
Islamic	 Front	 of	 Afghanistan,	  in	 Peshawar.	Both	 leaders	 were	 supporters	of
Zahir	Shah	and	remained	the	most	moderate	of	all	the	Mujaheddin	 leaders.	They
were	also	sidelined	by	the	CIA-ISI	 nexus	and	by	Hikmetyar	 and	Masud	and	later
by	the	Taliban.	 They	returned	to	politics	 in	 1999	by	setting	 up	a	new	Peace	and
National	 Unity	 party	 that	 attempted	to	 mediate	between	the	 Taliban	 and	their
opponents.
       Before	 the	Taliban,	Islamic	 extremism	had	never	flourished	 in	Afghanistan.
Within	 the	Sunni	tradition	 were	the	Wahabbis,	followers	 of	the	strict	and	austere
Wahabbi	 creed	of	  Saudi	Arabia.	  Begun	 by	 Abdul	  Wahab	(1703-1792)	  as	a
movement	to	cleanse	the	Arab	bedouin	from	 the	influence	of	 Sufism,	the	spread
of	Wahabbism	became	a	major	plank	 in	Saudi	 foreign	policy	 after	 the	oil	 boom
in	the	1970s.	The	Wahabbis	first	 came	to	Central	Asia	in	1912,	when	 a	native	of
Medina,	 Sayed	Shari	 Mohammed	 set	 up	Wahabbi	  cells	 in	 Tashkent	and	 the
Ferghana	valley.	  From	  here	 and	 from	  British	  India	 the	  creed	travelled	  to
Afghanistan	where	it	had	miniscule	 support	before	the	war.
       However,	  as	 Saudi	 arms	 and	money	  flowed	 to	  Saudi-trained	 Wahabbi
leaders	amongst	the	Pashtuns,	a	small	following	 emerged.	In	the	early	 stages	of
the	war,	 the	Saudis	sent	an	Afghan	 long	 settled	 in	Saudi	 Arabia,	 Abdul	 Rasul
Sayyaf,	 to	 set	 up	 a	 Wahabbi	  party,	 the	 Ittehad-e-Islami,	  Islamic	  Unity,	  in
Peshawar.	The	Wahabbi	 Afghans	 who	  are	also	 called	 Salafis,	became	 active
opponents	of	both	the	Sufi	 and	the	traditional	 tribal-based	 parties	but	they	were
unable	 to	 spread	 their	 message	 because	they	 were	  immensely	 disliked	  by
ordinary	Afghans,	who	 considered	it	a	foreign	creed.	Arab	Mujaheddin	 including
Osama	Bin	Laden,	who	joined	 the	jihad,	won	 a	small	Pashtun	following,	 largely
due	to	the	lavish	funds	and	weapons	at	their	disposal.
       Thanks	to	 the	CIA-ISI	 arms	pipeline,	the	engine	of	the	jihad	 was	the	radical
Islamic	parties.	 Hikmetyar	 and	Masud	had	both	 participated	in	 an	unsuccessful
uprising	against	President	Mohammed	Daud	in	1975.	 These	Islamic	radicals	had
then	fled	 to	Pakistan	 where	they	 were	patronized	 by	 Islamabad	as	a	means	to
pressurize	 future	  Afghan	   governments.	  Thus	  when	  the	  Soviets	  invaded
Afghanistan	 in	1979,	 Pakistan	already	 had	effective	 Islamic	  radicals	under	 its
control	which	 could	lead	the	jihad.	 President	Zia	ul	Haq	insisted	 that	the	bulk	of

118
CIA	  military	   aid	  was	  transferred	  to	  these	 parties,	 until	   Masud	  became
independent	and	fiercely	critical	 of	Pakistani	control.
       These	Islamic	 leaders	were	drawn	from	 a	new	 class	of	educated	university
students	–	Hikmetyar	studied	engineering	at	Kabul	 University,	 Masud	 studied	at
Kabul's	French	 Lycée	 –	who	 took	 their	 inspiration	 from	 the	 most	 radical	and
politicized	 Islamic	 party	in	 Pakistan,	the	Jamaat-e-Islami.	The	 Pakistani	Jamaat
in	turn	 was	inspired	 by	 the	Ikhwan	 ul	 Muslimeen	 or	 the	Muslim	  Brotherhood
which	 was	set	up	in	 Egypt	 in	 1928	with	 the	 aim	of	 bringing	  about	an	Islamic
revolution	 and	creating	an	Islamic	 state.	The	 founder	of	 the	Ikhwan,	 Hasan	al-
Banna	(1906–1949)	was	a	major	influence	on	Abul-Ala	  Maududdi	(1903–1978),
who	founded	the	Pakistani	Jamaat	in	1941.
       The	 old	 Ikhwan	 movements	around	 the	Muslim	  world	 wanted	an	 Islamic
revolution	  rather	 than	 a	 nationalist	  or	  communist	  revolution	  to	 overthrow
colonialism.	 In	opposition	 to	the	traditional	 mullahs	 these	Islamicists	refused	to
compromise	with	 the	indigenous	 neo-colonial	 elite	and	wanted	 radical	political
change,	which	would	 create	a	true	Islamic	 society	as	constituted	by	 the	Prophet
Mohammed	in	 Mecca	 and	Medina	 as	 well	 as	deal	 with	 the	 challenges	of	 the
modern	 world.	 They	 rejected	 nationalism,	  ethnicity,	  tribal	 segmentation	 and
feudal	class	structures	in	favour	 of	a	new	Muslim	 internationalism	 which	 would
reunite	the	Muslim	 world	 or	Ummah.5	To	achieve	this,	parties	like	 the	Pakistani
Jamaat	and	Hikmetyar's	Hizb-e-Islami	  set	up	highly	 centralized	 modern	parties
organized	along	communist	 lines	 with	 a	cell	 system,	extreme	secrecy,	political
indoctrination	and	military	 training.
       The	  greatest	 weakness	of	  the	 Ikhwan	  model	  of	 political	   Islam	 is	  its
dependence	on	 a	  single	 charismatic	  leader,	 an	 Amir,	   rather	 than	 a	  more
democratically	constituted	organization	 to	lead	it.	The	obsession	of	radical	 Islam
is	not	the	 creation	of	 institutions,	 but	 the	character	and	purity	 of	 its	leader,	 his
virtues	  and	  qualifications	  and	  whether	  his	  personality	   can	  emulate	 the
personality	of	 the	Prophet	Mohammed.	 Thus	these	movements	pre-suppose	the
Islamic	 virtue	 of	  individuals,	 even	 though	 such	 virtue	 can	 only	 be	 logically
acquired	if	 a	society	 is	 already	truly	 Islamic.6Invariably,	  as	was	the	 case	with
Hikmetyar,	this	model	 allowed	dictatorship	to	 flourish.
       Nevertheless	 these	radical	 Islamicists,	 as	 compared	to	 the	 Taliban,	 were
relatively	 modern	and	forward-looking.	  They	flavoured	 women's	 education	and
participation	 in	 social	life.	  They	developed	 or	tried	 to	 develop	theories	 for	 an
Islamic	 economy,	banking	 system,	foreign	 relations	 and	 a	more	equitable	 and
just	social	 system.	However,	 the	radical	 Islamicist	 discourse	suffered	 from	 the

119
same	weaknesses	and	limitations	as	the	Afghan	 Marxist	 did:	as	an	all-inclusive
ideology,	they	rejected	rather	than	integrated	the	vastly	different	 social,	religious
and	 ethnic	  identities	   that	  constituted	  Afghan	   society.	  Both	  the	  Afghan
communists	and	 Islamicists	 wanted	 to	impose	 radical	 change	on	 a	traditional
social	structure	 by	 a	 revolution	 from	  the	top.	 They	 wished	 to	 do	 away	 with
tribalism	 and	ethnicity	by	 fiat,	 an	impossible	task,	and	were	unwilling	  to	accept
the	complex	realities	on	the	ground.
       The	  Afghan	 Islamicists‘	  political	   failure	 and	 their	  inability	  to	 produce
reality-based	theories	 of	 change	is	 a	 widespread	phenomenon	 in	 the	 Muslim
world.	 The	 French	scholar	 Olivier	  Roy	has	 dubbed	it	 ‘the	 failure	  of	 political
Islam’.7	Muslim	  societies	in	 the	 twentieth	 century	have	 been	divided	 between
two	contradictory	 structures.	The	 clan,	tribe	 and	ethnic	 group	on	one	 hand	and
the	state	and	religion	on	the	other.	It	 is	the	small	group	 versus	the	larger	faith	or
the	tribe	 versus	 the	 Ummah,	 which	 has	been	 the	 main	 focus	 of	 loyalty	 and
commitment	rather	than	the	state.8Afghanistan's	Islamicists	failed	 to	resolve	this
dichotomy.
       The	  Taliban	 had	 set	 out	 as	 an	 Islamic	 reform	  movement.	 Throughout
Muslim	 history,	Islamic	 reform	 movements	have	transformed	both	the	nature	of
belief	 and	political	  and	social	 life,	 as	 Muslim	 nomadic	 tribes	 destroyed	other
Muslim	 empires,	 transformed	 them,	and	 then	were	 themselves	urbanized	 and
later	destroyed.	This	political	 change	has	always	been	made	possible	through	the
concept	of	jihad.	 Western	thought,	heavily	 influenced	by	 the	medieval	Christian
Crusades	has	always	portrayed	jihad	as	an	Islamic	 war	against	unbelievers.	But
essentially	jihad	 is	 the	inner	 struggle	 of	 a	Muslim	  to	 become	a	better	 human
being,	improve	 himself	 and	help	his	 community.	 Jihad	is	 also	a	testing	 ground
for	obedience	to	 God	 and	implementing	 His	 commands	on	 earth.	‘Jihad	 is	the
inner	 struggle	 of	  moral	  discipline	  and	 commitment	  to	 Islam	  and	 political
action.’9
       Islam	 also	 sanctions	rebellion	 against	an	unjust	 ruler,	 whether	 Muslim	 or
not	and	jihad	 is	 the	mobilizing	  mechanism	to	achieve	 change.	Thus	the	life	 of
the	Prophet	 Mohammed	 has	become	the	 jihadi	 model	 of	 impeccable	 Muslim
behaviour	 and	 political	  change	 as	 the	 Prophet	 himself	  rebelled,	 with	  deep
religious	and	moral	anger,	against	the	corrupt	Arab	 society	he	was	living	 in.	The
Taliban	were	 thus	acting	in	 the	spirit	 of	 the	Prophet's	jihad	when	 they	attacked
the	rapacious	warlords	 around	them.	Yet	 jihad	 does	not	 sanction	the	killing	  of
fellow	 Muslims	  on	 the	 basis	of	  ethnicity	 or	 sect	 and	 it	 is	 this,	 the	 Taliban
interpretation	of	 jihad,	which	 appalls	the	non-Pashtuns.	While	the	Taliban	 claim

120
they	are	fighting	 a	jihad	 against	corrupt,	evil	 Muslims,	 the	ethnic	minorities	 see
them	as	using	Islam	as	a	cover	to	exterminate	non-Pashtuns.
       The	 Taliban	interpretation	 of	Islam,	 jihad	 and	social	transformation	was	an
anomaly	in	Afghanistan	 because	the	movement's	rise	echoed	none	of	the	leading
Islamicist	trends	that	had	emerged	through	the	anti-Soviet	war.	The	Taliban	were
neither	 radical	 Islamicists	  inspired	  by	 the	 Ikhwan,	  nor	 mystical	  Sufis,	  nor
traditionalists.	  They	 fitted	  nowhere	  in	  the	 Islamic	  spectrum	 of	  ideas	 and
movements	that	had	emerged	in	Afghanistan	between	1979	and	1994.	It	could	be
said	that	the	degeneration	and	collapse	of	 legitimacy	 of	all	 three	trends	(radical
Islamicism,	 Sufism	 and	traditionalism)	  into	a	 naked,	rapacious	power	 struggle
created	the	 ideological	 vacuum	 which	  the	 Taliban	 were	 to	 fill.	  The	 Taliban
represented	nobody	but	 themselves	and	they	 recognized	no	 Islam	 except	their
own.	But	 they	did	 have	an	ideological	 base	–	an	extreme	form	 of	Deobandism,
which	was	being	preached	by	Pakistani	Islamic	 parties	in	Afghan	 refugee	camps
in	Pakistan.	The	Deobandis,	a	branch	of	Sunni	Hanafi	 Islam	has	had	a	history	in
Afghanistan,	 but	  the	 Taliban's	  interpretation	  of	  the	 creed	 has	 no	  parallel
anywhere	in	the	Muslim	 world.
       The	 Deobandis	arose	in	 British	 India,	 not	 as	a	reactionary	 but	a	forward-
looking	movement	that	would	 reform	 and	unite	Muslim	 society	as	it	struggled	to
live	 within	  the	 confines	 of	 a	 colonial	 state	 ruled	 by	 non-Muslims.	  Its	 main
ideologues	were	Mohammed	 Qasim	Nanautawi	 (1833–	77)	 and	Rashid	Ahmed
Gangohi	(1829–1905),	 who	 founded	the	 first	 madrassa	in	 Deoband	near	 New
Dehli.	The	Indian	 Mutiny	 of	1857	was	a	watershed	for	Indian	 Muslims,	who	 had
led	the	anti-British	 revolt	and	had	been	severely	defeated.	In	the	aftermath	of	the
Mutiny	  several	 philosophical	  and	 religious	  trends	 emerged	amongst	 Indian
Muslims	 in	a	 bid	to	 revive	 their	 standing.	They	 ranged	from	 the	Deobandis	to
pro-Western	 reformers	  who	  set	 up	 colleges	  such	 as	 the	  Aligarh	  Muslim
University	 based	on	the	British	 model	 which	 would	 teach	Islam	and	the	liberal
arts	and	sciences,	so	Muslim	 youth	could	 catch	up	with	 their	 British	 rulers	 and
compete	with	the	growing	Hindu	 elite.
       All	  these	reformers	 saw	education	 as	the	 key	to	 creating	 a	new,	 modern
Muslim.	 The	 Deobandis	aimed	 to	 train	 a	new	 generation	of	 learned	 Muslims
who	 would	  revive	  Islamic	  values	  based	 on	 intellectual	  learning,	  spiritual
experience,	Sharia	law	and	Tariqah	 or	the	path.	 By	teaching	 their	students	how
to	interprate	 Sharia,	 they	 aimed	 to	 harmonize	the	 classical	 Sharia	 texts	with
current	realities.	 The	Deobandis	 took	 a	restrictive	 view	 of	 the	role	 of	 women,
opposed	all	forms	of	hierarchy	 in	the	Muslim	 community	 and	rejected	the	Shia	–

121
but	the	 Taliban	 were	 to	 take	 these	beliefs	 to	 an	 extreme	 which	 the	 original
Deobandis	would	 never	have	recognized.	 The	Deobandis	 set	up	madrassas	all
over	India	and	Afghan	 students,	themselves	searching	for	a	better	understanding
of	how	Islam	 could	cope	with	 colonialism,	 arrived	to	 study.	By	1879	 there	were
12	 Deobandi	 madrassas	 across	 India	  and	 Afghan	  students	 were	 plentiful,
although	they	were	 described	as	‘rowdy	 and	quick	 tempered’.10	By	1967	 when
Deoband	celebrated	its	 first	 centenary,	 there	were	 9,000	Deobandi	 madrassas
across	South	Asia.
       In	 the	early	 twentieth	 century,	the	Afghan	 government	 sought	cooperation
with	 Deoband	 to	 expand	 its	 own	  attempt	 to	 build	  modern,	 state	controlled
madrassas.	Ulema	from	the	Deoband	 madrassa	visited	Kabul	 in	 1933	for	 King
Zahir	Shah's	coronation	 and	said	 that	Deoband	would,	  ‘prepare	such	ulema	 in
the	changed	circumstances	of	the	period	that	they	may	 co-operate	fully	 with	 the
aim	and	purpose	of	the	free	governments	in	the	world	of	 Islam	and	prove	sincere
workers	for	  the	state’.11	A	 few	 Deobandi	 madrassas	were	 established	by	 the
Afghan	state,	but	they	were	not	hugely	popular	even	in	the	Pashtun	belt.
       Deobandi	 madrassas	developed	much	faster	in	Pakistan	after	its	creation	in
1947.	The	Deobandis	set	up	the	 JUI,	a	purely	 religious	 movement	to	 propagate
their	beliefs	 and	mobilize	 the	community	 of	 believers.	In	 1962	its	 leader	in	the
North	West	 Frontier	 Province	NWFP,	 Maulana	 Ghulam	 Ghaus	Hazarvi	 turned
the	JUI	 into	 a	political	  party,	as	a	 result	of	 which	 it	 quickly	  split	 into	 several
factions.	Maulana	 Mufti	  Mehmood,	  a	dynamic	 leader,	 took	 over	 the	Pashtun
faction	 of	 the	JUI	  in	 the	NWFP	  and	remoulded	 it	 in	 a	 populist	 form.	 Mufti
Mehmood's	JUI	 played	a	leading	 role	 in	the	 1970	elections	mobilizing	  support
against	military	 rule.	He	propagated	a	22-point	Islamic	agenda,	which	included	 a
progressive	 social	 programme	  and	 a	 strong	  anti-American,	  anti-imperialist
stance.	The	JUI	campaign	was	marked	by	a	bitter	 feud	with	 the	Jamaat-e-Islami
and	the	rift	between	the	two	largest	Islamic	parties	persists	to	this	day.12
       The	 history	 of	 the	JUI	 in	 Pakistan	is	 not	relevant	 here,	but	 the	Deobandi
creed	was	 to	 become	the	 primary	 religious	  and	ideological	  influence	 on	 the
Taliban.	During	 the	1980s	Pakistan's	Afghan	policy	was	conducted	with	 the	help
of	the	Jamaat-e-Islami	 and	Hikmetyar's	 Hizb-e-Islami,	 who	 were	also	 the	main
rivals	of	 the	JUI	 inside	Pakistan.	The	 ISI's	connection	 with	 the	Jamaat-e-Islami
was	an	important	policy	 instrument	 in	the	distribution	 of	 aid	to	the	Mujaheddin.
The	 JUI,	  which	  was	 now	 run	  by	 Mufti	   Mehmood's	  son,	 Maulana	 Fazlur
Rehman,	 was	 given	 no	  political	  role	  and	 the	 small	  pro-Deobandi	 Afghan
Mujaheddin	groups	were	largely	ignored.

122
       However,	 the	 JUI	used	this	 period	to	 set	up	hundreds	of	 madrassas	along
the	Pashtun	belt	in	the	NWFP	and	Baluchistan	where	it	 offered	young	Pakistanis
and	Afghan	 refugees	the	chance	of	 a	free	education,	 food,	shelter	 and	military
training.	 These	madrassas	were	 to	train	 a	 new	generation	 of	 Afghans	 for	 the
post-Soviet	period.	Even	though	the	Deobandis	received	no	political	 support,	the
military	  regime	 of	 President	 Zia	  ul	 Haq	 funded	 madrassas	 of	 all	  sectarian
persuasions.	In	1971	there	were	only	900	 madrassas	in	Pakistan,	but	by	the	end
of	the	Zia	era	in	1988	there	were	8,000	madrassas	and	25,000	unregistered	ones,
educating	 over	 half	  a	 million	   students.	As	  Pakistan's	 state-run	 educational
system	steadily	 collapsed,	these	madrassas	 became	the	only	  avenue	for	 boys
from	poor	families	 to	receive	the	semblance	of	an	education.13
       Most	 of	these	madrassas	were	in	rural	areas	and	Afghan	refugee	camps	and
were	run	 by	 semi-educated	mullahs	 who	 were	 far	 removed	from	 the	 original
reformist	 agenda	of	 the	 Deobandi	 school.	 Their	 interpretation	  of	 Sharia	was
heavily	influenced	 by	 Pashtunwali,	the	tribal	 code	of	 the	Pashtuns,	while	 funds
from	 Saudi	 Arabia	 to	 madrassas	and	 parties	 which	 were	 sympathetic	 to	 the
Wahabbi	creed,	as	the	Deobandis	were,	helped	these	madrassas	turn	out	 young
militants	who	 were	deeply	cynical	 of	those	who	had	fought	 the	jihad	 against	the
Soviets.	After	the	1992	capture	of	Kabul	 by	the	Mujaheddin,	the	ISI	 continued	to
ignore	the	 JUI's	 growing	 influence	  over	the	 southern	 Pashtuns.	The	JUI	 was
politically	 isolated	 at	home,	remaining	 in	opposition	 to	 the	first	 Benazir	Bhutto
government	(1988–90)	and	the	first	Nawaz	Sharif	government	(1990–93).
       However	  in	  the	 1993	 elections	 the	 JUI	  allied	 itself	  with	  the	 winning
Pakistan	People's	Party	(PPP)	led	by	Benazir	Bhutto,	thus	becoming	a	part	of	the
ruling	 coalition.14	The	JUI's	 access	to	the	corridors	 of	 power	 for	the	 first	 time
allowed	it	to	 establish	close	links	with	the	army,	 the	ISI	and	the	Interior	 Ministry
under	retired	General	Naseerullah	Babar.	Babar	was	in	 search	of	a	new	Pashtun
group	which	 could	 revive	 Pashtun	fortunes	 in	 Afghanistan	 and	give	 access	to
Pakistani	trade	 with	  Central	 Asia	 through	 southern	 Afghanistan	 and	 the	JUI
offered	him	that	 opportunity.	The	 JUI	leader	Maulana	Fazlur	Rehman	was	made
Chairman	of	the	National	 Assembly's	Standing	Committee	for	 Foreign	Affairs,	 a
position	that	 enabled	him	to	 have	influence	on	 foreign	 policy	 for	the	 first	 time.
He	was	to	 use	his	position	 to	visit	 Washington	 and	European	capitals	 to	lobby
for	 the	Taliban	 and	 Saudi	Arabia	  and	the	 Gulf	 states	to	 enlist	 their	 financial
support.
       With	  no	centralized	 hierarchy	 nor	 the	ability	  of	 any	locally	  renowned	or
learned	mullah	to	start	a	madrassa,	the	Deobandi	 tradition	 resulted	in	dozens	of

123
breakaway,	extremist	 factions	 emerging	out	 of	 the	mainstream	 JUI.	 The	most
important	 breakaway	 faction	  of	 the	 JUI	  is	 led	 by	 Maulana	  Samiul	 Haq,	 a
religious	and	political	 leader	who	 has	been	a	Member	of	the	National	 Assembly
and	a	 Senator	and	 whose	madrassa	 became	a	 major	 training	 ground	 for	 the
Taliban	 leadership.	In	 1999	 at	 least	eight	 Taliban	 cabinet	 ministers	 in	 Kabul
were	graduates	of	 Haq's	 Dar-ul-Uloom	  Haqqania	 and	dozens	 more	graduates
served	as	Taliban	governors	in	 the	provinces,	military	  commanders,	judges	and
bureaucrats.15	Younis	Khalis	and	Mohammed	Nabi	 Mohammedi,	 leaders	of	the
traditional	Mujaheddin	 parties,	both	studied	at	Haqqania.
       Haqqania	is	 in	Akhora	 Khatak,	in	 the	NWFP.	It	 is	a	sprawling	collection	 of
buildings	on	the	main	Islamabad-Peshawar	highway.	It	 has	a	boarding	school	for
1,500	students,	a	high	 school	 for	 1,000	day	 students	and	12	 affiliated	 smaller
madrassas.	It	was	started	 in	1947	 by	Samiul	 Haq's	father	 Maulana	Abdul	  Haq
who	was	a	student	and	teacher	at	Deoband.	Haqqania	offers	an	eight-year	Master
of	 Arts	 course	in	 Islamic	 studies	 and	a	PhD	 after	 an	 additional	 two	 years	of
study.	Funded	by	public	donations	it	charges	its	students	nothing.
       In	  February	 1999,	the	 madrassa	 had	a	 staggering	 15,000	applicants	 for
some	400	new	places	making	it	the	most	popular	madrassa	in	northern	 Pakistan.
Samiul	Haq,	 a	jovial	 but	 pious	man	with	 a	 tremendous	sense	of	humour	and	 a
flowing	 red	hennaed	beard	told	me	that	his	madrassa	has	always	kept	some	400
places	for	Afghan	students.	Since	1991	60	students	are	accepted	from	Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan	and	 Kazakhstan	 who	 tend	to	 belong	 to	 the	 Islamic	 opposition	 in
these	countries	and	enter	Pakistan	without	passports	or	visas.
       Haq	 is	still	 bitter	about	how	he	was	ignored	 by	the	ISI	for	 so	long.	‘The	 ISI
always	supported	Hikmetyar	 and	Qazi	 Hussain	Ahmed	[leader	 of	the	 Jamaat-e-
Islami]	 while	  we	were	 ignored,	 even	though	 80	 per	 cent	of	 the	 commanders
fighting	 the	Russians	in	the	Pashtun	areas	had	studied	at	Haqqania,’	he	told	 me
as	we	sat	on	a	rough	carpet	in	his	office	surrounded	by	 bearded	students	holding
application	forms	 for	the	class	of	’99.16‘Hikmetyar	 had	5	per	cent	of	the	popular
support	 but	 90	 per	 cent	 of	  the	 military	  aid	 from	  the	 ISI.	  We	 were	 never
recognized	but,	 with	  the	arrival	  of	 the	Taliban,	  the	support	 of	 the	 people	of
Afghanistan	fell	 into	our	lap,’	 he	added	with	a	big	laugh.
       ‘Before	  1994	I	 did	 not	know	 Mullah	 Omar	 because	he	had	not	studied	 in
Pakistan,	but	those	around	him	 were	all	 Haqqania	students	and	came	to	see	me
frequently	to	discuss	what	to	do.	I	 advised	them	not	to	set	up	a	party	because	the
ISI	was	 still	 trying	 to	 play	 one	Mujaheddin	 party	 against	the	other	 in	order	 to
keep	them	divided.	 I	 told	them	 to	start	a	 student	movement.	When	 the	Taliban

124
movement	began	I	told	 the	ISI,	 “let	 the	students	take	over	 Afghanistan,”	 ’	 Haq
said.	Samiul	Haq	 has	deep	respect	for	 Mullah	 Omar.	 ‘I	 met	Omar	 for	 the	first
time	when	 I	went	 to	Kandahar	 in	1996	 and	I	was	 proud	that	 he	was	chosen	as
Amirul	 Momineen.	 He	has	no	money,	 tribe	or	 pedigree	but	he	is	revered	above
all	others	and	so	Allah	 chose	him	to	be	their	leader.	According	 to	Islam	 the	man
who	 can	bring	 peace	 can	be	 elected	the	 Amir.	  When	 the	 Islamic	 revolution
comes	to	Pakistan	it	will	  not	be	led	by	 the	old	defunct	 leaders	like	me,	but	by	 a
similiar	unknown	 man	who	will	 arise	from	the	masses.’
       Samiul	   Haq	 is	  in	  constant	  touch	 with	   Omar,	  helps	 him	  deal	  with
international	relations	and	offers	advice	on	important	 Sharia	decisions.	He	is	also
the	principle	 organizer	for	 recruiting	 Pakistani	students	to	fight	 for	 the	Taliban.
After	 the	 Taliban	 defeat	in	 Mazar	 in	 1997	 he	received	 a	telephone	call	 from
Omar	asking	for	 help.	 Haq	shut	down	 his	madrassa	and	sent	his	 entire	student
body	to	fight	 alongside	the	Taliban.	 And	after	the	battle	 for	Mazar	 in	1988,	Haq
organized	a	meeting	between	Taliban	leaders	and	12	madrassas	in	the	NWFP	to
organize	reinforcements	for	 the	Taliban	army.	 All	 the	madrassas	agreed	to	shut
down	 for	 one	 month	 and	 send	8,000	 students	to	  Afghanistan.	 The	 help	 the
Taliban	 receive	from	 Pakistan's	 Deobandi	madrassas	is	 an	 important	 level	 of
support	they	can	rely	upon,	quite	apart	from	 the	government	and	the	intelligence
agencies.
       Another	 JUI	faction	 runs	the	Jamiat-ul	Uloomi	 Islamiyyah	 in	Binori	 town,	a
surburb	of	 Karachi.	 It	 was	established	by	 the	late	 Maulvi	  Mohammed	Yousuf
Binori	 and	has	8,000	 students	including	 hundreds	of	 Afghans.	Several	 Taliban
ministers	have	 studied	there.	 It	 also	operates	with	 the	 help	of	 donations	 from
Muslims	 in	 45	countries.	 ‘The	 funding	 we	 get	is	 a	blessing	 from	 Allah,’	  said
Mufti	 Jamil,	 a	teacher.	‘We	are	proud	 that	we	teach	the	Taliban	 and	we	always
pray	for	their	success	as	they	have	managed	to	implement	strict	Islamic	laws,’	he
added.17	Binori	sent	600	students	to	join	the	Taliban	in	1997.	In	November	 1997
students	from	Binori	 went	 on	a	rampage	in	Karachi	 after	 three	of	their	 teachers
were	assasinated.	They	fought	the	police	and	smashed	vehicles,	video	shops	and
beat	up	 photographers.	It	  was	the	 first	 time	  that	Pakistan's	 largest	and	 most
cosmopolitan	city	had	experienced	Taliban-style	unrest.
       Another	 extreme	splinter	 faction	 of	the	JUI	 is	the	Sipah-e-Sahaba	Pakistan
(SSP),	the	most	virulent	 anti-Shia	 group	 in	Pakistan	which	 is	 supported	by	 the
Taliban.	When	 the	government	launched	 a	crackdown	 against	the	SSP	in	1998
after	hundreds	 of	 Shia	had	 been	massacred	by	 the	 SSP,	their	 leaders	fled	 to
Kabul	 where	 they	 were	 offered	  sanctuary.	Hundreds	 of	  SSP	militants	  have

125
trained	at	the	Khost	training	 camp	run	 by	the	Taliban	 and	Bin	Laden,	which	 the
US	hit	with	 cruise	missiles	 in	1998	and	thousands	of	SSP	members	have	fought
alongside	the	Taliban.
       The	 JUI	 were	 to	benefit	 immensely	 from	 their	 Taliban	 proteges.	 For	the
first	 time,	 the	 JUI	 developed	 international	 prestige	 and	influence	  as	a	 major
patron	of	Islamic	 radicalism.	Pakistani	 governments	and	the	ISI	could	 no	longer
ignore	the	party,	nor	could	 Saudi	Arabia	and	the	Arab	 Gulf	 states.	Camps	inside
Afghanistan	 which	 were	used	for	 military	  training	 and	 refuge	for	 non-Afghan
Mujaheddin,	and	which	 had	earlier	 been	run	by	 Hikmetyar,	 were	taken	over	by
the	Taliban	and	handed	over	to	JUI	groups	such	as	the	SSP.	In	1996	the	Tailiban
handed	over	Camp	Badr	 near	Khost	 on	the	Pakistan-Afghanistan	 border	 to	the
Harkat-ul-Ansar	 led	 by	 Fazlur	 Rehman	Khalil.	  This	 was	 another	JUI	 splinter
group,	known	  for	 its	 extreme	 militancy	 which	  had	sent	 members	to	 fight	  in
Afghanistan,	Kashmir,	 Chechnya	and	 Bosnia.18	The	camp	was	attacked	by	 US
cruise	missile	two	years	later.
       The	 links	between	the	Taliban	and	some	of	the	extreme	Pakistani	Deobandi
groups	are	solid	 because	of	the	common	 ground	 they	share.	Several	Deobandi
leaders	from	both	 sides	of	the	border	 originate	 from	the	 Durrani	 Pashtun	tribes
based	around	 Kandahar	and	 Chaman	 in	 Pakistan.	 The	Deobandi	  tradition	 is
opposed	to	tribal	and	feudal	 structures,	from	 which	stems	the	Taliban's	 mistrust
of	the	tribal	 structure	and	the	clan	chiefs	and	whom	 the	Taliban	have	eliminated
from	 any	leadership	 role.	Both	 are	 united	in	 their	 vehement	opposition	 to	 the
Shia	sect	 and	 Iran.	 Now,	  Pakistani	 Deobandis	 want	 a	 Taliban-style	 Islamic
revolution	in	 Pakistan.
       The	 Taliban	 have	clearly	 debased	the	 Deobandi	tradition	 of	 learning	 and
reform,	 with	 their	  ridigity,	  accepting	no	 concept	 of	 doubt	 except	 as	sin	 and
considering	 debate	 as	 little	  more	 than	 heresy.	 But	  in	 doing	  so	 they	 have
advanced	a	 new,	 radical	  and,	 to	 the	 governments	 of	  the	 region	 extremely
threatening,	 model	 for	  any	 forthcoming	   Islamic	 revolution.	   Hikmetyar	  and
Masud	are	not	 opposed	to	modernism.	 In	 contrast,	the	Taliban	 are	vehemently
opposed	to	modernism	and	have	no	desire	to	 understand	or	adopt	modern	ideas
of	progress	or	economic	development.
       The	Taliban	 are	poorly	tutored	in	 Islamic	and	Afghan	 history,	knowledge	of
the	Sharia	and	the	 Koran	and	 the	political	  and	theoretical	developments	 in	the
Muslim	 world	  during	 the	 twentieth	 century.	 While	  Islamic	 radicalism	  in	 the
twentieth	century	has	a	long	history	 of	 scholarly	writing	 and	debate,	the	Taliban
have	no	 such	historical	  perspective	or	 tradition.	  There	 is	 no	Taliban	  Islamic

126
manifesto	or	scholarly	 analysis	of	 Islamic	 or	Afghan	 history.	 Their	 exposure	to
the	radical	Islamic	 debate	around	the	world	 is	minimal,	 their	 sense	of	their	own
history	is	even	less.	This	has	created	an	obscurantism	which	allows	 no	room	 for
debate	even	with	fellow	Muslims.
       The	  Taliban's	 new	  model	 for	  a	 purist	  Islamic	  revolution	  has	 created
immense	repercussions,	in	Pakistan	and	to	 a	more	limited	 extent	 in	the	 Central
Asian	Republics.	Pakistan,	an	already	fragile	 state	beset	by	an	identity	 crisis,	an
economic	meltdown,	 ethnic	and	 sectarian	divisions	 and	a	rapacious	ruling	 elite
that	has	been	unable	to	provide	good	governance,	now	faces	the	spectre	of	a	new
Islamic	 wave,	led	 not	 by	 the	older,	 more	 mature	and	 accommodating	Islamic
parties	but	by	neo-Taliban	groups.
       By	 1998,	 Pakistani	Taliban	 groups	were	 banning	TV	 and	videos	 in	 towns
along	 the	 Pashtun	 belt,	 imposing	  Sharia	 punishments	 such	 as	 stoning	 and
amputation	in	 defiance	 of	 the	legal	 system,	killing	  Pakistani	 Shia	and	 forcing
people,	particularly	 women	 to	adapt	to	 the	Taliban	 dress	code	and	way	of	 life.
Pakistan's	support	for	the	Taliban	is	thus	coming	back	to	haunt	the	country	itself,
even	as	Pakistani	leaders	appear	to	be	oblivious	of	the	challenge	and	continue	to
support	the	Taliban.	In	Central	Asia,	 particularly	 Tajikistan	and	Uzbekistan,	neo-
Taliban	militants	 are	 being	hunted	by	 the	police	 in	 the	Ferghana	valley,	 which
borders	both	countries.
       The	 Taliban	 and	their	 supporters	present	the	Muslim	  world	 and	the	 West
with	 a	new	 style	of	 Islamic	 extremism,	 which	 rejects	all	 accommodation	 with
Muslim	 moderation	and	the	West.	The	Taliban's	 refusal	to	compromise	with	 the
UN	 humanitarian	 agencies	or	foreign	  donor	countries	 or	 to	 compromise	 their
principles	 in	 exchange	for	  international	 recognition	 and	 their	 rejection	 of	 all
Muslim	 ruling	elites	as	corrupt,	has	inflamed	the	debate	in	the	Muslim	 world	and
inspired	 a	 younger	 generation	 of	 Islamic	 militants.	  The	 Taliban	  have	given
Islamic	fundamentalism	 a	new	face	and	a	new	identity	 for	 the	next	millenium	  –
one	that	refuses	to	accept	any	compromise	or	political	system	except	their	own.

                        TALIBAN'S	          POLITICAL	           AND
                         MILITARY	          ORGANIZATION



	
If	 there	was	a	single	inspiration	and	hope	for	peace	amongst	ordinary	Afghans
after	the	Taliban	emerged,	it	was	the	fact	that	they	governed	through	a	collective
political	leadership,	which	was	consultative	and	consensus-building,	rather	than
dominated	by	one	individual.	The	Taliban	Shura	in	Kandahar	claimed	it	was
following	 the	 early	  Islamic	 model	 where	discussion	 was	followed	  by	 a
consensus	amongst	‘the	believers’	and	sensitivity	and	accessibility	to	the	public
were	deemed	important.	The	Shura	model	was	also	heavily	based	on	the	Pashtun
tribal	jirga	or	council	where	all	clan	chiefs	took	part	in	deciding	upon	important
issues	which	the	tribe	faced.	On	my	early	visits	to	Kandahar,	I	was	impressed
with	the	debates,	which	sometimes	went	on	all	night	as	commanders,	mullahs
and	ordinary	fighters	were	called	in	to	give	their	 views,	before	Mullah	Omar
took	a	decision.
       Many	Afghans	were	also	impressed	by	the	fact	that	initially	the	Taliban	did
not	demand	power	for	themselves.	Instead	they	insisted	they	were	restoring	law
and	order,	only	to	hand	over	power	to	 a	government	which	was	made	up	of
‘good	Muslims’.	However,	between	1994	and	the	capture	of	Kabul	in	1996,	the
Taliban's	decision-making	process	was	to	change	and	become	highly	centralized,
secretive,	dictatorial	and	inaccessible.
       As	Mullah	Omar	became	more	powerful	and	introverted,	declining	to	travel
to	see	and	understand	the	rest	of	the	country	and	meet	the	people	under	his
control,	 the	 movement's	power	 structure	developed	all	  the	 faults	 of	  the
Mujaheddin	and	communist	predecessors.	Moreover	after	1996,	the	Taliban
made	known	their	desire	to	become	the	sole	rulers	of	Afghanistan	without	the
participation	of	other	groups.	They	maintained	that	the	ethnic	diversity	of	the
country	was	sufficiently	represented	in	the	Taliban	movement	itself	and	they	set
out	to	conquer	the	rest	of	the	country	to	prove	it.
       The	initial	  hopes	generated	by	the	Taliban	were	a	 direct	 result	of	 the
degeneration	of	the	 former	 Mujaheddin	 leadership.	During	 the	 jihad,	 the

129
Mujaheddin	  leadership	  based	 in	  Peshawar	  was	 highly	   factionalized	   and
personalised.	The	parties	were	held	together	by	charismatic	leaders	and	warlords
rather	than	an	 organisation.	As	 the	war	 progressed	these	leaders	became	more
and	more	 dependent	on	 Western	supplied	 funds	 and	arms	 to	 keep	their	 field
commanders	and	guerrilla	fighters	 loyal.	They	 spent	much	of	their	 time	literally
buying	support	inside	Afghanistan,	while	 bickering	 with	each	other	in	Peshawar.
       Pakistan	only	 helped	fuel	 this	 process	of	disunity.	 General	Zia	 ul	Haq	 had
commanded	Pakistani	troops	 in	 Jordan	in	 1970	 and	had	helped	 King	 Hussein
crush	the	Palestinians.	He	had	seen	at	first	hand	the	threat	that	a	united	guerrilla
movement	posed	to	the	state	where	it	had	been	given	sanctuary.	By	 maintaining
a	 disunited	  movement	 with	   no	 single	  leader,	 Zia	  was	  able	 to	  keep	 the
Mujaheddin	 leaders	 obligated	  to	 Pakistan	 and	 Western	 largesse.	 But	 when
Islamabad	desperately	needed	 a	coherent	 Mujaheddin	 leadership	 to	 present	a
political	 alternative	to	 the	communist	 regime	in	Kabul	 in	 1989	as	Soviet	troops
withdrew,	 and	again	 in	 1992	as	 the	Najibullah	  regime	 collapsed,	the	 disunity
amongst	the	Peshawar-based	Mujaheddin	 leaders	was	too	 far	 gone	to	 mend	–
even	with	 significant	  bribes.	 This	 disunity	 was	 to	 have	a	 profound	 effect	 on
Afghanistan's	future	inability	 to	achieve	a	consensus	government.
       The	 second	element	in	 the	anti-Soviet	 resistance	leadership	were	the	 field
commanders,	who	became	increasingly	frustrated	by	the	disunity	 and	corruption
of	the	 Peshawar	leaders	and	the	ease	with	 which	 they	 were	held	 hostage	over
funds	and	weapons	supplies.	The	very	nature	and	hardship	of	the	war	demanded
that	they	cooperate	with	 each	other,	despite	 the	feuding	of	 their	 party	chiefs	 in
Peshawar.
       There	 was	a	passionate	desire	for	greater	structural	unity	 amongst	the	field
commanders.	Ismael	Khan	 organized	the	 first	 meeting	of	 field	 commanders	in
Ghor	province	 in	 July	 1987,	 which	 was	attended	by	 some	1,200	 commanders
from	 across	 Afghanistan.	  They	 adopted	 20	  resolutions	 of	  which	  the	 most
important	was	the	demand	that	they,	rather	than	the	Peshawar	leaders,	dictate	the
political	 movement.	‘The	 right	 of	determining	 the	future	destiny	 of	Afghanistan
lies	with	 the	heirs	of	the	 martyrs	and	with	 the	Muslims	 of	the	trenches,	who	 are
struggling	in	bloody	 fronts	and	are	ready	to	be	martyred.	Nobody	 else	is	allowed
to	make	decisions	determining	the	fate	of	the	nation.’1
       Some	 300	commanders	met	 again	in	 Paktia	province	 in	 July	 1990	and	in
Badakhshan	in	October.	However,	ethnicity,	 personal	rivalries	and	the	urge	to	be
the	first	into	 Kabul	 broke	down	 their	consensus	as	the	Mujaheddin	competed	to
seize	the	capital	 in	 1992.	 The	battle	 for	 Kabul	 brought	 the	 divisions	 between

130
north	 and	south	 and	Pashtuns	and	 non-Pashtuns	into	 the	 open.	Ahmad	  Shah
Masud's	 inability	    to	  compromise	  with	  Pashtun	  commanders	 opposed	  to
Hikmetyar,	 even	 as	Masud	 seized	 Kabul	 in	 1992,	 badly	 dented	 his	 political
reputation.	He	was	 never	to	regain	 the	trust	of	 Pashtuns,	until	after	 the	Taliban
had	conquered	the	north	in	1998.
       A	   third	  level	  of	  leadership	 within	   the	 resistance	 were	  the	 scholars,
intellectuals,	 businessmen	and	 technocrats	 who	 had	 escaped	from	  Kabul	  to
Peshawar.	Many	   remained	 independent	  advocating	 unity	   amongst	 all	  the
resistance	forces.	But	this	group	of	 educated	Afghans	was	never	given	a	serious
political	 role	by	 the	Peshawar	parties	nor	 by	Pakistan.	As	 a	consequence	many
left	  Peshawar	 for	   foreign	  countries,	  adding	  to	  the	  diaspora	  of	  Afghan
professionals.	They	became	marginal	in	influencing	 political	 events	at	home	and
when	they	 were	needed	after	 1992	to	 help	 rebuild	 the	country,	 they	 were	 not
available.2	The	Pashtun	ulema	and	madrassa	teachers	were	scattered	throughout
the	resistance	movement,	 some	 as	party	 leaders	in	  Peshawar,	others	as	 field
commanders,	but	they	formed	no	united,	powerful	 presence	within	the	resistance
and	even	their	individual	 influence	 had	waned	considerably	by	1992.	The	ulema
were	ripe	to	be	taken	over	by	a	Taliban	style	movement.
       When	  the	 Taliban	 emerged	 in	 1994	 only	  the	 old,	  bickering	 resistance
leadership	was	left	and	President	Burhanuddin	Rabbani	had	failed	to	 unite	them.
In	 the	 Pashtun	areas	there	 was	 a	total	  vacuum	 of	 leadership	 as	warlordism
gripped	the	south.	The	Taliban	rightly	 considered	the	former	Mujaheddin	 leaders
as	redundant	and	corrupt.	 Although	 the	Taliban	 revered	some	leaders	from	 the
ulema	who	were	 their	earlier	 mentors,	they	 gave	them	no	political	  role	in	 their
movement.	Nor	did	the	Taliban	 have	any	liking	for	 the	independent-minded	field
commanders,	whom	 they	 blamed	for	  the	débâcle	 of	 the	Pashtuns	after	 1992.
Important	field	 commanders	who	surrendered	to	the	Taliban	were	never	elevated
within	  the	 Taliban	 military	   structure.	 The	 Taliban	  also	 completely	 rejected
Afghan	 intellectuals	 and	technocrats,	as	they	 considered	them	 the	spawn	 of	 a
Western	or	Soviet-style	educational	system	which	they	detested.
       The	  Taliban's	  emergence	  thus	 coincided	   with	  a	  fortunate	  historical
juxtaposition,	 where	 the	disintegration	 of	 the	 communist	 power	 structure	was
complete,	the	 Mujaheddin	  leaders	were	 discredited	 and	 the	 traditional	  tribal
leadership	had	been	eliminated.	It	 was	relatively	  easy	for	the	 Taliban	to	 sweep
away	what	little	  of	the	old	 Pashtun	leadership	was	left.	 Thereafter,	from	 within
the	Pashtuns,	the	 Taliban	 faced	no	 possible	 political	  challenges	to	 their	 rule.
They	now	  had	the	 opportunity	 to	 build	  a	more	 tribal-democratic,	  grass-roots

131
organisation.	 Imbued	  with	  the	 legitimizing	   factor	  of	 Islam,	  it	  could	  have
responded	to	 the	 population's	  needs,	but	 the	 Taliban	  proved	 incapable	 and
unwilling	 to	do	this.
       At	 the	same	time,	they	refused	to	evolve	 a	mechanism	by	which	 they	could
include	 the	 representatives	of	 the	 non-Pashtun	ethnic	 groups.	 Their	 supreme
position	in	the	Pashtun	areas	could	not	be	duplicated	in	the	north	unless	they	had
the	flexibility	   to	unite	 the	complex	 mosaic	 of	 the	Afghan	 nation	 under	a	 new
style	of	collective	 leadership.	Instead,	what	the	Taliban	 ultimately	 created	was	a
secret	society	  run	 mainly	  by	  Kandaharis	 and	 as	 mysterious,	 secretive	 and
dictatorial	 in	its	 ways	 as	the	Khmer	 Rouge	of	 Cambodia	or	 Saddam	Hussein's
Iraq.
       The	 Taliban's	 apex	decision-making	 body	 was	 the	Supreme	Shura	 which
continued	to	be	based	in	Kandahar,	a	city	which	Mullah	 Omar	 has	left	only	once
(to	visit	  Kabul	 in	 1996)	 and	 which	 he	turned	 into	 the	 new	 power	 centre	for
Afghanistan.	  The	  Shura	 was	  dominated	  by	  Omar's	  original	  friends	   and
colleagues,	mainly	 Durrani	 Pashtuns,	who	came	to	 be	called	 the	‘Kandaharis’,
even	though	 they	hailed	 from	 the	 three	provinces	 of	 Kandahar,	Helmand	 and
Urozgan.	The	original	 Shura	was	made	up	of	ten	members,	(see	Appendix	2)	but
military	 commanders,	tribal	elders	and	ulema	took	part	in	Shura	meetings	so	that
it	remained	loose	and	amorphous	with	as	many	as	50	people	often	taking	part.
       Of	  the	ten	 original	 Shura	 members,	six	 were	Durrani	  Pashtuns	and	only
one,	Maulvi	Sayed	Ghiasuddin,	was	a	Tajik	 from	Badakhshan	(he	had	lived	for	a
long	time	 within	  the	Pashtun	belt).	 This	 was	sufficient	  as	long	 as	the	Taliban
were	advancing	in	the	Pashtun	belt	but	after	 the	capture	of	Herat	and	Kabul,	 the
Shura	became	totally	unrepresentative.	The	Kandahar	Shura	never	broadened	its
base	sufficiently	 to	 include	 Ghilzai	 Pashtuns	or	non-Pashtuns.	It	 has	remained
narrowly	 based	and	narrowly	  focused,	unable	to	 represent	the	 interests	of	 the
entire	nation.
       Two	 other	 Shuras	report	to	the	Kandahar	 Shura.	The	first	 is	the	cabinet	 of
acting	ministers	in	 Kabul	or	 the	Kabul	Shura.	The	second	is	the	military	  council
or	military	 Shura.	Out	 of	17	members	in	 the	Kabul	Shura	in	 1998,	at	least	eight
were	Durranis	 while	 three	 are	Ghilzais	 and	 only	 two	 were	 non-Pashtuns	(see
Appendix	 2).	  The	 Kabul	  Shura	deals	 with	  the	 day-to-day	 problems	  of	 the
government,	the	city	  and	the	Kabul	 military	  front,	 but	 important	 decisions	are
conveyed	to	the	Kandahar	Shura	where	decisions	are	actually	taken.	Even	minor
decisions	taken	by	 the	Kabul	 Shura	and	its	 chief	 Mullah	 Mohammed	 Rabbani,
such	as	permission	 for	 journalists	 to	travel	 or	 new	UN	  aid	projcts,	 have	been

132
frequently	 revoked	by	 the	Kandahar	 Shura.	It	 soon	became	impossible	 for	 the
Kabul	 Shura,	 which	  acted	 as	 the	 government	 of	  Afghanistan,	 to	  take	 any
decision	 without	   lengthy	  consultations	  with	  Kandahar,	  delaying	  decisions
interminably.
       In	 Kabul	  and	Herat	 and	later	 in	 Mazar	 –	none	 of	 which	 have	a	 Pashtun
majority	 –	 the	 Taliban's	 representatives	such	 as	the	 governor,	 mayor,	 police
chiefs	and	 other	senior	 administrators	 are	invariably	  Kandahari	 Pashtuns	who
either	do	 not	 speak	Dari,	 the	 lingua	 franca	of	 these	cities	 or	 speak	it	 poorly.
There	is	 no	 prominent	  local	 citizen	 in	  any	 of	 these	local	  Shuras.	The	 only
flexibility	  the	Taliban	 have	demonstrated	is	 in	their	 appointments	of	 governors
to	 the	 provinces.	 Of	  11	 governors	  in	 1998,	 only	  four	  were	 known	  to	 be
Kandaharis.3	In	 the	past	the	 governors	and	 senior	local	 officials	  were	 usually
drawn	from	the	local	 elite,	reflecting	 the	local	 ethnic	make-up	of	the	population.
The	Taliban	broke	with	 this	tradition	and	appointed	outsiders.
       However,	   the	 political	   powers	  of	  the	  Taliban	  governors	  have	 been
considerably	reduced.	The	 paucity	 of	 funds	 at	their	 disposal,	their	 inability	  to
carry	out	serious	economic	 development	or	 rehabilitate	refugees	returning	 from
Pakistan	and	Iran	 gave	governors	 even	less	 of	 a	political,	  economic	or	 social
role.	Mullah	  Omar	has	also	 kept	the	 governors	under	 control	 and	not	 allowed
them	to	build	 up	a	local	power	 base.	He	has	constantly	shifted	them	around	and
sent	them	back	to	the	battle	front	as	commanders.
       After	  the	Mazar	 defeat	in	 1997	there	 was	growing	 criticism	 from	  Ghilzai
Pashtun	commanders	that	they	were	not	being	consulted	on	military	and	political
issues,	despite	  the	 fact	  that	 they	  now	  provided	 the	  bulk	  of	  the	 military
manpower.	In	Mazar	the	Taliban	lost	 some	3,000	of	their	best	troops,	3,600	were
taken	prisoner	and	 ten	leaders	were	 killed	 or	 captured.	Thus	the	 Taliban	 were
forced	to	draw	 upon	new	recruits	from	 the	Ghilzai	 tribes	of	 eastern	Afghanistan
but	the	Taliban	were	 not	prepared	to	yield	 them	political	 power	or	 include	them
in	the	 Kandahar	Shura.	 Increasingly	 the	Ghilzais	 were	 not	 prepared	to	 accept
being	used	as	cannon	fodder	by	the	Taliban	and	resisted	recruitment.
       The	 military	  structure	of	 the	Taliban	 is	 shrouded	in	 even	greater	secrecy.
The	 head	of	 the	 armed	 forces	 is	 Mullah	  Omar	 although	  there	is	 no	  actual
definition	 of	his	position	 or	his	role.	Under	 Omar	there	is	a	chief	of	 general	staff
and	then	chiefs	of	 staff	for	 the	army	 and	air	force.	 There	are	at	least	four	 army
divisions	and	 an	armoured	division	 based	in	 Kabul.	 However,	there	is	 no	clear
military	  structure	 with	  a	 hierarchy	 of	  officers	 and	 commanders,	 while	  unit
commanders	are	constantly	  being	shifted	  around.	For	 example,	 the	 Taliban's

133
Kunduz	expeditionary	force,	 which	was	the	only	military	  group	in	the	north	after
the	1997	Mazar	débâcle,	saw	at	least	three	changes	of	command	in	three	months,
while	more	than	half	 the	troops	were	withdrawn	and	flown	 to	the	Herat	front	 and
replaced	by	less	experienced	Pakistani	and	Afghan	 fighters.	 The	military	  Shura
is	a	loose	body	 which	 plans	strategy	 and	can	implement	 tactical	decisions,	 but
appears	to	 have	no	 strategic	 decision-making	  powers.	 Military	  strategy,	 key
appointments	and	 the	allocation	  of	 funds	for	  offensives	 are	decided	 upon	by
Omar.
       Apart	  from	 the	 general	conscription	  enforced	by	 the	 Taliban,	 individual
commanders	from	 specific	  Pashtun	areas	are	 responsible	for	  recruiting	 men,
paying	them	and	looking	after	their	 needs	in	the	field.	They	acquire	the	resources
to	do	 so	–	 money,	fuel,	 food,	 transport,	 weapons	and	ammunition	  –	from	 the
military	 Shura.	There	is	a	constant	coming	and	going	as	family	 members	change
places	at	the	 front,	 allowing	  soldiers	to	 go	 home	for	 long	 spells.	 The	regular
Taliban	 army	has	 never	numbered	more	 than	 25,000	to	 30,000	 men	although
these	numbers	could	 be	rapidly	 increased	before	 new	offensives.	 At	 the	 same
time	Pakistani	madrassa	students,	who	by	1999	made	up	some	30	per	cent	of	the
Taliban's	 military	  manpower,	 also	 served	 for	 short	 periods	 before	 returning
home	and	 sending	 back	 fresh	 recruits.	 Nevertheless	 this	 haphazard	 style	 of
enlistment,	 which	 contrasted	 sharply	 with	 Masud's	 12,000	 to	 15,000	 regular
troops,	does	not	allow	for	a	regular	or	disciplined	 army	to	be	created.
       As	 such,	the	Taliban	fighters	 resemble	a	lashkar	or	 traditional	tribal	 militia
force,	 which	 has	 long	 historical	  antecedents	amongst	 the	 Pashtun	 tribes.	 A
lashkar	has	always	been	quickly	mobilized	 either	on	orders	of	 the	monarch	or	to
defend	a	tribal	  area	and	fight	 a	 local	 feud.	 Those	who	 joined	 a	lashkar	 were
strictly	 volunteers	who	 were	 not	paid	 salaries,	but	shared	in	 any	 loot	 captured
from	 the	enemy.	However,	 Taliban	 troops	were	 forbidden	 from	 looting	 and	in
the	early	 period	  they	 were	 remarkably	 disciplined	  when	 they	 occupied	 new
towns,	although	this	broke	down	after	the	1997	Mazar	defeat.
       The	 majority	  of	 Taliban	 fighters	 are	not	 paid	salaries	and	 it	 is	 up	to	 the
commander	to	pay	his	 men	an	adequate	sum	of	 money	when	 they	go	on	 home
leave.	Those	 who	 are	 paid	 regular	 salaries	 are	 the	 professional	 and	 trained
soldiers	drawn	 from	 the	former	 communist	 army.	 These	Pashtun	tank	 drivers,
gunners,	pilots	and	 mechanics	are	fighting	 more	as	mercenaries,	having	 served
in	the	armies	of	whoever	controls	Kabul.
       Several	 members	of	 the	military	  Shura	are	also	 acting	ministers,	 creating
even	greater	chaos	in	the	Kabul	administration.	Thus	Mullah	 Mohammed	Abbas,

134
the	Health	 Minister,	 was	the	 second-in-command	of	 the	Taliban	 expeditionary
force	trapped	in	 the	north	 after	the	1997	 Mazar	defeat.	He	 was	then	pulled	 out
and	sent	to	Herat	to	organize	another	offensive	and	finally	  returned	to	his	job	 as
Minister	six	 months	later	-leaving	UN	 aid	agencies	whom	he	was	dealing	with	in
consternation.	 Mullah	  Ehsanullah	  Ehsan,	 the	 Governor	  of	  the	 State	 Bank
commanded	an	elite	force	of	 some	1,000	Kandaharis,	ensuring	 his	financial	 job
received	little	 attention	 before	 he	was	killed	  in	 Mazar	in	 1997.	 Mullah	 Abdul
Razaq,	the	Governor	 of	 Herat	 who	 was	 captured	in	 Mazar	 in	 1997	 and	later
freed,	has	 been	leading	 military	   offensives	 all	 over	 the	 country	 since	 1994.
Almost	all	 the	members	of	the	Kandahar	and	Kabul	Shura,	except	for	 those	with
physical	 disabilities,	 have	acted	 as	military	  commanders	at	 some	time	 or	 the
other.
       In	  one	sense	this	 allows	  for	 remarkable	 flexibility	   amongst	the	 Taliban
hierarchy	as	they	all	act	both	 as	administrators	and	generals	and	this	keeps	them
in	touch	 with	 their	 fighters.	However,	 the	 Taliban	administration,	 especially	 in
Kabul,	 has	 suffered	 enormously.	 While	  a	 minister	  is	 away	 at	 the	 front	  no
decisions	can	 be	 taken	in	 the	 ministry.	  The	 system	ensured	 that	 no	Taliban
minister	 became	proficient	  in	 his	 job	 or	 created	a	 local	 power	 base	through
patronage.	Mullah	  Omar	  would	 send	 any	 minister	  who	  was	 becoming	 too
politically	 powerful	 back	to	 the	front	at	a	moment's	notice.	 But	the	result	of	 this
confusion	was	a	country	 without	 a	government	and	a	movement	without	 clearly
defined	leadership	roles.
       The	 Taliban's	  excessive	secrecy	has	 been	a	 major	 deterrent	 in	 winning
public	  confidence	 in	  the	  cities,	 the	  foreign	  media,	 aid	  agencies	 and	 the
international	community.	  Even	after	 they	captured	Kabul,	 the	 Taliban	declined
issuing	any	agenda	on	how	they	 intended	to	set	up	a	representative	government
or	foster	 economic	 development.	 For	 the	Taliban	  to	 insist	 upon	international
recognition	 when	there	 was	no	 clearly	 demarcated	government	only	 increased
the	 international	   community's	  doubts	  about	 their	   ability	  to	  govern.	  The
spokesman	of	the	Kabul	 Shura,	 Sher	Mohammed	Stanakzai,	 a	relatively	 suave
English-speaking	Ghilzai	 Taliban	from	 Logar	 province	who	 had	trained	in	India
as	a	policeman,	was	the	Taliban	conduit	for	 the	UN	aid	 agencies	and	the	foreign
media.	However	 it	 quickly	 became	apparent	that	 Stanakzai	had	no	 real	power
and	did	not	even	have	direct	access	to	Mullah	Omar	in	order	to	convey	messages
and	receive	an	 answer.	As	 a	 consequence	his	job	 became	meaningless	as	aid
agencies	never	knew	if	their	messages	were	even	reaching	Omar.
       The	  Taliban	  increased	the	  confusion	 by	  purging	 Kabul's	  bureaucracy,

135
whose	lower	levels	 had	remained	in	 place	since	1992.	The	 Taliban	replaced	all
senior	Tajik,	 Uzbek	and	Hazara	bureaucrats	with	Pashtuns,	whether	qualified	 or
not.	As	 a	result	 of	this	 loss	of	 expertise,	the	 ministries	 by	 and	large	ceased	to
function.
       Within	  the	ministries	the	Taliban's	work	 ethic	defied	 description.	No	matter
how	 serious	the	 military	  or	 political	 crisis,	 government	 offices	 in	  Kabul	 and
Kandahar	are	 open	for	  only	 four	 hours	 a	 day,	from	  8.00	 a.m.	to	 noon.	 The
Taliban	then	break	for	 prayers	and	a	long	afternoon	siesta.	Later,	they	have	long
social	gatherings	 or	meetings	 at	night.	 Ministers	 desks	are	 empty	 of	files	 and
government	offices	 are	 empty	 of	 the	public.	 Thus	 while	  hundreds	of	 Taliban
cadres	and	bureaucrats	were	involved	in	 a	drive	to	 force	the	male	population	 to
grow	long	beards,	nobody	was	available	to	 answer	queries	in	the	ministries.	The
public	 ceased	 to	 expect	 anything	  of	 the	 minstries	  while	  the	 lack	 of	  local
representation	in	urban	administrations	made	the	Taliban	appear	as	an	occupying
force,	rather	than	administrators	trying	to	win	 hearts	and	minds.
       The	 Taliban	 have	 to	 date	given	 no	 indication	 as	to	 how	 and	 when	 they
would	set	up	a	more	 permanent	representative	government,	whether	they	would
have	a	 constitution	 or	 not	 and	how	 political	  power	 would	 be	 divided.	 Every
Taliban	leader	 has	different	 views	 on	 the	subject.	 ‘The	 Taliban	 are	willing	  to
negotiate	with	 the	opposition,	 but	on	 the	one	condition	 that	 no	political	 parties
take	part	in	the	discussions.	Most	of	the	Taliban	have	come	from	 political	 parties
and	we	 know	 the	conflict	  they	 create.	Islam	 is	against	 all	 political	 parties,’	 a
minister	told	 me.	‘Eventually	  when	we	 have	peace	people	can	select	their	 own
government,	but	first	 the	opposition	 has	to	 be	disarmed,’	said	another	 minister.
Others	wanted	an	exclusive	Taliban	government.4
       After	  1996,	power	was	entirely	 concentrated	in	 the	hands	of	Mullah	  Omar
while	the	Kandahar	Shura	was	consulted	less	and	less.	Mullah	 Omar's	confidant
Wakil	 made	 this	apparent.	 ‘Decisions	 are	based	on	 the	 advice	of	  the	Amirul
Momineen.	For	 us	consultation	 is	not	 necessary.	We	believe	that	this	 is	in	 line
with	 the	Sharia.	We	abide	by	 the	Amir's	 view	 even	if	 he	alone	takes	this	 view.
There	will	  not	be	 a	head	of	 state.	Instead	there	will	  be	an	 Amirul	 Momineen.
Mullah	 Omar	will	  be	the	highest	authority	 and	the	government	will	  not	be	able
to	implement	 any	 decision	 to	 which	 he	does	not	 agree.	General	 elections	are
incompatible	with	 Sharia	and	therefore	we	reject	them.’5
       To	  implement	  his	  decisions	  Mullah	  Omar	  relied	  less	 on	  the	 Kabul
government	and	increasingly	upon	the	Kandahari	 ulema	and	the	religious	 police
in	 Kabul.	 Maulvi	  Said	 Mohammed	 Pasanai,	the	 Chief	 Justice	 of	 Kandahar's

136
Islamic	 Supreme	Court,	who	 had	taught	 Omar	the	 basics	of	Sharia	 law	during
the	jihad,	 became	a	key	adviser	to	 Omar.	He	 claimed	responsibility	  for	 ending
lawlessness	in	  the	 country	 through	  Islamic	  punishments.	 ‘We	  have	 judges
presiding	over	 13	High	  Courts	in	 13	provinces	 and	everywhere	 there	is	 peace
and	security	for	the	people,’	he	told	 me	in	1997.6	Pasanai,	who	is	in	his	80s,	said
that	he	had	 handed	out	Islamic	 punishments	 for	 nearly	half	 a	 century	in	 local
villages	and	guided	the	Mujaheddin	in	applying	 Sharia	during	the	jihad.
       The	 Kandahar	Islamic	 Supreme	Court	became	the	most	 important	court	 in
the	country	  because	of	 its	 proximity	  to	 Omar.	 The	 Court	 appointed	 Islamic
judges,	Qazis,	and	 Assistant	Qazis	 in	 the	provinces	 and	 once	or	 twice	 a	year
assembled	them	all	in	 Kandahar	 to	discuss	cases	and	the	application	 of	 Sharia
law.	 A	  parallel	 system	 exists	 in	 Kabul	  where	 the	 Justice	Ministry	   and	 the
Supreme	Court	 of	 Afghanistan	 are	based.	The	 Kabul	 Supreme	 Court	 handles
about	40	cases	a	week	 and	comprises	eight	 departments	which	 deal	with	 laws
related	to	commerce,	 business,	criminal	 and	public	 law,	 but	it	 clearly	 does	not
have	the	same	powers	as	the	Kandahar	Supreme	Court.	 According	 to	 Attorney
General	Maulvi	   Jalilullah	  Maulvizada,	 ‘All	   the	 laws	 are	 being	 Islamicized.
Those	laws	repugnant	to	Islam	 are	being	removed.	It	 will	 take	several	years	for
us	to	go	through	all	the	old	laws	and	change	or	remove	them.’
       The	  worsening	 economic	  situation	 and	 political	   alienation	 in	  Taliban-
controlled	 areas	along	 with	 the	 massive	 military	  losses	they	 suffered,	 led	 to
increasing	internal	 divisions.	 In	 January	1997,	the	 Taliban	 faced	a	revolt	 from
within	 the	 Kandahar	heartland	 over	forced	 conscription.	 At	 least	 four	 Taliban
recruiters	were	 killed	 by	 villagers	 who	 refused	 to	join	  the	army.	 The	Taliban
were	driven	out	 from	several	villages	 around	Kandahar	after	gunfights	 in	which
there	were	casualties	on	 both	 sides.7	Village	 elders	said	 that	their	 young	 men
faced	death	if	 they	joined	 the	 army.	‘The	 Taliban	 had	promised	 peace,	instead
they	have	given	us	nothing	but	war,’	 said	one	village	elder.8	In	June,	the	Taliban
executed	18	army	 deserters	in	 Kandahar	jail.9	 There	 were	similar	  movements
against	conscription	 in	 Wardak	 and	Paktia	 provinces.	Forced	 conscription	 has
increased	the	Taliban's	unpopularity	and	forced	them	to	draw	more	 upon	recruits
from	Pakistani	madrassas	and	Afghan	refugees	settled	there.
       Meanwhile	 the	simmering	 differences	between	the	Shuras	in	Kandahar	and
Kabul	escalated	dramatically	 in	 April	 1998	 after	the	visit	 of	 the	US	 envoy	Bill
Richardson	to	Kabul.	 Mullah	  Rabbani,	the	head	of	 the	 Kabul	 Shura,	agreed	to
implement	 Richardson's	 point	 agenda,	 but	 the	 next	 day	 the	 agreement	 was
rejected	by	  Mullah	  Omar	 from	 Kandahar.	 Rabbani	 went	 off	  on	 one	 of	 his

137
periodic	 long	 leaves	and	there	 were	rumours	 he	was	 under	arrest.	In	 October
1998,	the	Taliban	arrested	over	60	people	in	Jalalabad,	the	largest	city	in	 eastern
Afghanistan,	claiming	 there	was	 a	coup	attempt	by	 ex-military	 officers	 loyal	 to
General	 Shahnawaz	Tanai,	 the	  Pashtun	general	 who	  in	 1990	  had	 deserted
Najibullah's	  army	  and	  joined	  the	  Mujaheddin.	  His	  Pashtun	 officers	   had
supported	the	Taliban	 since	 1994	 and	many	 served	in	 the	Taliban	 army.10	In
December	the	Taliban	shot	a	student	dead	and	wounded	several	others	during	 a
disturbance	at	the	medical	faculty	 of	 Nangarhar	University	 in	 Jalalabad.	Strikes
and	anti-Taliban	protests	took	place	in	the	city.
       The	 growing	discontent	in	 Jalalabad	appeared	to	be	instigated	by	supporters
of	the	more	moderate	Mullah	 Rabbani,	who	had	built	 a	political	 base	in	the	city.
Jalalabad's	powerful	 traders	 who	 ran	the	 smuggling	 trade	 from	 Pakistan	 also
wanted	a	more	 liberal	 attitude	 from	 the	 Taliban.	 After	 the	Jalalabad	incidents
Mullah	  Rabbani	  was	 once	  again	  recalled	 from	   Kabul	  to	  Kandahar	  and
disappeared	from	view	 for	several	months.	By	 1998,	the	 Kabul	Shura	was	keen
to	moderate	Taliban	 policies	 so	 that	UN	 agencies	could	 return	 to	Afghanistan
and	greater	international	aid	flow	  to	the	cities.	 Taliban	leaders	in	the	Kabul	 and
Jalalabad	Shuras	were	feeling	the	growing	public	discontent	at	rising	 prices,	lack
of	food	 and	the	 cut-back	in	 humanitarian	 aid.	However,	 Mullah	  Omar	and	the
Kandahar	leadership	 refused	to	 allow	  an	expansion	 of	 UN	 aid	 activities	  and
eventually	forced	the	UN	to	 quit.
       In	 the	winter	 of	 1998-99	there	were	several	acts	of	 looting	 and	robbery	by
Taliban	  soldiers,	 reflecting	   the	 growing	   indiscipline	  caused	 by	  economic
hardship.	In	  the	worst	  such	incident	  in	 Kabul	  in	 January	1999,	 six	 Taliban
soldiers	had	their	right	 arms	and	left	 feet	amputated	for	 looting.	 The	authorities
then	hung	the	amputated	limbs	from	 trees	in	the	city	 centre	where	they	could	be
seen	by	 the	 public	 until	  they	 rotted.	 Although	 internal	  differences	 increased
speculation	about	serious	weakness	within	 the	 Taliban,	which	 could	 lead	to	 an
intra-Taliban	 civil	  war,	 Mullah	 Omar's	 exalted	position	 and	 increased	powers
allowed	him	to	keep	total	control	 of	the	movement.
       Thus	 the	 Taliban,	like	  the	Mujaheddin	 before	 them,	had	 resorted	to	 one-
man	rule	with	no	organizational	 mechanism	to	accommodate	other	ethnic	groups
or	points	 of	 view.	 The	 struggle	 between	moderate	and	 hardline	 Taliban	 went
underground	with	 no	Taliban	 leader	willing	  to	contradict	 Omar	or	 oppose	him.
Such	a	situation	is	 more	than	likely	  to	lead	to	 an	eventual	explosion	 within	 the
Taliban	 –	 an	intra-Taliban	  civil	  war,	 which	  can	 only	 once	 again	divide	  the
Pashtuns	and	bring	more	suffering	to	the	common	people.

                           WOMEN,	        CHILDREN	          AND
                                   TALIBAN	        CULTURE



	
Nobody	ever	wants	to	see	the	inside	of	Maulvi	Qalamuddin's	sparse	office	in
the	centre	of	Kabul.	Half	the	population	never	will	anyway,	because	the	Maulvi
does	not	allow	women	to	even	enter	the	building.	A	 huge	Pashtun	tribesman
with	enormous	feet	and	hands,	a	long	thick	nose,	black	eyes	and	a	bushy	black
beard	that	touches	his	desk	while	he	talks,	Qalamuddin's	physique	and	name
generate	fear	across	the	city.	As	head	of	the	Taliban's	religious	police,	the	stream
of	regulations	he	issues	from	this	office	has	dramatically	changed	the	lifestyle	of
Kabul's	once	easy-going	population	and	forced	Afghan	women	to	 disappear
entirely	from	public	view.
       Maulvi	Qalamuddin	runs	the	Amar	Bil	Maroof	Wa	Nahi	An	al-Munkar,	or
the	Department	of	the	Promotion	of	Virtue	and	Prevention	of	Vice.	He	himself
prefers	the	translation	as	Department	of	Religious	Observances.	In	the	streets,
people	just	call	the	department's	thousands	of	young	zealots,	who	walk	around
with	whips,	long	 sticks	and	kalashnikovs,	the	religious	police	and	even	more
derogatory	names.	The	day	I	visited	him	for	a	rare	interview	in	the	summer	of
1997,	he	had	just	issued	new	regulations	which	banned	women	from	wearing
high	heels,	making	a	noise	with	their	shoes	while	they	walked	or	wearing	make-
up.	‘Stylish	dress	and	decoration	of	women	in	hospitals	is	forbidden.	Women	are
duty-bound	to	behave	with	dignity,	to	walk	calmly	and	refrain	from	hitting	their
shoes	on	the	ground,	which	makes	noises,’	the	edict	read.	How	the	zealots	could
even	see	women's	make-up	or	their	shoes,	considering	that	all	women	were	now
garbed	in	the	head	to	toe	burkha	was	mystifying	(see	Appendix	1).
       The	new	edict	formalized	previous	restrictions	on	disallowing	women	from
working,	but	it	now	also	banned	them	from	working	for	Western	humanitarian
aid	agencies,	except	in	the	medical	sector.	‘Women	are	not	allowed	to	work	in
any	field	 except	the	medical	sector.	Women	working	 in	 the	 medical	sector
should	not	sit	in	the	seat	next	to	the	driver.	No	Afghan	woman	has	the	right	to	be
transported	in	the	same	car	as	foreigners,’	the	edict	continued.	Education	for

140
boys	is	also	at	a	standstill	in	Kabul	because	most	of	the	teachers	are	women,	who
now	 cannot	 work.	 An	  entire	 generation	of	  Afghan	 children	  are	growing	  up
without	 any	 education.	 Thousands	of	  educated	families	 have	 fled	 Kabul	  for
Pakistan	simply	beause	their	children	can	no	longer	receive	an	education.
       I	 nervously	 asked	Qalamuddin	 what	justified	 the	 Taliban's	ban	on	 women
from	working	 and	going	to	school.	‘We	 will	 be	blamed	by	our	 people	if	we	don't
educate	women	and	we	will	 provide	 education	for	them	 eventually,	but	 for	now
we	have	serious	 problems,’	 he	replied.	 Like	 so	 many	mullahs	 and	 despite	his
size,	he	is	surprisingly	 soft-spoken	and	I	 strained	to	catch	his	 words.	‘There	 are
security	problems.	There	are	no	provisions	for	separate	transport,	separate	school
buildings	 and	 facilities	 to	 educate	 women	 for	 the	 moment.	 Women	 must	be
completely	segregated	from	men.	And	 within	 us	we	have	those	men	who	cannot
behave	properly	with	 women.	We	lost	 two	million	  people	in	the	war	 against	the
Soviets	because	we	had	no	Sharia	law.	We	fought	for	 Sharia	and	now	this	is	 the
organization	 that	 will	   implement	 it.	  I	  will	  implement	  it	  come	 what	 may,’
Qalamuddin	said	emphatically.
       When	 the	 Taliban	 first	 entered	Kabul,	 the	 religious	 police	 beat	 men	and
women	in	 public	 for	not	 having	long	 enough	beards	or	not	 wearing	the	 burkha
properly.	‘We	 advise	our	 staff	not	to	 beat	people	on	the	streets.	We	only	 advise
people	how	to	behave	according	to	the	Sharia.	For	 example,	if	 a	person	is	about
to	reverse	his	car	 into	 another	car,	then	we	 just	warn	 you	not	 to	 reverse	now,’
Qalamuddin	 said	 with	 a	 broad	 grin	 on	 his	 face,	 obviously	 pleased	 with	 his
modern	metaphor.
       The	 Department	is	modelled	on	a	similar	 government	organisation	 in	Saudi
Arabia	and	it	 has	recruited	thousands	of	young	 men,	many	of	 them	with	 only	 a
minimum	  madrassa	 education	  from	  Pakistan.	 The	 department	  is	 also	  the
Taliban's	most	effective	intelligence	 agency	–	a	bizarre	throwback	to	KHAD,	  the
enormous	intelligence	  agency	 run	  by	 the	 communist	  regime	 in	  the	 1980s.
KHAD,	  which	 later	 changed	its	 name	 to	 WAD,	  employed	 15,000	 to	30,000
professional	spies	as	well	having	100,000	paid	informers.1	Qalamuddin	admitted
that	he	has	thousands	of	informers	in	the	army,	 government	ministries,	hospitals
and	Western	aid	agencies.	‘Our	staff	all	 have	experience	in	religious	issues.	And
we	are	an	 independent	organization	 and	we	don't	 take	advice	 from	 the	Justice
Ministry	 or	 the	Supreme	Court	 as	to	what	 we	should	 implement.	 We	obey	 the
orders	of	the	Amir	Mullah	 Mohammed	 Omar.’
       Qalamuddin's	  edicts	are	 broadcast	regularly	  on	 Radio	 Shariat	 (formerly
Radio	Kabul)	 and	cover	every	aspect	of	social	behaviour	 for	the	population	 (see

141
Appendix	 1).	  One	 addresses	public	  attendance	at	 sports	 events,	 which	  the
Taliban	had	initially	  banned.	‘All	  onlookers,	 while	 encouraging	the	 sportsmen,
are	asked	to	chant	Allah-o-Akbar	  [God	 is	 Great]	and	 refrain	from	 clapping.	 In
case	the	game	coincides	with	prayer	time,	 the	game	should	be	interrupted.	Both
the	players	and	spectators	should	offer	 prayers	in	 congregation,’	 said	the	edict.
Kite-flying,	  once	a	favourite	pastime	in	 the	spring	for	 Kabulis,	is	 still	 banned	as
are	all	sports	for	women.
       For	 the	Taliban	 anyone	questioning	these	edicts,	which	 have	no	validity	 in
the	Koran,	 is	 tantamount	to	 questioning	 Islam	 itself,	 even	though	 the	Prophet
Mohammed's	first	 task	was	to	emancipate	women.	 ‘The	 supreme,	unmistakable
test	of	Islam	 was	the	emancipation	of	 women,	first	 beginning	 to	be	proclaimed,
then	–	more	slowly	 –	on	 the	way	to	 be	achieved,’	said	Ferdinand	 Braudel.2	But
the	Taliban	 did	not	 allow	 even	Muslim	  reporters	to	question	 these	edicts	or	 to
discuss	interpretations	of	 the	 Koran.	 To	foreign	  aid-workers	 they	simply	 said,
‘You	 are	not	Muslim	  so	you	have	no	right	 to	 discuss	Islam.’	 The	Taliban	 were
right,	their	 interpretation	 of	Islam	 was	right	 and	everything	else	was	wrong	 and
an	expression	of	human	 weakness	and	a	lack	of	 piety.	 ‘The	 Constitution	 is	the
Sharia	so	we	don't	need	a	constitution.	People	love	Islam	and	that	is	why	they	all
support	the	Taliban	 and	appreciate	 what	we	 are	doing,’	 said	 Attorney	 General
Maulvi	 Jalilullah	Maulvizada.3
       However	 the	plight	 of	Afghan	women	 and	Afghan	society	as	a	whole	began
well	  before	 the	 Taliban	  arrived.	  Twenty	  years	 of	  continuous	 warfare	  has
destroyed	Afghan	civil	  society,	the	clan	 community	 and	family	 structure	 which
provided	 an	  important	  cushion	 of	  relief	  in	  an	  otherwise	 harsh	 economic
landscape.	Afghanistan	  has	one	 of	  the	 lowest	 rated	 indices	 for	  the	 human
condition	 in	the	 world.	 The	infant	 mortality	 rate	is	 163	deaths	per	1,000	 births
(18	per	cent)	the	highest	in	 the	world	 which	 compares	to	an	average	of	70/1000
in	other	 developing	 countries.	 A	 quarter	of	 all	 children	  die	before	 they	 reach
their	fifth	 birthday,	compared	to	one	tenth	that	number	in	developing	countries.
       A	   staggering	 1,700	  mothers	  out	  of	  100,000	  die	  giving	   birth.	  Life
expectancy	for	 men	and	women	 is	just	 43–44	years	old,	 compared	to	61	 years
for	people	in	 other	developing	countries.	Only	 29	per	cent	 of	the	population	 has
access	to	health	and	12	 per	cent	has	access	to	safe	 water,	compared	to	 80	per
cent	and	70	 per	cent	respectively	 in	 developing	 states.	Children	die	 of	 simple,
preventable	diseases	like	  measles	and	diarrhoea	 because	there	 are	no	 health
facilities	and	no	clean	water.4
       Illiteracy	  was	 a	major	 problem	 before	the	 Taliban	 appeared,	affecting	 90

142
per	cent	 of	 girls	 and	60	 per	 cent	of	 boys.	 There	 were	huge	 swathes	of	 rural
Afghanistan	where	 schools	had	been	destroyed	in	the	 war	and	not	 a	single	one
remained.	Thus	the	 Taliban's	gender	policies	 only	 worsened	an	ongoing	 crisis.
Within	 three	months	 of	the	 capture	of	Kabul,	 the	 Taliban	 closed	63	schools	in
the	city	 affecting	  103,000	girls,	  148,000	boys	 and	11,200	 teachers,	of	 whom
7,800	were	 women.5	 They	 shut	down	  Kabul	 University	  sending	home	 some
10,000	students	 of	 which	 4,000	 were	 women.	 By	 December	 1998,	 UNICEF
reported	that	 the	country's	 educational	 system	was	in	 a	 state	of	 total	 collapse
with	nine	in	 ten	girls	and	two	in	three	boys	not	enrolled	in	 school.6
       The	 Afghan	 people's	 desperate	plight	 was	largely	 ignored	 by	 the	outside
world.	Whereas	in	 the	1980s	the	war	in	 Afghanistan	 attracted	attention	and	aid,
the	moment	the	Soviets	withdrew	 their	 troops	in	1989,	 Afghanistan	dropped	off
the	radar	screen	of	world	 attention.	The	ever	 dwindling	 aid	from	 wealthy	 donor
countries,	which	did	 not	even	meet	the	minimum	 budgetary	 requirements	of	the
humanitarian	aid	effort,	became	a	scandal.
       In	 1996	the	UN	 had	requested	US$124	million	  for	its	 annual	humanitarian
aid	programme	to	 Afghanistan,	but	 by	the	end	 of	the	year,	 it	had	only	 received
US$65	million.	  In	1997	 it	 asked	for	US$133	 million	 and	 received	only	 US$56
million	 or	 42	per	 cent	and	the	following	  year	 it	 asked	for	US$157	 million	  but
received	only	 US$53	 million	  or	34	 per	cent.	 By	 1999	the	 UN	 had	drastically
scaled	down	its	request	to	just	 US$113	million.	  In	the	 words	of	 scholar	Barnett
Rubin:	‘If	 the	situation	 in	Afghanistan	 is	ugly	 today,	it	is	 not	because	the	people
of	Afghanistan	 are	ugly.	Afghanistan	 is	not	only	 the	mirror	 of	 the	Afghans:	it	 is
the	mirror	of	 the	world.	 “If	 you	 do	not	like	 the	image	in	the	mirror	 do	 not	break
the	mirror,	break	your	face,”	 says	an	old	Persian	proverb.’7
       When	 Kabul's	 women	looked	 at	themselves	in	 the	mirror,	 even	before	the
Taliban	captured	the	city,	 they	 saw	only	despair.	In	 1996	I	 met	Bibi	 Zohra	 in	a
tiny	bakery	 in	Kabul.	 She	was	a	widow	 who	 led	a	group	 of	young	 women	who
prepared	nan,	 the	 unleavened	 baked	 bread	every	  Afghan	 eats,	 for	 widows,
orphans	and	disabled	people.	Some	400,000	people	in	Kabul	 depended	on	these
bakeries	funded	 by	 the	WFP,	 which	  included	 25,000	 familes	 headed	by	 war
widows	 and	7,000	 families	 headed	by	 disabled	 men.	Zohra's	 mud	 shack	was
pockmarked	 with	  shrapnel	and	 bullet	  holes.	 It	 had	 first	  been	 destroyed	by
rockets	fired	  by	 Gulbuddin	  Hikmetyar's	 forces	 in	 1993,	 then	 shelled	 by	 the
Taliban	in	1995.
       With	 six	 children	and	her	parents	to	support	she	had	donated	part	of	the	tiny
plot	of	land	 where	her	house	once	stood	to	WFP	for	a	bakery.	‘Look	  at	my	face,

143
don't	you	 see	the	tragedy	of	 our	lives	 and	our	country	 marked	all	 over	 it?’	 she
said.	 ‘Day	  by	  day	 the	  situation	  is	 worsening.	  We	 have	  become	 beggars
dependent	on	  the	 UN	  to	 survive.	  It	  is	 not	 the	  Afghan	  way.	 Women	  are
exhausted,	depressed	and	devastated.	We	are	just	waiting	for	peace,	praying	for
peace	every	minute	of	the	day.’
       The	 plight	 of	 Bibi	  Zohra's	children	 and	other	 kids	 was	even	 worse.	At	 a
playground	set	up	by	Save	the	Children	in	 the	battered,	half-destroyed	Microyan
housing	 complex,	  rake-thin	  Afghan	  children	  played	  grimly	  on	  the	 newly
installed	 swings.	 It	  was	a	 playground	  littered	 with	  reminders	 of	 the	 war	  –
discarded	artillery	 shell	 cases,	a	destroyed	tank	 with	 a	 gaping	 hole	where	 the
turret	once	was	and	trees	lopped	down	by	rocket	fire.	 ‘Women	 and	children	face
the	brunt	of	 the	conflict,’	  Save	the	Children's	Director	 Sofie	 Elieussen	told	 me.
‘Women	have	to	 cope	with	 no	food	 and	malnutrition	 for	 their	children.	 Women
suffer	from	 hysteria,	 trauma	and	depression	because	they	don't	know	 when	the
next	rocket	attack	will	 come.	How	 can	children	 relate	to	a	mother's	discipline	 or
affection	when	 they	have	seen	adults	killing	  each	other	and	mothers	are	unable
to	provide	 for	their	 basic	needs?	There	is	so	much	stress	that	the	children	 don't
even	trust	each	other	and	parents	have	stopped	communicating	with	their	kids	or
even	trying	to	explain	what	is	 going	on,’	said	Elieussen.
       A	 UNICEF	 survey	 of	Kabul's	 children	conducted	by	 Dr	Leila	 Gupta	found
that	most	children	had	witnessed	extreme	violence	and	did	not	expect	to	survive.
Two-thirds	of	 the	children	interviewed	 had	seen	somebody	killed	by	a	rocket	and
scattered	corpses	or	body	parts.	More	than	70	per	cent	had	lost	a	family	member
and	no	longer	 trusted	adults.	 ‘They	 all	 suffer	 from	 flashbacks,	nightmares	and
loneliness.	Many	said	they	 felt	their	 life	 was	not	worth	 living	 anymore,’	said	Dr
Gupta.	Every	norm	 of	family	 life	 had	been	destroyed	in	the	war.	 When	children
cease	to	trust	their	parents	or	 parents	cannot	provide	security,	 children	 have	no
anchor	in	the	real	world.
       Children	 were	caught	up	in	the	war	on	a	greater	scale	than	in	any	other	civil
conflict	 in	the	world.	 All	  the	warlords	 had	used	boy	soldiers,	some	as	young	as
12	years	 old,	 and	 many	 were	orphans	 with	 no	 hope	 of	 having	 a	 family,	  an
education	or	 a	 job	 except	 soldiering.	 The	 Taliban	 with	  their	 linkages	 to	 the
Pakistani	madrassas	encouraged	thousands	of	children	to	enlist	and	fight.	 Entire
units	were	made	up	of	kids	as	loaders	for	artillery	 batteries,	ammunition	 carriers,
guarding	installations	and	as	fighters.	Significantly	 a	major	international	 effort	 in
1998	to	limit	 the	age	of	soldiers	to	18,	rather	than	the	current	minimum	age	of	15
met	with	resistance	by	the	US,	Pakistan,	Iran	and	Afghanistan.	 A	 1999	Amnesty

144
International	report	 said	there	were	 over	300,000	 children	 under	18	enlisted	 as
soldiers	worldwide.8	 The	plight	 of	 women	and	 children	would	 get	much	 worse
after	the	Taliban	capture	of	Kabul.
       Every	  Kabuli	 woman	 I	 met	 during	 1995–96	 –	 and	 reporters	could	 then
easily	meet	and	talk	 to	women	 on	the	 street,	in	shops	and	offices	 –	 knew	their
precarious	lives	would	 only	 get	worse	 if	the	 Taliban	captured	Kabul.	 One	 such
woman	was	Nasiba	Gul,	 a	striking	27-year-old	 single	woman	 who	aspired	to	be
part	of	the	modern	world.	 A	1990	graduate	of	Kabul	University,	  she	held	down	a
good	job	  with	 an	 NGO.	 Dressed	 in	 a	 long	 skirt	  and	high	  heels,	she	 rarely
bothered	to	cover	her	 face,	throwing	 just	 a	small	scarf	 over	her	head	when	 she
travelled	across	the	city.	‘The	 Taliban	just	 want	to	trample	 women	into	the	dust.
No	woman,	not	 even	the	poorest	or	most	conservative	wants	the	 Taliban	to	rule
Afghanistan,’	 said	 Nasiba.	 ‘Islam	 says	 women	are	 equal	 to	 men	and	 respect
should	be	given	to	 women.	But	 the	Taliban's	 actions	are	turning	 people	against
even	Islam,’	  she	added.	 Nasiba's	 fears	were	 justified,	  for	  when	 the	Taliban
captured	Kabul,	 women	 disappeared	from	 public	  view.	 Nasiba	was	 forced	 to
stop	working	and	left	for	 Pakistan.
       The	 Taliban	leaders	were	all	 from	 the	poorest,	most	conservative	and	least
literate	 southern	Pashtun	provinces	 of	 Afghanistan.	 In	 Mullah	  Omar's	 village
women	had	always	gone	around	fully	 veiled	and	no	girl	 had	ever	gone	to	school
because	there	were	none.	Omar	and	his	colleagues	transposed	their	own	milieu,
their	 own	 experience,	 or	 lack	 of	 it,	  with	 women,	  to	 the	entire	  country	 and
justified	their	 policies	through	 the	Koran.	For	 a	time,	some	aid	agencies	claimed
that	this	 was	the	Afghan	 cultural	 tradition	 which	 had	to	 be	respected.	But	 in	a
country	 so	 diverse	in	  its	 ethnicity	 and	 levels	 of	 development,	 there	 was	 no
universal	standard	of	 tradition	 or	 culture	 for	 women's	role	 in	 society.	Nor	 had
any	 Afghan	 ruler	  before	 the	 Taliban	  ever	 insisted	 on	 such	 dress	codes	 as
compulsory	beards	for	men	and	the	burkha.
       The	 rest	 of	 Afghanistan	  was	 not	 even	remotely	  like	 the	 south.	 Afghan
Pashtuns	in	the	 east,	heavily	 influenced	 by	 Pakistani	Pashtuns,	were	 proud	to
send	their	girls	  to	school	 and	many	 continued	 to	do	 so	under	 the	Taliban,	 by
running	village	 schools	or	 sending	their	families	 to	 Pakistan.	Here	aid	 agencies
such	as	 the	 Swedish	 Committee	 supported	 some	 600	 primary	  schools	 with
150,000	 students	 of	 whom	  30,000	 were	  girls.	 When	  Pashtun	 tribal	  elders
demanded	education	for	girls,	 Taliban	 governors	did	 not	and	could	 not	object.9
In	Afghan	 refugee	camps	in	Pakistan	tens	of	thousands	of	Pashtun	girls	 studied.
Outside	the	Pashtun	belt,	all	 other	 ethnic	groups	vigorously	 encouraged	female

145
education.	Afghanistan's	 strength	 was	 its	 ethnic	 diversity	 and	 women	 had	as
many	roles	as	there	were	tribes	and	nationalities.
       Afghanistan's	  cities	  were	 even	 more	 diverse.	 Kandahar	  was	 always	 a
conservative	 city	  but	 Herat's	 female	  elite	 once	 spoke	 French	 as	 a	 second
language	and	copied	the	fashions	of	the	Shah's	court	in	Tehran.	Forty	per	cent	of
Kabul's	women	 worked,	 both	 under	the	 communist	 regime	 and	the	 post-1992
Mujaheddin	government.	 Women	with	 even	a	smattering	of	education	and	a	job
exchanged	their	traditional	clothes	for	 skirts,	high	heels	and	make-up.	They	went
to	the	movies,	 played	sports	and	danced	and	sang	at	weddings.	 Common	sense
alone	should	have	dictated	that	to	win	 hearts	and	minds,	the	Taliban	would	have
to	relax	their	 gender	policy	 according	to	the	 prevalent	realities	in	 the	areas	they
took	control	 of.	 Instead	they	 viewed	 Kabul	 as	a	den	of	 iniquity,	  a	Sodom	and
Gomorrah	 where	  women	 had	 to	  be	 beaten	 into	  conforming	  with	  Taliban
standards	of	 behaviour.	And	  they	viewed	 the	 northerners	 as	impure	 Muslims
who	had	to	be	forcibly	 re-Islamicized.
       The	  Taliban's	 uncompromising	  attitude	 was	 also	 shaped	 by	 their	  own
internal	political	 dynamic	 and	the	nature	of	their	recruiting	 base.	Their	recruits	–
the	orphans,	the	rootless,	 the	lumpen	 proleteriat	 from	 the	war	 and	the	 refugee
camps	–	had	been	bought	up	 in	a	totally	  male	society.	In	 the	madrassa	milieu,
control	 over	 women	  and	their	  virtual	  exclusion	 was	 a	 powerful	  symbol	 of
manhood	and	a	reaffirmation	  of	the	 students‘	commitment	 to	 jihad.	Denying	 a
role	 for	 women	 gave	 the	 Taliban	 a	 kind	  of	 false	 legitimacy	  amongst	these
elements.	‘This	  conflict	 against	 women	 is	 rooted	 in	 the	 political	  beliefs	 and
ideologies,	not	in	 Islam	or	the	cultural	 norms.	The	Taliban	 are	a	new	generation
of	Muslim	  males	who	 are	products	of	 a	war	 culture,	 who	 have	spent	much	 of
their	adult	lives	 in	complete	segregation	from	their	 own	communities.	In	 Afghan
society,	women	 have	traditionally	  been	 used	as	instruments	to	 regulate	 social
behaviour,	and	as	such	are	powerful	symbols	in	Afghan	culture,’	 said	Simi	 Wali,
the	head	of	an	Afghan	NGO.10
       Taliban	 leaders	repeatedly	told	me	that	if	they	gave	women	greater	freedom
or	a	chance	to	go	 to	school,	 they	would	 lose	the	support	 of	their	 rank	 and	file,
who	would	  be	disillusioned	  by	 a	leadership	 that	had	 compromised	 principles
under	 pressure.	 They	 also	 claimed	  their	  recruits	 would	  be	  weakened	and
subverted	by	the	 possibility	 of	 sexual	opportunities	 and	thus	not	 fight	 with	 the
same	zeal.	So	the	oppression	of	 women	became	a	benchmark	 for	 the	Taliban's
Islamic	radicalism,	 their	aim	 to	‘cleanse’	society	 and	to	keep	the	morale	of	 their
troops	 high.	 The	  gender	 issue	became	 the	 main	  platform	  of	 the	 Taliban's

146
resistance	to	UN	and	Western	governments’	attempts	to	make	them	compromise
and	moderate	their	 policies.	 Compromise	with	 the	 West	would	 signal	 a	defeat
that	they	were	wrong	all	along,	defiance	would	 signal	victory.
       Hardline	  Taliban	 turned	 the	 argument	of	 the	 outside	 world	 on	 its	 head.
They	 insisted	 that	  it	  was	 up	 to	  the	 West	 to	  moderate	 their	 position	  and
accommodate	the	 Taliban,	  rather	 than	 that	 the	 Taliban	  recognize	 universal
human	rights.	‘Let	  us	state	what	sort	 of	education	 the	UN	 wants.	This	 is	a	 big
infidel	 policy	which	 gives	such	obscene	freedom	to	women	which	 would	lead	to
adultery	 and	 herald	 the	destruction	  of	 Islam.	 In	  any	 Islamic	 country	  where
adultery	becomes	common,	that	country	 is	destroyed	and	 enters	the	domination
of	the	infidels	 because	their	men	become	like	women	and	women	cannot	defend
themselves.	Anybody	 who	 talks	to	 us	should	 do	so	 within	 Islam's	 framework.
The	Holy	Koran	 cannot	adjust	itelf	 to	other	people's	requirements,	people	should
adjust	themselves	to	the	requirements	of	the	Holy	Koran,’	 said	Attorney	 General
Maulvi	 Jalilullah	  Maulvizada.11	The	 Taliban	 could	 not	 explain	 how	 a	deeply
rooted	religion	like	 Islam	could	be	so	undermined	at	the	hands	of	adulterers.
       All	  tribal	Pashtuns	also	followed	 Pashtunwali,	a	social	code	which	gave	the
tribal	 jirga	 or	 council	 the	right	 to	 make	judgments	on	 cases	from	a	 traditional
pantheon	of	 laws	 and	punishments,	 especially	 when	it	 came	 to	 disputes	over
ownership	of	 land	 and	women	and	 murder.	The	 line	 between	Pashtunwali	and
Sharia	law	has	always	been	blurred	for	 the	Pashtuns.	Taliban	punishments	were
in	fact	 drawn	largely	 from	 Pashtunwali	rather	 than	the	Sharia.	But	 Pashtunwali
was	practised	in	varying	 degrees,	to	a	lesser	or	greater	extent	across	the	Pashtun
belt	and	it	certainly	 did	not	 govern	the	practices	of	other	ethnic	 groups.	The	fact
that	the	 Taliban	 were	 determined	to	 impose	 Pashtunwali-Sharia	law	  on	these
ethnic	groups	 by	 force	 only	 deepened	the	ethnic	 divide	  in	 the	country.	 Non-
Pashtuns	saw	this	is	an	attempt	to	impose	Kandahari	 Pashtun	laws	on	the	entire
country.
       There	 were	no	 political	 conditions	 in	 which	 the	Taliban	 were	 prepared	to
compromise.	After	  every	 military	  defeat	 they	 tightened	 their	 gender	policies
ferociously,	 under	the	assumption	that	 harsher	measures	against	women	would
sustain	morale	amongst	their	defeated	soldiers.	And	every	 victory	 led	to	another
tightening	 because	the	newly	 conquered	populations	 had	to	 be	shown	 Taliban
power.	The	policy	 of	 ‘engagement’	 with	 the	Taliban	to	 moderate	their	policies,
advocated	 by	 the	  international	  community,	  gave	 no	  dividends.	  And	  their
insistence	that	 they	 would	  allow	 women's	 education	 after	 the	 war	 was	over
became	more	and	more	meaningless.	The	capture	of	Herat	in	 1995	was	the	first

147
indicator	  to	 Afghans	  and	  the	 outside	  world	  that	  the	 Taliban	   would	  not
compromise	on	the	gender	issue.	Herat,	the	heart	of	medieval	Islam	 in	the	entire
region,	was	 a	 city	 of	 mosques	and	 madrassas,	but	 it	 had	an	 ancient,	liberal,
Islamic	tradition.	 It	 was	the	home	of	 Islamic	 arts	and	crafts,	miniature	 painting,
music,	dance,	 carpet-making	 and	numerous	 stories	 about	its	 redoubtable	 and
beautiful	women.
       Heratis	 still	 recount	the	 story	of	 Queen	Gowhar	Shad,	the	daughter-in-law
of	 the	conquerer	 Taimur	 who	 moved	the	 Timurid	  capital	 from	 Samarkand	to
Herat	in	  1405	after	 Taimur's	  death.	One	 day	 in	 the	 company	 of	 200	 ‘ruby-
lipped’,	beautiful	 ladies-in-waiting,	 the	Queen	inspected	a	mosque	and	madrassa
complex	she	was	building	 on	 the	outskirts	of	 Herat.	The	 madrassa	students	(or
taliban)	  had	 been	asked	 to	  vacate	the	  premises	while	  the	 Queen	 and	 her
entourage	visited,	but	one	student	had	fallen	asleep	in	his	room.	 He	was	awoken
by	an	exquisitely	  attractive	lady-in-waiting.	  When	 she	rejoined	 the	Queen,	the
lady	was	panting	and	dishevelled	by	the	exertions	of	passionate	love-making	and
thus	she	was	 discovered.	 Instead	of	 punishing	 her	 or	 the	 student,	the	 Queen
ordered	all	her	ladies-in-waiting	 to	 marry	the	students	in	a	mass	ceremony	so	as
to	bless	them	and	 ensure	they	avoided	temptation	 in	 the	future.	 She	gave	each
student	clothes	and	a	salary	and	ordered	that	husband	and	wife	should	meet	once
a	week	 as	 long	 as	 the	 students	studied	 hard.	 It	 was	 the	 kind	  of	 story	 that
epitomized	 the	 liberal,	 human	 tradition	 of	  Islam	 and	 madrassa	education	 in
Herat.
       The	 Taliban	had	no	knowledge	of	 Herat's	history	or	traditions.	 They	arrived
to	drive	 Herati	women	 indoors.	People	were	barred	from	 visiting	  the	shrines	of
Sufi	saints	of	which	 Herat	had	an	abundance.	The	Taliban	cancelled	out	years	of
effort	by	 the	Mujaheddin	commander	Ismael	Khan	 to	educate	the	population,	by
shutting	down	all	 girls‘	 schools.	Most	boys’	 schools	also	closed	as	their	teachers
were	 women.	  They	  segregated	the	  few	  functioning	   hospitals,	 shut	  down
bathhouses	and	banned	women	from	the	bazaar.	As	a	result	Herati	women	 were
the	first	 to	rebel	 against	Taliban	 excesses.	On	17	October	1996	more	 than	100
women	protested	outside	 the	office	 of	 the	 Governor	against	 the	closure	of	 the
city's	 bathhouses.	The	women	 were	 beaten	and	 then	 arrested	by	 the	 Taliban
religious	 police,	 who	 went	 from	  house	to	 house	 warning	 men	 to	 keep	 their
women	indoors.
       The	 international	media	and	the	UN	 largely	 chose	to	ignore	these	events	in
Herat,	but	 several	Western	 NGOs	realized	 the	 profound	 implications	 for	 their
future	activities.	 After	 a	long	 internal	 debate	and	fruitless	negotiations	 with	 the

148
Taliban	in	 Herat,	 UNICEF	 and	 Save	the	Children	 suspended	their	 educational
programmes	in	Herat	because	girls	were	excluded	 from	 them.12	The	suspension
of	these	aid	 programmes	 did	not	 deter	 the	Taliban,	 who	 quickly	  realized	that
other	UN	agencies	were	not	prepared	to	take	a	stand	against	them	on	the	gender
issue.	Moreover	they	 had	succeeded	in	dividing	 the	aid-giving	  community.	 UN
policy	was	in	 a	shambles	because	the	UN	agencies	had	failed	to	negotiate	from	a
common	platform.	As	 each	UN	agency	tried	to	cut	its	own	 deal	with	the	Taliban,
the	UN	 compromised	 its	principles,	 while	 Taliban	 restrictions	 on	 women	only
escalated.	‘The	 UN	 is	 on	 a	 slippery	 slope.	The	 UN	  thinks	 by	 making	 small
compromises	it	can	satisfy	 the	international	 community	 and	satisfy	the	Taliban.
In	fact	it	is	doing	 neither,’	the	head	of	a	European	NGO	told	me.13
       The	 world	only	 woke	up	to	the	Taliban's	 gender	policies	after	they	captured
Kabul	 in	 1996.	The	 UN	 could	 not	 avoid	 ignoring	 the	 issue	after	 the	massive
international	 media	  coverage	of	  the	 Taliban's	  hanging	 of	  former	  President
Najibullah	 and	the	treatment	 of	Kabul's	 women.	 Protest	statements	from	world
leaders	such	 as	UN	  Secretary	 General	 Boutros	 Boutros-Ghali,	  the	 heads	of
UNICEF,	  UNESCO,	 UNHCR	   and	 the	 European	 Commissioner	 for	  Human
Rights	met	 with	 no	 Taliban	 response.14Beauty,	hair	and	make-up	salons	were
shut	down	 in	 Kabul,	 as	were	women's	 bathhouses	–	the	only	 place	 where	hot
water	was	available.	Tailors	were	ordered	not	to	measure	women	for	clothes,	but
learned	to	 keep	 the	 measurements	of	 their	 regular	 customers	in	  their	 heads.
Fashion	magazines	were	destroyed.	‘Paint	your	nails,	take	a	snapshot	of	a	friend,
blow	a	flute,	 clap	to	a	beat,	invite	a	foreigner	 over	for	tea	and	you	have	broken	a
Taliban	edict,’	 wrote	an	American	reporter.15
       Until	  Kabul,	the	UN's	 disastrous	lack	of	a	policy	 had	been	ignored	but	then
it	 became	a	scandal	and	the	 UN	 came	in	 for	 scathing	 criticism	 from	 feminist
groups.	Finally	 the	UN	 agencies	were	forced	to	draw	 up	a	common	 position.	A
statement	spoke	of	‘maintaining	 and	promoting	the	inherent	equality	 and	dignity
of	all	 people’	and	‘not	 discriminating	 between	the	sexes,	races,	ethnic	groups	or
religions’.16	But	 the	same	UN	document	 also	stated	that	‘international	 agencies
hold	  local	  customs	 and	 cultures	  in	  high	  respect’.	  It	  was	  a	 classic	  UN
compromise,	which	gave	the	Taliban	 the	lever	to	continue	stalling,	 by	promising
to	allow	 female	education	after	 peace	came.	Nevertheless,	by	October	1996	the
UN	 was	 forced	 to	  suspend	eight	 income-generating	  projects	 for	 women	  in
Kabul,	because	women	were	no	longer	allowed	to	work	in	 them.
       During	 the	next	 18	months,	round	after	 round	of	fruitless	 negotiations	took

149
place	between	the	UN,	NGOs,	 Western	governments	and	the	Taliban,	 by	which
time	it	 became	clear	that	 a	hardline	 lobby	 of	Taliban	 ulema	 in	Kandahar	 were
determined	to	get	rid	 of	the	 UN	entirely.	 The	Taliban	 tightened	the	screws	ever
further.	 They	closed	 down	 home	schools	for	 girls	  which	 had	been	allowed	 to
continue	and	 then	prevented	women	 from	 attending	 general	hospitals.	In	 May
1997	 the	 religious	  police	 beat	 up	 five	  female	 staff	  of	 the	 US	  NGO	 Care
International	and	then	demanded	that	all	 aid	projects	receive	clearance	from	 not
just	 the	 relevant	 ministry,	  but	 also	 from	  the	 Ministeries	  of	 Interior,	  Public
Health,	Police	and	the	Department	of	 the	Promotion	of	 Virtue	 and	Prevention	of
Vice.	 This	 was	 followed	  by	 a	demand	 that	 all	 Muslim	  female	 humanitarian
workers	coming	 to	 Afghanistan	 be	accompanied	by	 a	male	relative.	 Finally	  in
July	1997	 the	Taliban	 insisted	that	 all	 35	UN	 and	NGO	 agencies	move	 out	of
their	offices	to	one	pre-selected	compound	at	the	destroyed	Polytechnic	building.
As	the	 European	Union	  suspended	furthur	 humanitarian	 aid,	 the	UN	  and	the
NGOs	left	Kabul.
       The	 plight	 of	Afghanistan's	 women	often	 hid	 the	fact	that	urban	 males	did
not	 fare	 much	 better	 under	the	 Taliban,	  especially	 non-Pashtuns.	All	  Kabul
males	were	given	just	 six	weeks	to	 grow	 a	full	 beard,	even	though	some	of	 the
ethnic	groups	such	as	the	Hazaras	have	very	limited	beard	growth.	 Beards	could
not	be	 trimmed	 shorter	 than	a	 man's	fist,	  leading	 to	jokes	 that	 Afghanistan's
biggest	import-export	 business	was	male	 facial	hair	 and	that	 men	did	 not	need
visas	to	 travel	 to	 Afghanistan,	 they	just	 needed	a	 beard.	The	 religious	 police
stood	at	 street	 corners	with	  scissors	cutting	  off	 long	  hair	 and	 often	 beating
culprits.	Men	 had	to	wear	 their	shalwars	or	 baggy	trousers	above	the	ankle	and
everyone	had	to	say	their	prayers	five	times	a	day.
       The	 Taliban	 also	 clamped	 down	 on	homosexuality.	  Kandahar's	Pashtuns
were	notorious	for	 their	 affairs	with	 young	 boys	and	the	rape	of	young	 boys	by
warlords	was	one	of	the	key	motives	for	 Mullah	 Omar	in	mobilizing	 the	Taliban.
But	homosexuality	 continued	and	the	punishments	were	 bizarre	if	 not	inhuman.
Two	 soldiers	caught	 indulging	 in	 homosexuality	 in	 Kabul	 in	 April	  1998	were
beaten	mercilessly	and	 then	tied	 up	and	driven	 around	 Kabul	 in	the	 back	of	 a
pick-up	with	 their	 faces	blackened	by	engine	oil.	 Men	accused	of	sodomy	faced
the	previously	 unheard	of	 ‘Islamic’	  punishment	 of	 having	a	 wall	 toppled	 over
them.
       In	 February	 1998	 three	men	sentenced	to	 death	for	 sodomy	 in	 Kandahar
were	taken	to	 the	base	of	a	 huge	mud	and	 brick	 wall,	 which	 was	then	toppled
over	them	by	a	tank.	They	remained	buried	under	the	rubble	for	 half	an	hour,	but

150
one	managed	to	survive.	 ‘His	 eminence	the	 Amirul	 Momineen	 [Mullah	  Omar]
attended	the	 function	  to	  give	 Sharia	 punishment	 to	  the	 three	 buggerers	in
Kandahar,’	wrote	 Anis,	the	Taliban	 newspaper.17	In	March	1998	two	 men	were
killed	 by	the	 same	method	in	 Kabul.	 ‘Our	 religious	 scholars	are	not	agreed	on
the	 right	 kind	  of	  punishment	 for	  homosexuality,’	  said	 Mullah	  Mohammed
Hassan,	epitomizing	 the	 kind	 of	  debates	the	Taliban	 were	 preoccupied	 with.
‘Some	say	we	 should	take	 these	sinners	to	a	 high	 roof	and	 throw	 them	down,
while	 others	say	we	should	 dig	a	 hole	beside	a	wall,	 bury	 them,	 then	push	the
wall	down	on	top	of	 them.’18
       The	 Taliban	also	banned	every	conceivable	form	of	 entertainment,	which	in
a	poor,	  deprived	 country	  such	 as	Afghanistan	  was	 always	 in	  short	 supply
anyway.	Afghans	 were	ardent	movie-goers	 but	 movies,	TV,	 videos,	 music	and
dancing	 were	  all	  banned.	 ‘Of	  course	  we	 realize	  that	  people	 need	 some
entertainment	but	 they	can	go	 to	 the	parks	and	 see	the	flowers,	 and	from	 this
they	will	 learn	 about	Islam,’	 Mullah	 Mohammed	 Hassan	told	me.	According	 to
Education	Minister	 Mullah	 Abdul	  Hanifi,	 the	Taliban	 ‘oppose	music	because	it
creates	a	strain	in	the	mind	and	hampers	study	of	 Islam’.19	Singing	and	dancing
were	banned	at	weddings	 which	 for	 centuries	had	been	major	 social	occasions
from	which	 hundreds	of	musicians	and	dancers	made	a	living.	Most	of	 them	fled
to	Pakistan.
       Nobody	  was	allowed	 to	 hang	paintings,	 portraits	 or	 photographs	in	 their
homes.	One	of	Afghanistan's	foremost	artists,	Mohammed	Mashal,	aged	82,	who
was	painting	 a	huge	mural	 showing	500	 years	of	 Herat's	history	 was	forced	 to
watch	 as	the	 Taliban	 whitewashed	 over	 it.	  Simply	 put,	 the	 Taliban	  did	 not
recognize	the	very	idea	of	 culture.	They	 banned	Nawroz,	the	traditional	 Afghan
New	 Year's	 celebrations	 as	anti-Islamic.	  An	 ancient	 spring	 festival,	  Nawroz
marks	the	first	 day	of	the	Persian	solar	calendar	when	people	visit	 the	graves	of
their	relatives.	People	were	forcibly	 stopped	from	doing	 so.	They	banned	Labour
Day	 on	1	 May	 for	  being	 a	communist	 holiday,	  for	 a	 time	 they	 also	banned
Ashura,	the	 Shia	Islamic	 month	 of	 mourning	 and	even	restricted	 any	 show	of
festivity	 at	Eid,	the	principle	Muslim	 clelebration	 of	the	year.
       Most	 Afghans	 felt	 demoralized	by	 the	fact	that	 the	Islamic	 world	 declined
to	take	 up	 the	 task	 of	 condemning	 the	 Taliban's	 extremism.	 Pakistan,	Saudi
Arabia	and	the	Arab	Gulf	 states	have	never	issued	a	single	statement	on	the	need
for	 women's	 education	 or	 human	 rights	  in	 Afghanistan.	  Nor	 did	  they	 ever
question	the	Taliban's	interpretation	of	Sharia.	Asian	Muslim	  countries	were	also
silent.	Surprisingly,	  Iran	 issued	the	 toughest	defence	of	 women's	 rights	 under

151
Islam.	‘Through	  their	 fossilized	 policies	 the	Taliban	 stop	 girls	 from	 attending
school,	stop	 women	 working	 out	 of	 their	 homes	 and	all	 that	 in	 the	 name	of
Islam.	What	 could	 be	worse	 than	committing	  violence,	narrow-mindedess	 and
limiting	 women's	rights	 and	defaming	Islam,’	 said	Ayatollah	  Ahmad	Jannati,	as
early	as	1996.20	Iranian	criticism	of	 Taliban	policies	 escalated	dramatically	after
the	deaths	of	their	diplomats	in	Mazar	in	1998.
       In	  Mazar	stands	the	 Tomb	 of	 Rabia	 Balkhi,	 a	 beautiful,	 tragic	 medieval
poetess.	She	was	the	first	woman	of	her	time	to	 write	love	 poetry	in	 Persian	and
died	tragically	  after	her	 brother	slashed	her	 wrists	 as	punishment	 for	 sleeping
with	a	 slave	lover.	She	wrote	 her	last	poem	 in	her	own	 blood	 as	she	lay	dying.
For	 centuries	 young	 Uzbek	 girls	  and	boys	  treated	her	 tomb	 with	  saint-like
devotion	and	would	pray	 there	for	success	in	their	love	affairs.	 After	 the	Taliban
captured	Mazar,	they	placed	her	tomb	out	 of	bounds.	Love,	 even	for	a	medieval
saint,	was	now	out	of	bounds.

Just	two	miles	from	 Kandahar's	city	centre	poppy	fields	stretch	as	far	as	the
horizon.	In	the	spring	of	1997,	farmers	were	carefully	tending	the	young,	green,
lettuce-like	leaves	of	the	plants	which	had	been	planted	a	few	weeks	earlier.
They	meticulously	 hoed	the	 soil	 to	 uproot	 weeds,	sprinkled	fertilizer	  and
repaired	irrigation	ditches	destroyed	by	the	Soviet	army	in	the	1980s	to	provide
water	to	the	fields.	In	a	few	weeks	the	leaves	would	sprout	a	bright	red	flower
which	would	bloom	until	its	petals	fell	away	to	reveal	a	hardened	capsule.
       Four	months	after	sowing	the	poppy	seeds,	the	capsules	would	be	ready	to
be	lanced	with	thin,	home-made	blades	for	their	liquid	gold.	The	farmer	would
squeeze	each	capsule	with	his	fingers	until	a	milky-white	gooey	substance	oozed
out.	By	the	next	day	the	opium	would	solidify	into	a	brown	gum	which	would	be
scraped	off	with	a	trowel.	This	operation	would	be	repeated	every	few	days	until
the	plant	stopped	yielding	any	gum.	The	raw	opium	would	be	collected,	slapped
together	in	a	cake	and	kept	wet	in	plastic	bags	until	the	dealers	arrived.	The	best
quality	opium,	generally	obtained	from	well-irrigated	land,	has	a	dark	 brown
colour	and	sticky	texture.	It	 is	 called	tor,	the	 substance	which	lubricates	the
finances	of	all	the	Afghan	warlords,	but	particularly	the	Taliban.1
       ‘We	 cannot	be	more	grateful	to	the	Taliban,’	said	Wali	 Jan,	a	toothless,
elderly	farmer	as	he	weeded	his	fields.	‘The	Taliban	have	brought	us	security	so
we	can	grow	our	poppy	in	peace.	I	need	the	poppy	crop	to	support	my	14	family
members,’	he	added.	The	Taliban	objective	of	reestablishing	peace	and	security
in	the	countryside	has	proved	to	be	an	immense	boon	to	opium	farming.	On	his
small	plot	of	land	Wali	Jan	produces	45	kilograms	of	raw	opium	every	year	and
earns	about	US$1,300	–	a	small	fortune	for	Afghan	farmers.	Wali	Jan	knows	that
refined	heroin	fetches	50	times	that	price	in	London	or	New	York,	but	he	is	more
than	happy	with	  what	 he	gets.	The	 results	of	  this	 cash	flow	 are	 evident
everywhere,	for	 there	is	 more	 reconstruction	going	 on	in	  villages	 around
Kandahar	than	anywhere	else	in	Afghanistan.

154
       The	 Taliban	have	provided	 an	Islamic	sanction	for	 farmers	like	 Wali	Jan	to
grow	even	more	opium,	even	though	the	Koran	 forbids	Muslims	 from	 producing
or	 imbibing	  intoxicants.	 Abdul	  Rashid,	 the	 head	of	  the	Taliban's	  anti-drugs
control	force	in	 Kandahar,	spelt	out	the	nature	of	his	unique	job.	He	is	authorised
to	impose	 a	strict	 ban	on	 the	growing	  of	hashish,	 ‘because	it	 is	consumed	by
Afghans	and	Muslims’.	  But,	Rashid	tells	 me	without	 a	hint	 of	sarcasm,	‘Opium
is	permissable	because	it	is	consumed	by	kafirs	[unbelievers]	in	the	West	and	not
by	Muslims	 or	Afghans.’	 There	 are	other	political	 imperatives	for	 letting	 poppy
farming	 flourish.	  ‘We	 let	 people	 cultivate	 poppies	 because	farmers	get	 good
prices.	We	cannot	push	the	people	to	grow	 wheat	as	there	would	 be	an	uprising
against	the	Taliban	 if	  we	forced	 them	 to	stop	 poppy	 cultivation.	 So	 we	grow
opium	and	get	our	wheat	from	Pakistan,’	he	said.2
       Governor	  Mohammed	 Hassan	 justifies	  this	 unique	 policy	  with	  another
twist.	‘Drugs	 are	evil	 and	we	would	 like	 to	substitute	poppies	with	 another	cash
crop,	but	it's	 not	possible	 at	the	moment,	 because	we	do	not	have	international
recognition.’	 Over	the	next	two	years,	Mullah	 Omar	was	to	periodically	 offer	 the
US	 and	 the	 UN	  an	  end	 to	 poppy	  cultivation,	  if	  the	  Taliban	 were	  given
international	recognition	 –	the	first	time	 a	movement	controlling	 90	per	cent	of	a
country	had	offered	the	international	community	 such	an	option.
       The	 Taliban	had	quickly	  realized	the	need	to	formalize	 the	drugs	economy
in	order	to	 raise	revenue.	When	they	 first	captured	 Kandahar	they	had	declared
they	would	 eliminate	 all	 drugs	and	 US	diplomats	 were	 encouraged	enough	by
the	announcement	to	make	immediate	contact	with	the	Taliban.	However,	 within
a	few	months	the	Taliban	realized	that	they	needed	the	income	from	poppies	and
would	anger	farmers	 by	banning	 it.	They	 began	to	collect	 an	Islamic	 tax	called
zakat	on	 all	 dealers	moving	 opium.	 According	  to	the	 Koran,	 Muslims	 should
give	2.5	per	cent	of	their	 disposable	income	as	zakat	to	the	poor,	but	the	Taliban
had	no	religious	 qualms	in	 collecting	 20	per	cent	of	 the	value	of	 a	truckload	 of
opium	as	zakat.	Alongside	this,	individual	 commanders	and	provincial	governors
imposed	their	own	taxes	to	keep	their	coffers	 full	 and	their	soldiers	fed.	Some	of
them	 became	substantial	 dealers	 in	 opium	 or	  used	their	  relatives	 to	 act	 as
middlemen.
       Meanwhile	 the	 Taliban	crackdown	 against	hashish,	a	staple	part	of	Afghan
truck-drivers	 diets	was	extremely	effective	 –	demonstrating	 that	any	crackdown
on	opium	could	 be	just	as	strictly	 implemented.	In	 two	warehouses	in	Kandahar
hundreds	of	sacks	of	 hashish	were	stored	after	 being	confiscated	from	 growers
and	dealers.	Ordinary	people	said	they	 were	too	scared	to	take	hashish	after	the

155
Taliban	had	 forbidden	 it.	 For	 those	who	 continued	to	 do	so	 clandestinely,	 the
Taliban	had	 devised	a	 novel	approach	 to	curing	 hashish	addiction.	  ‘When	 we
catch	hashish	smugglers	or	addicts	we	 interrogate	and	beat	them	mercilessly	 to
find	out	the	truth,’	 said	Abdul	 Rashid.	‘Then	we	put	them	in	 cold	water	for	many
hours,	two	 or	three	times	 a	day.	It's	 a	very	 good	cure,’	 he	added.3	Rashid	then
strode	into	the	jail	 and	pulled	out	several	terrified	 prisoner-addicts	 to	talk	to	 me.
They	 had	 no	  hesitation	 in	  agreeing	 that	 the	  Taliban's	 shock	  therapy	 was
effective.	‘When	 I	am	beaten	or	in	the	cold	water	I	 forget	all	 about	hashish,’	said
Bakht	 Mohammed,	 a	 shopkeeper	and	 hashish	dealer	 who	 was	 serving	 three
months	in	jail.
       Between	 1992	 and	1995	 Afghanistan	 had	 produced	 a	steady	2200–2400
metric	 tonnes	 of	 opium	  every	 year,	 rivalling	   Burma	 as	 the	 world's	  largest
producer	of	  raw	 opium.	 In	 1996	 Afghanistan	 produced	 2,250	 metric	 tonnes.
Officials	 of	the	United	 Nations	Drugs	Control	 Programme	(UNDCP)	 said	that	in
1996	Kandahar	province	 alone	produced	120	metric	 tonnes	of	 opium	harvested
from	 3,160	hectares	of	 poppy	 fields	 –	a	 staggering	increase	from	 1995,	 when
only	 79	 metric	 tonnes	was	 produced	from	  2,460	hectares.	Then,	 in	 1997,	 as
Taliban	 control	  extended	 to	 Kabul	  and	 furthur	  north,	  Afghanistan's	 opium
production	rose	by	 a	staggering	25	per	cent	to	 2,800	metric	 tonnes.	The	tens	of
thousands	of	Pashtun	refugees	arriving	in	Taliban-controlled	 areas	from	Pakistan
were	farming	their	lands	for	 the	easiest	and	most	lucrative	cash	crop	available.
       According	 to	 the	UNDCP,	 farmers	received	less	than	1	per	cent	of	the	total
profits	  generated	 by	 the	  opium	  trade,	 another	  2.5	 per	  cent	 remained	  in
Afghanistan	and	Pakistan	in	 the	hands	of	dealers,	while	 5	per	cent	was	spent	in
the	countries	through	 which	 the	heroin	 passed	while	en	route	to	 the	West.	 The
rest	of	the	 profits	 were	made	by	 the	dealers	and	distributors	 in	 Europe	and	the
US.	Even	with	  this	low	 rate	of	 return,	 it	 is	conservatively	 estimated	that	 some
one	million	 Afghan	 farmers	are	 making	over	 US$100	million	  dollars	a	year	 on
account	of	 growing	 poppies.	 The	Taliban	 were	 thus	raking	  in	at	 least	US$20
million	 in	taxes	and	even	more	on	the	side.
       Ever	 since	1980,	all	the	Mujaheddin	warlords	 had	used	drugs	money	to	help
fund	 their	 military	  campaigns	 and	line	  their	 own	 pockets.	 They	 had	 bought
houses	and	businesses	in	Peshawar,	new	jeeps	and	kept	bank	 accounts	abroad.
Publicly	they	 refused	to	admit	that	they	indulged	in	 drugs	trafficking,	 but	always
blamed	their	Mujaheddin	 rivals	 for	doing	 so.	But	none	had	ever	been	so	brazen,
or	honest,	in	declaring	their	 lack	of	 intention	to	 control	drugs	as	the	Taliban.	 By
1997,	UNDCP	 and	 the	US	 estimated	that	 96	per	 cent	of	 Afghan	 heroin	 came

156
from	areas	under	Taliban	control.
       The	 Taliban	 had	done	more	than	 just	expand	the	area	available	 for	 opium
production.	 Their	  conquests	 had	 also	 expanded	 trade	  and	 transport	 routes
significantly.	   Several	  times	  a	 month	  heavily	   armed	  convoys	  in	  Toyota
landcruisers	left	  Helmand	 province,	 where	 50	 per	 cent	 of	 Afghan	  opium	 is
grown,	 for	 a	 long,	 dusty	  journey.	 Some	 convoys	 travelled	 south	 across	the
deserts	of	  Baluchistan	 to	 ports	  on	 Pakistan's	 Makran	 coast,	 others	 entered
western	Iran,	skirted	 Tehran	and	travelled	 on	to	eastern	Turkey.	 Other	convoys
went	north-west	 to	Herat	 and	Turkmenistan.	 By	 1997	dealers	began	flying	  out
opium	on	cargo	 planes	from	Kandahar	and	Jalalabad	to	 Gulf	 ports	such	as	Abu
Dhabi	and	Sharjah.
       Central	 Asia	 was	the	 hardest	hit	 by	 the	explosion	 in	 Afghan	 heroin.	 The
Russian	mafia,	with	ties	to	Afghanistan	 established	during	the	Soviet	occupation,
used	their	networks	to	move	heroin	through	Central	Asia,	 Russia,	the	Baltics	and
into	Europe.	 Tajikistan	 and	Kyrgyzstan	 developed	important	 opium	 routes	and
became	significant	  opiate	producers	 themselves.	 Whereas	previously	  Afghan
opium	would	 be	refined	in	laboratories	in	 Pakistan,	a	crackdown	in	Pakistan	and
the	 new	 diversification	   in	  routes	 encouraged	 dealers	 to	 set	 up	  their	 own
laboratories	 inside	 Afghanistan.	  Acetic	  anhydride,	 a	  chemical	 necessary	 to
convert	opium	into	heroin	 was	smuggled	into	Afghanistan	via	Central	 Asia.
       The	 explosion	in	 heroin	production	 began	ironically	 not	in	Afghanistan	 but
in	 Pakistan.	Pakistan	 had	become	 a	major	 opium	  producer	during	  the	1980s
producing	around	800	metric	 tonnes	a	year	or	 70	per	cent	of	 the	world's	 supply
of	 heroin	 until	  1989.	 An	 immense	 narcotics	 trade	 had	developed	 under	 the
legitimizing	   umbrella	  of	  the	  CIA-ISI	   covert	  supply	  line	  to	  the	  Afghan
Mujaheddin.	 ‘During	   the	 1980s	 corruption,	  covert	 operations	 and	 narcotics
became	intertwined	in	 a	manner	which	 makes	it	 difficult	  to	 separate	Pakistan's
narcotics	traffic	 from	more	complex	 questions	of	regional	security	 and	insurgent
warfare,’	said	 a	landmark	1992	study	 on	the	failure	 of	US	 narcotics	policy.4	As
in	Vietnam	 where	the	CIA	 chose	to	ignore	the	trade	in	drugs	by	 anti-communist
guerrillas	 whom	 the	 CIA	 was	 financing,	  so	in	 Afghanistan	  the	US	 chose	 to
ignore	  the	  growing	   collusion	  between	  the	  Mujaheddin,	   Pakistani	  drugs
traffickers	and	elements	in	the	military.
       Instances	of	this	 collusion	that	 did	come	to	light	 in	the	1980s	were	only	 the
tip	of	 the	iceberg.	In	 1983	the	ISI	 Chief,	General	Akhtar	 Abdur	 Rehman	had	to
remove	the	entire	ISI	staff	in	Quetta,	because	of	their	involvement	 with	the	drugs
trade	and	sale	of	CIA	supplied	weapons	that	were	meant	for	the	Mujaheddin.5	In

157
1986,	Major	  Zahooruddin	  Afridi	  was	 caught	 while	 driving	  to	 Karachi	  from
Peshawar	 with	  220	  kilograms	  of	  high-grade	  heroin	  –	  the	  largest	 drugs
interception	 in	 Pakistan's	history.	 Two	 months	 later	 an	airforce	 officer	  Flight
Lieutenant	Khalilur	  Rehman	 was	caught	 on	 the	same	route	 with	 another	 220
kilograms	of	 heroin.	 He	calmly	 confessed	that	it	 was	his	fifth	 mission.	 The	US
street	value	of	 just	these	two	caches	was	US$600	 million	 dollars,	 equivalent	to
the	total	 amount	 of	 US	 aid	to	 Pakistan	 that	year.	 Both	 officers	 were	 held	 in
Karachi	 until	 they	 mysteriously	 escaped	from	 jail.	  ‘The	 Afridi-Rehman	  cases
pointed	to	a	heroin	syndicate	within	 the	army	and	the	ISI	linked	 to	Afghanistan,’
wrote	Lawrence	Lifschultz.6
       The	US	 Drugs	Enforcement	Administration	 (DEA)	 had	17	full-time	 officers
in	 Pakistan	 during	  the	 1980s,	 who	  identified	  40	  major	 heroin	  syndicates,
including	 some	headed	by	top	government	officials.	  Not	a	single	 syndicate	was
broken	up	during	 that	 decade.	There	was	clearly	 a	conflict	  of	interest	 between
the	CIA	which	 wanted	no	embarrassing	disclosures	about	drug	links	between	the
‘heroic’	 Mujaheddin	and	Pakistani	officials	 and	traffickers	 and	the	DEA.	Several
DEA	 officials	 asked	to	be	relocated	and	 at	least	one	resigned,	because	the	CIA
refused	to	allow	them	to	carry	out	their	 duties.
       During	 the	 jihad	both	 the	Mujaheddin	 and	officers	 in	the	 communist	army
in	  Kabul	  seized	 the	  opportunity.	  The	  logistics	   of	  their	  operations	 were
remarkably	 simple.	  The	  donkey,	  camel	 and	 truck	  convoys	  which	  carried
weapons	into	Afghanistan	 were	coming	 back	empty.	 Now	 they	carried	 out	raw
opium.	 The	CIA–ISI	  bribes	 that	were	 paid	 off	 to	 the	Pashtun	chiefs	 to	 allow
weapons	convoys	through	their	tribal	 areas,	soon	involved	the	same	tribal	chiefs
allowing	 heroin	  runs	along	 the	 same	 routes	back	 to	 Pakistan.	 The	 National
Logistics	Cell,	 an	army-run	 trucking	 company	 which	 transported	CIA	 weapons
from	 Karachi	  port	 to	  Peshawar	and	 Quetta,	  was	 frequently	 used	 by	  well-
connected	dealers	to	 transport	 heroin	 back	to	 Karachi	 for	 export.	 The	 heroin
pipeline	 in	 the	1980s	 could	 not	 have	operated	without	  the	 knowledge,	 if	 not
connivance,	of	officials	 at	the	highest	level	 of	the	army,	 the	government	and	the
CIA.	 Everyone	 chose	to	ignore	 it	 for	 the	 larger	task	 was	to	 defeat	the	 Soviet
Union.	Drugs	control	 was	on	nobody's	agenda.
       It	 was	 not	until	 1992,	 when	General	 Asif	 Nawaz	 became	Pakistan's	army
chief,	that	 the	military	  began	a	concerted	effort	 to	root	 out	 the	narcotics	mafia
that	had	developed	 in	 the	Pakistani	 armed	forces.	Nevertheless,	heroin	 money
had	now	  penetrated	Pakistan's	 economy,	 politics	  and	society.	 Western	 anti-
narcotics	agencies	in	Islamabad	kept	track	of	drugs	lords,	who	 became	Members

158
of	 the	 National	  Assembly	  during	 the	  first	  governments	 of	 Prime	  Minister
Benazir	 Bhutto	 (1988–90)	 and	 Nawaz	Sharif	  (1990–93).	 Drugs	 lords	 funded
candidates	to	high	 office	 in	 both	 Bhutto's	 Pakistan	People's	Party	and	 Sharif's
Pakistan	Muslim	 League.	 Industry	 and	trade	 became	increasingly	 financed	by
laundered	drugs	money	and	the	black	economy,	which	accounted	for	between	30
and	50	per	cent	of	 the	total	Pakistan	economy,	was	heavily	 subsidised	by	 drugs
money.
       It	  was	 only	 after	 the	 Soviet	 withdrawal	  from	 Afghanistan	  that	 US	 and
Western	pressure	began	 to	 mount	 on	 Islamabad	 to	 curtail	 the	 production	 of
opium	in	 Pakistan.	Over	the	 following	 decade	(1989-99)	 some	US$100	million
dollars	 of	 Western	 aid	 to	 combat	 narcotics	 was	made	 available	 to	 Pakistan.
Poppy	cultivation	 was	drastically	 reduced	from	 a	high	of	 800	tons	to	24	 tons	in
1997	and	two	tons	by	1999.	Crop	substitution	projects	in	 the	NWFP	proved	to	be
extremely	 successful.	Nevertheless	 the	dealers	 and	the	 transport	 mafia	 never
went	away	and	 they	received	a	major	 boost	with	 the	arrival	 of	 the	Taliban	 and
the	subsequent	increase	in	Afghan	heroin	 production.	 Pakistan	was	no	longer	 a
heroin	 producer,	 but	 it	  became	 a	 major	 transport	 route	 for	  Taliban	  heroin
exports.	The	same	dealers,	truck	drivers,	madrassa	and	government	contacts	and
the	arms,	fuel	and	food	 supply	chain	 that	provided	the	 Taliban	with	 its	 supplies
also	funnelled	drugs	–	 just	as	the	arms	pipeline	for	 the	Mujaheddin	 had	done	in
the	1980s.
       Pakistan	 was	slipping	 back	 into	bad	 habits.	In	 February	1998	 the	Clinton
administration	accused	Islamabad	of	 doing	little	 to	 curb	production	 and	exports
of	 heroin.	  The	 US	  refused	 to	 certify	  that	  Pakistan	 was	 curbing	  narcotics
production,	but	 gave	a	waiver	on	the	grounds	of	 US	national	 security	interests.7
But	the	drugs	problem	was	now	no	longer	 confined	to	Pakistan	and	Afghanistan.
As	export	 routes	multiplied	  in	 all	 directions,	 there	was	 a	dramatic	 increase	in
drug	 consumption	 across	 the	 region.	 By	 1998,	 58	  per	 cent	 of	 opiates	 was
consumed	within	  the	 region	 itself	  and	only	  42	 per	 cent	 was	actually	  being
exported.8	Pakistan,	which	had	no	heroin	addicts	in	1979,	had	650,000	addicts	in
1986,	three	 million	  by	 1992	 and	 an	estimated	 five	 million	   by	 1999.	 Heroin
addiction	and	drugs	money	 fuelled	law	 and	order	problems,	 unemployment	and
allowed	ethnic	and	sectarian	extremist	groups	to	arm	themselves.
       In	 Iran,	the	government	 admitted	to	having	 1.2	million	 addicts	in	 1998,	but
senior	officials	  in	 Tehran	 told	 me	 the	 figure	 was	 nearer	three	 million	  -even
though	Iran	 had	one	of	 the	toughest	anti-narcotics	 policies	in	 the	world,	 where
anyone	 caught	  with	   a	  few	  ounces	  of	  heroin	   faced	  the	  death	 penalty

159
automatically.9	And	 Iran	had	tried	 much	harder	than	Pakistan	to	 keep	the	drugs
menace	away.	Since	the	1980s	Iran	had	lost	2,500	men	from	its	security	forces	in
military	 operations	to	stop	convoys	 carrying	drugs	from	 Afghanistan.	 After	 Iran
closed	its	 borders	 with	  Afghanistan	 during	 the	 tensions	 with	  the	Taliban	  in
September	1998,	Iranian	security	forces	caught	five	 tons	of	heroin	on	 the	border
in	a	few	 weeks.	The	Taliban	 faced	a	major	 financial	 crisis	as	the	 closed	border
led	to	a	drop	in	heroin	exports	and	tax	revenue.
       Heroin	    addiction	   was	   also	   increasing	   in	   Uzbekistan,	   Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan	and	Kyrgyzstan	as	they	became	part	of	the	heroin	export	 chain.	In
1998	guards	on	the	Tajikistan–Afghanistan	 border	confiscated	one	ton	 of	opium
and	200	kilograms	  of	 heroin.	In	 January	1999,	 Tajikistan's	 President	Imomali
Rakhmanov	told	 an	 international	 conference	 that	drugs	 were	 being	 smuggled
into	his	country	 from	Afghanistan	 at	the	rate	of	one	ton	 a	day	and	addiction	was
increasing.	Uzbekistan	 said	 there	was	 an	11	 per	 cent	increase	 of	 drugs	from
Afghanistan	during	1998.
       I	 saw	 heroin	being	 openly	sold	 outside	five-star	 hotels	 in	 Ashkhabad,	the
capital	 of	 Turkmenistan,	 and	 inside	 the	 hotels	 flashy	 Turkmen	  and	 Russian
mafioso	with	 their	 even	 flashier	girlfriends,	  spoke	of	 their	 trips	 to	the	 Afghan
border	‘to	 do	business’.	In	1997	two	 tons	of	 heroin	and	38	tons	of	 hashish	were
seized	by	 the	authorities.	 By	 1999,	 Turkmenistan,	 with	 its	 conciliatory	 policy
with	 the	Taliban	 had	 become	the	 principle	 route	 of	 export	for	 Afghan	  heroin
with	 corrupt	  Turkmen	 officials	  benefiting	  from	 the	 trade.10	President	 Askar
Akayev	 of	 Kyrgyzstan	 told	 me	in	 January	1999,	 that	 his	country	 was	 now	 ‘a
major	route	for	 drugs	trafficking	  and	it	 is	responsible	 for	the	 growth	of	 crime’.
Akayev	 said	the	war	 against	drugs	 could	 not	be	won	 until	 there	 was	peace	in
Afghanistan	and	 the	civil	  war	had	 become	the	most	 destabilizing	 factor	in	 the
region.11
       The	 heroin	 explosion	  emanating	from	  Afghanistan	 is	 now	 affecting	  the
politics	and	economics	of	the	entire	region.	It	 is	crippling	 societies,	distorting	the
economies	of	 already	fragile	 states	and	creating	 a	new	 narco-elite	 which	 is	 at
odds	with	 the	ever	increasing	 poverty	of	 the	population.	 ‘Drugs	 is	 determining
the	 politics	 of	  this	 region	 as	 never	 before,’	  said	 a	 Western	 ambassador	in
Islamabad.	 ‘We	  equate	it	  now	  with	  other	 serious	 threats	  such	 as	 Islamic
fundamentalism,	 terrorism	 and	 potential	 economic	 collapse	 in	 some	of	 these
countries,’	he	added.12
       This	 worsening	situation	prompted	attempts	by	the	international	 community
to	talk	to	the	Taliban.	 After	six	 months	of	secret	negotiations	UNDCP	concluded

160
an	agreement	with	the	Taliban	in	 October	1997.	The	Taliban	 agreed	to	eradicate
poppy	growing	 if	  the	international	 community	 provided	 funds	 to	 help	farmers
with	 substitute	 crops.	 Pino	 Arlacchi,	  the	 head	of	 UNDCP	  asked	for	  US$25
million	 from	  donors	for	 a	 ten-year	programme	 to	eliminate	 poppy	 farming	  in
areas	controlled	by	the	Taliban.	‘Afghan	  heroin	supplies	80	per	cent	of	 Europe's
supply	of	heroin	 and	50	per	cent	of	the	world's	 supply	of	 heroin.	We	 are	talking
about	eliminating	 half	the	 heroin	of	 the	world,’	 Arlacchi	 said	enthusiastically.13
UNDCP	 said	it	 would	introduce	 new	 cash	crops,	improve	irrigation,	  build	 new
factories	and	pay	for	law	enforcement.
       But	 the	agreement	was	never	implemented	by	the	Taliban	and	after	the	pull-
out	of	 UN	 agencies	from	Afghanistan	 in	 1998,	it	 simply	 fell	 apart.	Six	 months
later	Arlacchi	 was	 less	optimistic	 when	 he	told	 me,	‘Afghanistan	 is	 one	of	 the
most	difficult	  and	crucial	 parts	of	 the	 world	 but	a	wider	 political	  settlement	is
needed	before	drugs	production	 can	be	be	controlled.’14	The	 record	of	 wealthy
countries	 supporting	 UNDCP	  initiatives	  was	 not	 particularly	  hopeful	 either.
Between	 1993	  and	 1997	  UNDCP	   had	 asked	 for	   US$16.4	 million	   from
international	 donors	for	 anti-narcotics	 work	  in	 Afghanistan	 and	received	 only
half	that	amount.
       The	 taxes	on	 opium	 exports	became	the	mainstay	 of	 Taliban	 income	and
their	war	 economy.	In	1995	 UNDCP	 estimated	that	Pakistan-Afghanistan	drugs
exports	were	earning	some	50	billion	  rupees	(US$1.35	billion)	  a	year.	By	 1998
heroin	exports	had	 doubled	in	 value	to	 US$3	billion.	  Drugs	 money	funded	 the
weapons,	ammunition	and	fuel	 for	 the	war.	It	 provided	 food	and	clothes	for	 the
soldiers	and	 paid	the	 salaries,	transport	 and	perks	 that	 the	Taliban	 leadership
allowed	its	 fighters.	The	 only	thing	 that	can	be	said	in	 the	Taliban's	favour	 was
that	unlike	 in	 the	past,	 this	income	 did	 not	appear	to	 line	 the	pockets	 of	 their
leaders,	as	they	continued	to	live	extremely	 frugal	lives.	 But	it	 made	the	Afghan
and	Pakistani	traffickers	extremely	rich.
       Alongside	  the	 drugs	trade,	 the	 traditional	 Afghan	  smuggling	 trade	 from
Pakistan	and	 now	 the	 Gulf	  states,	expanded	 under	 the	 Taliban	 and	 created
economic	 havoc	 for	 neighbouring	  states.	The	 Afghan	  Transit	 Trade	 (ATT),
described	in	detail	in	 Chapter	15,	is	the	largest	source	of	official	  revenue	for	the
Taliban	 and	 generates	 an	 estimated	 US$3	 billion	  annually	  for	  the	 Afghan
economy.	Customs	 officials	  in	 Kandahar,	Kabul	 and	 Herat	 refuse	to	 disclose
their	daily	earnings	but	with	 some	300	trucks	a	day	passing	through	Kandahar	on
their	 way	to	 Iran	 and	 Central	Asia	 via	 Herat	 and	 another	200	 trucks	 passing
through	Jalalabad	and	Kabul	 to	 the	north,	 daily	 earnings	are	considerable.	The

161
illegal	 trade	in	consumer	goods,	food	 and	fuel	 through	Afghanistan	 is	crippling
industries,	reducing	 state	revenues	and	 creating	periodic	 food	 shortages	in	 all
neigbouring	states	–	affecting	 their	economies	in	 a	way	 that	was	never	the	case
during	the	jihad.
       Taliban	 customs	revenues	from	the	smuggling	 trade	are	channelled	through
the	State	Bank	of	Afghanistan	which	 is	trying	 to	set	up	branches	in	all	provincial
capitals.	But	there	is	no	book-keeping	 to	show	what	 money	comes	in	and	where
it	 goes.	These	‘official’	   revenues	do	not	 account	for	 the	 war	 budget	which	 is
accumulated	and	 spent	directly	 by	 Mullah	  Omar	 in	 Kandahar	 and	is	 derived
from	 drugs	income,	 aid	 from	 Pakistan	and	 Saudi	Arabia	 and	 other	donations.
'We	have	 revenues	from	 customs,	mining	 and	zakat,	 but	there	 are	some	other
sources	of	income	for	the	war	 effort	 that	do	not	come	through	 the	State	Bank	of
Afghanistan,’	admitted	 Maulvi	 Arifullah	 Arif,	  the	Deputy	Minister	 of	Finance.15
       With	 the	war	 being	run	directly	 by	Mullah	 Omar	from	 his	tin	 trunks	stuffed
full	of	 money,	which	 he	keeps	under	his	bed,	making	a	national	budget	is	next	to
impossible	–	 even	if	 the	 expertise	was	available,	 which	 it	 is	 not.	The	 Finance
Ministry	 has	no	qualified	economist	or	banker.	The	Minister	 and	his	deputies	are
mullahs	with	a	madrassa	education	and	knowledgeable	bureaucrats	were	purged.
The	paucity	of	 official	 funds	 can	be	judged	by	the	fact	 that	in	 1997	the	Finance
Ministry	  had	 set	 a	 budget	 of	 the	 equivalent	  of	 US$100,000	 for	  the	 entire
country's	administration	 and	development	programmes	for	 the	Afghan	 financial
year	–	February	1997–January	1998.	In	fact	this	amount	just	covered	salaries	for
officials.
       Some	 of	 the	 mullah	  traders	within	  the	 Taliban	 are	 trying	 to	 encourage
industry	and	foreign	 investment,	but	there	appears	to	be	no	serious	support	from
the	Taliban	 leadership	for	 these	efforts.	‘We	 want	 to	develop	 Afghanistan	 as	a
modern	state	and	we	have	enormous	mineral,	oil	and	gas	resources	which	should
interest	foreign	 investors,’	 said	Maulvi	  Ahmed	 Jan,	the	Minister	 of	 Mines	 and
Industries,	who	 left	his	 carpet	business	in	Saudi	 Arabia	to	 join	 the	Taliban	 and
run	Afghanistan's	 industries.	‘Before	 we	took	 control	 of	the	 south	there	was	no
factory	 working	  in	  the	 country.	 Now	  we	 have	 reopened	 mines	 and	 carpet
factories	with	 the	 help	of	 Pakistani	 and	Afghan	 traders,’	 he	added.	He	 agreed
that	few	members	of	 the	powerful	 Kandahar	Shura	were	interested	in	 economic
issues	as	they	were	too	involved	with	the	war.16
       As	  an	 investment	 incentive	 to	 foreigners,	 particularly	  Pakistani	 traders,
Ahmed	Jan	was	offering	free	land	to	anyone	who	would	 build	 a	new	factory.	But
with	the	collapse	of	the	country's	infrastructure,	 any	investor	would	 have	to	build

162
his	own	 roads	and	 provide	 electricity	  and	housing.	 Only	 a	few	 Pakistani	 and
Afghan	  transport-traders	 based	 in	  Peshawar	and	  Quetta,	 who	  are	 already
involved	  in	  either	  smuggling	  or	  the	  lucrative	  illegal	   timber	  trade	  from
Afghanistan,	appear	to	be	taking	an	interest	in	projects	such	as	mining.
       There	 is	no	educated	or	professional	class	left	in	 the	country.	In	 the	several
waves	of	refugees	that	 have	left	 the	cities	 since	1992,	all	 the	educated,	trained
professionals,	even	telephone	operators,	electricians	and	mechanics,	have	gone.
Most	of	the	 Taliban	running	 the	departments	of	finance,	economy	and	the	social
sector	are	mullah	 traders	–	 businessmen,	truck	 transporters	and	smugglers	 for
whom	 the	  rationale	 of	  nation-building	  is	  seen	 only	  in	 the	  perspective	 of
expanding	the	market	for	smuggling	and	the	trucking	 business	across	the	region.
       One	  such	 is	  Mullah	  Abdul	  Rashid,	 a	  fierce-looking	  Taliban	  military
commander	 from	  Helmand,	 who	  gained	 notoriety	  in	  April	  1997	 when	  he
captured	a	 Pakistani	 military	   patrol	 that	 had	 entered	 Afghan	 territory	  from
Baluchistan	province	 to	 chase	a	 gang	of	 drug	 smugglers.	Rashid	 arrested	the
soldiers	and	sent	them	 to	Kandahar,	sparking	 off	 a	row	 with	 Pakistan.	He	 also
runs	the	Taliban-owned	marble	mines	in	Helmand.	The	mine	which	 employs	500
men	with	 picks,	 has	no	mining	 engineers,	no	 equipment,	no	 electricity	 and	no
expertise.	Rashid's	mining	  techniques	are	limited	  to	 using	 explosives	to	 blast
(and	scar)	the	marble.
       The	 Taliban's	appetite	 for	 foreign	investment	 had	been	first	 wetted	by	 the
competition	 between	  two	 oil	  companies,	 Bridas	  of	 Argentina	  and	  the	 US
company	Unocal,	who	were	competing	 for	influence	 with	the	Taliban	 in	order	to
build	a	gas	pipeline	 from	Turkmenistan	 to	Pakistan	across	southern	Afghanistan
(see	Chapters	12	 and	 13).	 The	pipeline	  attracted	a	 few	 swashbuckling,	 risk-
taking	 businessmen.	These	included	  Afghan	 and	 Pakistani	 traders	who	  built
regular	 petrol	 pumps	 in	 Kandahar	 and	 along	 the	 route	 to	 Herat.	 They	 also
promised	to	build	roads.	A	USA-based	group	provided	 the	Taliban	with	 a	mobile
telephone	network	 between	Kabul	  and	Kandahar	 in	 1999.	 Such	activities	 did
little	  for	  re-establishing	  a	  regular	 economy.	  They	  were	  solely	  aimed	  at
improving	 the	Taliban's	 smuggling	 business	and	making	 life	 easier	 for	 traders
and	transporters.
       Serious	foreign	 investment	and	even	aid	to	begin	reconstruction	 is	certainly
not	going	to	happen	until	 there	is	an	end	to	the	war	and	a	government	which	can
ensure	minimum	stability	 and	public	loyalty.	 In	the	meantime	Afghanistan	is	like
an	economic	black	 hole	that	 is	sending	out	 waves	of	 insecurity	 and	chaos	to	a
region	  that	   is	  already	   facing	   multiple	   economic	   crises.	  Afghanistan's

163
infrastructure	   lies	   in	   ruins.	   Basic	   civic	    amenities	   available	   in	   any
underdeveloped	country	  are	 non-existent.	  There	 is	 no	 running	  water,	  little
electricity,	 telephones,	motorable	 roads	 or	 regular	 energy	supplies.	 There	 are
severe	shortages	of	water,	food	and	housing	and	other	basic	necessities.	What	is
available	is	too	expensive	for	most	people	to	afford.
       The	  laying	  of	  millions	   of	 mines	  during	  the	 war	  has	 created	 severe
resettlement	problems	in	 the	 cities	 and	the	countryside,	 where	 agriculture	 and
irrigation	 in	 the	most	 fertile	 areas	is	hampered	by	 mines.	Since	1979,	 400,000
Afghans	have	 been	killed	 and	 another	400,000	 injured	 in	 mine	 explosions.	A
staggering	13	per	cent	of	all	Afghan	 families	has	had	a	relative	killed	 or	crippled
in	 mine	 accidents	 and	over	 300	 people	 are	 killed	  or	 maimed	 every	 month.
Although	 some	4,000	deminers	working	 for	 the	UN	 and	other	NGOs	 are	trying
to	demine	 the	country	 as	fast	 as	possible,	it	 could	 take	another	 decade	before
even	the	major	 cities	 are	demined.	In	 1998,	 after	six	 years	of	 extensive	work,
Kabul	still	 had	some	200	 square	miles	out	of	 a	total	 of	500	square	miles	 of	the
city	which	 had	not	been	demined.17
       Apart	 from	 mines,	the	daily	battle	 for	most	Kabulis	 is	to	find	 enough	of	the
grubby	Afghani	 notes	to	pay	for	 daily	 foodstuffs.	Although	 the	shops	are	full	 of
smuggled	foodstuffs	 from	 Iran	 and	Pakistan,	people	do	 not	have	the	 money	to
buy	them.	 Salaries	for	 those	Afghan	 surgeons	who	 have	not	 fled	 Kabul	 is	the
equivalent	 of	 US$5	  a	 month.	 They	 only	  survive	 because	 their	 salaries	 are
subsidized	by	 the	ICRC.	  Average	salaries	 are	around	US$1–3	 a	 month.	As	 a
result	of	grinding	 poverty	and	no	jobs,	a	large	percentage	of	the	urban	population
is	totally	  dependent	 on	UN	  agencies	for	  basic	survival	  and	 subsidized	food
supplies.	Fifty	 per	cent	of	Kabul's	 1.2	million	  people	receive	some	kind	of	 food
aid	from	Western	humanitarian	agencies.
       This	 poses	a	continuing	dilemma	for	 the	UN	 as	to	whether	its	humanitarian
aid	 is	 only	 sustaining	 the	 war,	 because	it	  gives	 the	warlords	  the	 excuse	to
absolve	themselves	 of	 taking	  responsibility	  for	 the	 civilian	   population.	 The
Taliban	continuously	 insisted	 that	they	 were	not	responsible	 for	the	 population
and	that	 Allah	  would	  provide.	 However,	  the	 suffering	 of	  ordinary	 Afghans
would	only	 increase	if	 the	 UN	 and	NGOs	were	 to	cease	their	 relief	 operations
altogether	and	in	particular	 stop	feeding	 vulnerable	groups	such	 as	widows	and
orphans.
       In	 1998	the	economic	situation	visibly	 worsened.	Northern	Afghanistan	 was
hit	by	 three	devastating	 earthquakes,	the	Taliban	 siege	of	 the	Hazarajat	 led	to
widespread	starvation	 in	 central	 Afghanistan,	  floods	 in	 Kandahar	 submerged

164
villages	and	crops	and	the	 urban	population	 was	blighted	by	 the	pull-out	 of	 aid
agencies	after	  the	 US	  missile	  strikes	 in	  August	  1998.	 There	 was	  visible
malnutrition	 on	the	streets	of	Kabul	during	the	freezing	winter	 of	1998–99,	when
few	could	afford	 to	eat	even	one	meal	a	day	or	heat	their	homes.	However,	there
were	signs	of	 hope,	if	 only	 peace	would	come.	 The	WFP	 estimated	that	cereal
production	for	 1998	 would	 be	3.85	million	  tons,	five	 per	 cent	more	 than	1997
and	the	best	year	of	production	since	1978.
       This	  reflected	 the	improved	  law	 and	order	 in	  rural	 areas	under	Taliban
control,	 the	 lack	 of	 fighting	  and	 the	 return	 of	 refugees	 to	 farm	 their	 lands.
Although	 there	are	still	 1.2	million	 Afghan	 refugees	in	Pakistan	and	1.4	 million
in	Iran,	more	than	4	million	 refugees	had	returned	home	between	1992	and	1999.
However,	the	 Taliban	and	 the	UN	 agencies	still	 had	to	import	 750,000	 tons	of
wheat	in	1998	for	the	cities	to	make	up	the	food	shortfall.	 Clearly	 the	Taliban	did
not	create	the	economic	devastation	in	Afghanistan.	Rather	they	inherited	it	from
the	civil	 war	 which	all	 the	factions	 waged	after	1992.	 But	none	of	 the	factions,
including	  the	 Taliban	 have	 paid	 any	 attention	  to	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 civilian
population.
       Thus	 it	 is	not	 surprising	 that	Western	 countries	are	suffering	 from	 ‘donor
fatigue’	 –	 the	reluctance	 to	 come	up	 with	 more	 money	 for	 humanitarian	 aid,
when	the	 civil	  war	continues	 unabated	and	 the	warlords	 are	 so	irresponsible.
‘The	  level	   of	  suffering	   experienced	 by	   the	  Afghan	  people	  is	  literally
horrendous,’	said	Alfredo	 Witschi-Cestari,	 the	UN	 Co-ordinator	for	 Afghanistan
until	1998.	‘As	 the	years	go	by,	funds	trickle	 in	slower	 and	slower.	We	raise	less
than	 half	  the	 money	 we	  ask	 for.’18	 The	  warlords	  are	 not	 even	 remotely
concerned	with	 planning	  for	 the	 reconstruction	 of	 the	 country.	 Afghanistan's
economic	black	 hole	is	 getting	larger	 and	wider,	 sucking	more	 and	more	of	 its
own	population	and	the	people	of	the	region	into	it.

At	  Torkham	 –	 the	border	 post	at	 the	 head	of	 the	 Khyber	 Pass	between
Afghanistan	and	Pakistan,	a	single	chain	barrier	seperates	the	two	countries.	On
the	Pakistani	side	stand	the	smartly	turned	out	Frontier	Scouts	–	paramilitaries	in
their	grey	shalwar	kameezes	and	turbans.	It	was	April	 1989,	and	the	Soviet
withdrawal	from	 Afghanistan	had	 just	 been	completed.	I	 was	returning	 to
Pakistan	by	road	from	Kabul,	but	the	barrier	was	closed.	Exhausted	from	my
journey	I	lay	down	on	a	grass	verge	on	the	Afghan	side	of	the	border	and	waited.
       Suddenly,	along	the	road	behind	me,	a	truck	full	of	Mujaheddin	roared	up
and	stopped.	But	those	on	board	were	not	Afghans.	Light-coloured	Arabs,	blue-
eyed	Central	Asians	and	swarthy	Chinese-looking	faces	peered	out	from	roughly
wound	 turbans	and	 ill-fitting	   shalwar	 kameezes.	They	 were	 swathed	in
ammunition	belts	and	carried	kalashnikovs.	Except	for	one	Afghan,	who	was
acting	as	interpreter	and	guide,	not	a	 single	one	of	 the	30	foreigners	spoke
Pushto,	Dari	or	even	Urdu.	As	we	waited	for	the	border	to	open	we	got	talking.
       The	group	was	made	up	of	Filipino	 Moros,	Uzbeks	from	 Soviet	Central
Asia,	Arabs	from	Algeria,	Egypt,	Saudi	Arabia	and	Kuwait	and	Uighurs	from
Xinjiang	in	China.	Their	escort	was	a	member	of	Gulbuddin	Hikmetyar's	Hizb-e-
Islami.	Under	training	at	a	camp	near	the	border	they	were	going	on	weekend
leave	to	 Peshawar	and	were	looking	 forward	 to	 getting	 mail	 from	 home,
changing	their	clothes	and	having	a	good	meal.	They	had	come	to	fight	the	jihad
with	the	Mujaheddin	and	to	train	in	weapons,	bomb-making	and	military	tactics
so	they	could	take	the	jihad	back	home.
       That	evening,	 Prime	Minister	 Benazir	Bhutto	 had	hosted	a	 dinner	for
journalists	in	Islamabad.	Among	the	guests	was	Lieutenant	General	Hameed
Gul,	the	head	of	the	ISI	and	the	most	fervent	Islamic	ideologue	in	the	army	after
Zia's	death.	General	Gul	was	triumphant	about	the	Soviet	withdrawal.	I	asked
him	if	 he	was	not	playing	with	 fire	by	 inviting	Muslim	 radicals	from	Islamic
countries,	who	were	ostensibly	allies	 of	 Pakistan.	Would	these	radicals	not

167
create	dissension	in	their	own	 countries,	endangering	Pakistan's	foreign	 policy?
‘We	are	fighting	  a	jihad	and	 this	is	the	 first	Islamic	 international	 brigade	in	 the
modern	era.	 The	 communists	have	 their	 international	  brigades,	the	 West	 has
NATO,	 why	 can't	 the	Muslims	 unite	 and	form	  a	common	 front?’	 the	 General
replied.	It	 was	 the	first	 and	 only	 justification	  I	 was	ever	given	 for	 what	 were
already	called	 the	 Arab-Afghans,	 even	 though	none	 were	 Afghans	 and	many
were	not	Arabs.
       Three	 years	earlier	in	 1986,	 CIA	 chief	 William	  Casey	had	stepped	up	the
war	against	the	Soviet	Union	 by	 taking	three	significant,	 but	 at	that	time	 highly
secret,	measures.	He	had	persuaded	the	US	Congress	to	provide	the	Mujaheddin
with	 American-made	Stinger	 anti-aircraft	 missiles	to	 shoot	down	 Soviet	planes
and	provide	US	advisers	to	train	 the	guerrillas.	 Until	 then	no	US-made	weapons
or	personnel	had	been	used	directly	in	the	war	effort.	The	CIA,	 Britain's	 MI6	and
the	ISI	 also	 agreed	on	 a	provocative	 plan	 to	 launch	guerrilla	  attacks	into	 the
Soviet	 Socialist	  Republics	  of	 Tajikistan	   and	 Uzbekistan,	  the	 soft	  Muslim
underbelly	of	 the	Soviet	state	from	 where	Soviet	troops	in	 Afghanistan	received
their	 supplies.	 The	 task	was	 given	  to	 the	 ISI's	 favourite	 Mujaheddin	  leader
Gulbuddin	Hikmetyar.	 In	 March	 1987,	small	units	 crossed	the	Amu	Darya	river
from	 bases	 in	 northern	 Afghanistan	  and	 launched	 their	  first	 rocket	  attacks
against	villages	in	Tajikistan.	 Casey	was	delighted	with	the	news	and	on	his	next
secret	trip	to	Pakistan	he	crossed	the	border	into	Afghanistan	 with	 President	Zia
to	review	the	Mujaheddin	 groups.1
       Thirdly,	  Casey	committed	 CIA	 support	to	 a	long-standing	 ISI	 initiative	 to
recruit	 radical	Muslims	  from	 around	 the	world	 to	 come	 to	Pakistan	 and	fight
with	 the	Afghan	 Mujaheddin.	 The	 ISI	 had	encouraged	this	 since	1982	 and	by
now	all	the	other	 players	had	their	reasons	for	supporting	the	idea.	President	Zia
aimed	to	cement	Islamic	unity,	 turn	Pakistan	into	the	leader	of	the	Muslim	 world
and	 foster	 an	  Islamic	  opposition	  in	  Central	 Asia.	  Washington	  wanted	 to
demonstrate	that	  the	 entire	  Muslim	  world	  was	  fighting	  the	 Soviet	  Union
alongside	the	Afghans	 and	their	 American	 benefactors.	And	the	 Saudis	saw	an
opportunity	 both	to	 promote	Wahabbism	and	 get	rid	 of	its	 disgruntled	radicals.
None	of	 the	 players	 reckoned	on	 these	volunteers	 having	 their	 own	 agendas,
which	 would	  eventually	 turn	  their	 hatred	 against	 the	 Soviets	 on	 their	  own
regimes	and	the	Americans.
       Pakistan	 already	 had	standing	 instructions	 to	 all	 its	 embassies	abroad	to
give	visas,	with	 no	 questions	asked,	to	anyone	wanting	 to	come	 and	fight	 with
the	Mujaheddin.	 In	 the	Middle	 East,	the	 Muslim	 Brotherhood,	 the	Saudi-based

168
World	 Muslim	  League	and	 Palestinian	Islamic	 radicals	 organized	 the	recruits
and	put	them	into	 contact	with	 the	Pakistanis.	The	 ISI	 and	Pakistan's	Jamaat-e-
Islami	 set	up	 reception	 committees	 to	welcome,	 house	 and	train	 the	 arriving
militants	 and	then	encouraged	them	to	join	 the	 Mujaheddin	 groups,	usually	 the
Hizb-e-Islami.	   The	  funds	  for	   this	  enterprise	  came	 directly	   from	   Saudi
Intelligence.	French	scholar	Olivier	  Roy	describes	it	as	‘a	 joint	 venture	between
the	Saudis,	the	Muslim	Brotherhood	and	the	Jamaat-e-Islami,	put	together	by	the
ISI’.2
       Between	 1982	 and	 1992	some	 35,000	 Muslim	 radicals	 from	  43	 Islamic
countries	in	 the	Middle	  East,	North	 and	East	Africa,	  Central	Asia	 and	the	 Far
East	would	pass	their	 baptism	under	fire	 with	 the	Afghan	 Mujaheddin.	 Tens	of
thousands	more	foreign	Muslim	  radicals	came	to	 study	in	 the	hundreds	of	 new
madrassas	that	Zia's	military	  government	 began	to	fund	 in	 Pakistan	and	along
the	Afghan	border.	Eventually	 more	than	100,000	 Muslim	 radicals	were	to	have
direct	contact	with	Pakistan	and	Afghanistan	and	be	influenced	by	the	jihad.
       In	 camps	near	Peshawar	and	in	Afghanistan,	 these	radicals	met	each	other
for	 the	 first	  time	 and	 studied,	 trained	 and	 fought	 together.	 It	  was	 the	 first
opportunity	  for	 most	  of	 them	  to	 learn	  about	 Islamic	  movements	 in	 other
countries	and	they	 forged	 tactical	and	 ideological	 links	 that	 would	 serve	them
well	 in	 the	 future.	 The	 camps	 became	virtual	  universities	 for	 future	  Islamic
radicalism.	None	 of	 the	intelligence	  agencies	involved	 wanted	to	 consider	 the
consequences	of	bringing	 together	thousands	of	 Islamic	 radicals	 from	 all	 over
the	world.	‘What	 was	more	important	 in	the	 world	view	 of	 history?	The	Taliban
or	the	fall	 of	 the	Soviet	 Empire?	A	 few	 stirred-up	Muslims	  or	the	liberation	 of
Central	 Europe	and	 the	 end	of	 the	 Cold	 War?’	  said	 Zbigniew	 Brzezinski,	  a
former	US	 National	 Security	 Adviser.3	American	 citizens	 only	 woke	up	 to	the
consequences	when	Afghanistan-trained	 Islamic	  militants	 blew	  up	the	 World
Trade	Centre	in	New	York	 in	1993,	killing	 six	 people	and	injuring	1,000.
       ‘The	  war,’	 wrote	 Samuel	Huntington,	 ‘left	  behind	 an	uneasy	coalition	  of
Islamist	organizations	intent	 on	promoting	 Islam	 against	all	non-Muslim	  forces.
It	 also	 left	 a	 legacy	 of	 expert	 and	 experienced	fighters,	  training	 camps	 and
logistical	 facilities,	 elaborate	trans-Islam	networks	 of	personal	and	 organization
relationships,	a	substantial	 amount	of	 military	 equipment	 including	 300	 to	500
unaccounted-for	Stinger	missiles,	 and,	most	important,	 a	heady	 sense	of	power
and	self-confidence	over	 what	had	been	achieved	and	 a	driving	 desire	to	 move
on	to	other	victories.’4
       Most	 of	 these	radicals	speculated	that	if	the	Afghan	 jihad	had	defeated	one

169
superpower,	the	Soviet	Union,	 could	 they	not	also	 defeat	the	other	superpower,
the	US	 and	their	 own	 regimes?	The	 logic	 of	 this	 argument	was	 based	on	the
simple	premise	 that	the	Afghan	 jihad	 alone	 had	brought	 the	Soviet	 state	to	its
knees.	The	 multiple	 internal	  reasons	which	 led	 to	 the	collapse	 of	 the	 Soviet
system,	of	which	 the	 jihad	was	 only	one,	 were	conveniently	 ignored.	 So	while
the	USA	 saw	 the	collapse	of	 the	 Soviet	 state	as	the	failure	  of	the	 communist
system,	many	Muslims	  saw	it	 solely	 as	a	 victory	 for	 Islam.	 For	 militants	 this
belief	was	inspiring	 and	deeply	evocative	of	 the	Muslim	 sweep	across	the	world
in	the	seventh	and	eighth	 centuries.	A	 new	Islamic	 Ummah,	they	 argued,	could
be	forged	by	 the	sacrifices	and	blood	 of	 a	new	generation	of	 martyrs	and	more
such	victories.
       Amongst	  these	thousands	of	 foreign	 recruits	 was	 a	young	 Saudi	 student
Osama	Bin	Laden,	 the	son	of	 a	Yemeni	 construction	 magnate	Mohammed	Bin
Laden	who	was	 a	close	friend	 of	 the	late	King	 Faisal	 and	whose	company	had
become	fabulously	 wealthy	 on	the	 contracts	to	 renovate	and	 expand	the	Holy
Mosques	of	 Mecca	 and	 Medina.	 The	 ISI	 had	 long	 wanted	 Prince	Turki	  Bin
Faisal,	the	 head	 of	 Istakhbarat,	 the	 Saudi	 Intelligence	 Service,	 to	 provide	  a
Royal	 Prince	 to	  lead	 the	 Saudi	 contingent	  in	 order	  to	 show	 Muslims	  the
commitment	of	the	Royal	 Family	to	the	jihad.	 Only	poorer	Saudis,	students,	taxi-
drivers	 and	Bedouin	 tribesmen	 had	so	 far	 arrived	 to	 fight.	 But	  no	pampered
Saudi	Prince	 was	ready	 to	rough	 it	 out	 in	 the	Afghan	 mountains.	 Bin	 Laden,
although	 not	 a	royal,	  was	close	 enough	 to	 the	 royals	 and	 certainly	 wealthy
enough	to	lead	the	Saudi	 contingent.	Bin	 Laden,	Prince	 Turki	 and	General	Gul
were	to	become	firm	friends	and	allies	in	a	common	cause.
       The	 centre	 for	 the	 Arab-Afghans	  was	the	 offices	 of	  the	World	  Muslim
League	and	the	Muslim	  Brotherhood	 in	Peshawar	which	 was	run	 by	 Abdullah
Azam,	a	 Jordanian	Palestinian	whom	 Bin	 Laden	 had	first	 met	 at	university	  in
Jeddah	and	revered	as	his	leader.	Azam	and	his	two	sons	were	assassinated	by	a
bomb	blast	in	Peshawar	in	1989.	During	 the	1980s	Azam	 had	forged	close	links
with	Hikmetyar	 and	Abdul	 Rasul	Sayyaf,	the	Afghan	 Islamic	 scholar,	whom	the
Saudis	had	sent	 to	 Peshawar	to	 promote	 Wahabbism.	 Saudi	funds	 flowed	  to
Azam	and	the	Makhtab	al	Khid-mat	 or	Services	Centre	which	he	created	in	1984
to	 service	 the	  new	 recruits	  and	 receive	  donations	 from	  Islamic	  charities.
Donations	from	 Saudi	Intelligence,	 the	Saudi	 Red	Crescent,	the	World	 Muslim
League	and	private	donations	from	 Saudi	princes	and	mosques	were	channelled
through	the	Makhtab.	A	 decade	later	the	Makhtab	would	 emerge	at	the	centre	of
a	web	 of	 radical	 organizations	 that	helped	 carry	 out	 the	World	  Trade	Centre

170
bombing	and	the	bombings	of	US	Embassies	in	Africa	in	 1998.
       Until	 he	arrived	 in	Afghanistan,	Bin	 Laden's	life	had	hardly	been	marked	by
anything	extraordinary.	 He	was	born	around	 1957,	the	17th	of	 57	children	 sired
by	his	Yemeni	 father	and	a	Saudi	mother,	one	of	Mohammed	 Bin	Laden's	many
wives.	 Bin	 Laden	 studied	for	  a	Masters	 degree	in	 business	administration	  at
King	 Abdul	  Aziz	 University	  in	 Jeddah	but	 soon	switched	 to	 Islamic	 studies.
Thin	and	tall,	 he	is	six	 feet	five	 inches,	with	long	 limbs	 and	a	flowing	 beard,	he
towered	above	 his	 contemporaries	 who	 remember	 him	 as	a	 quiet	 and	 pious
individual	 but	hardly	marked	out	for	 greater	things.5
       His	  father	backed	 the	Afghan	  struggle	 and	helped	 fund	 it,	 so	when	 Bin
Laden	 decided	 to	  join	  up,	 his	  family	  responded	 enthusiastically.	  He	 first
travelled	 to	  Peshawar	in	  1980	 and	 met	  the	 Mujaheddin	  leaders,	 returning
frequently	 with	 Saudi	 donations	for	 the	 cause	until	 1982	 when	he	 decided	to
settle	in	Peshawar.	He	brought	in	his	company	engineers	and	heavy	construction
equipment	to	help	build	 roads	and	depots	for	the	Mujaheddin.	In	 1986	he	helped
build	 the	Khost	 tunnel	 complex,	which	  the	CIA	 was	 funding	 as	a	major	 arms
storage	depot,	 training	 facility	  and	 medical	 centre	 for	 the	 Mujaheddin,	  deep
under	the	mountains	close	to	the	 Pakistan	border.	For	the	first	 time	 in	Khost	 he
set	up	his	own	training	 camp	for	 Arab	 Afghans,	who	 now	increasingly	 saw	this
lanky,	wealthy	and	charismatic	Saudi	as	their	leader.
       ‘To	   counter	  these	  atheist	 Russians,	  the	  Saudis	 chose	  me	  as	 their
representative	in	Afghanistan,’	 Bin	 Laden	said	later.	‘I	 settled	in	 Pakistan	in	the
Afghan	 border	region.	 There	 I	 received	volunteers	 who	 came	from	 the	 Saudi
Kingdom	 and	from	 all	 over	 the	Arab	 and	 Muslim	 countries.	 I	 set	up	 my	first
camp	where	these	volunteers	were	 trained	by	 Pakistani	and	 American	officers.
The	weapons	 were	 supplied	 by	 the	 Americans,	 the	 money	 by	 the	 Saudis.	 I
discovered	that	 it	 was	not	 enough	to	 fight	 in	 Afghanistan,	 but	 that	we	 had	to
fight	on	all	 fronts,	communist	or	Western	oppression,’	he	added.6
       Bin	  Laden	 later	 claimed	 to	 have	taken	 part	 in	 ambushes	against	Soviet
troops,	but	he	mainly	 used	his	wealth	 and	Saudi	donations	to	build	 Mujaheddin
projects	and	spread	Wahabbism	amongst	the	Afghans.	 After	 the	death	of	Azam
in	1989,	he	took	over	Azam's	 organization	and	set	up	Al	 Qaeda	or	Military	 Base
as	a	service	 centre	for	 Arab-Afghans	  and	their	 familes	 and	 to	forge	 a	 broad-
based	alliance	amongst	them.	With	the	help	of	Bin	Laden,	several	thousand	Arab
militants	  had	 established	 bases	 in	  the	 provinces	  of	  Kunar,	  Nuristan	  and
Badakhshan,	but	their	extreme	Wahabbi	 practices	made	them	intensely	 disliked
by	 the	majority	  of	 Afghans.	  Moreover	 by	 allying	  themselves	with	  the	 most

171
extreme	pro-Wahabbi	Pashtun	Mujaheddin,	the	Arab-Afghans	 alienated	the	non-
Pashtuns	and	the	Shia	Muslims.
       Ahmed	 Shah	 Masud	later	 criticized	 the	 Arab-Afghans.	 ‘My	  jihad	 faction
did	not	have	good	 relations	with	 the	Arab-Afghans	 during	 the	years	of	jihad.	 In
contrast	they	had	 very	good	 relations	with	 the	 factions	of	 Abdul	 Rasul	 Sayyaf
and	Gulbuddin	 Hikmetyar.	 When	my	 faction	 entered	Kabul	 in	 1992,	the	Arab-
Afghans	fought	 in	the	ranks	of	 Hikmetyar's	 forces	against	us.	We	will	 ask	them
(Arabs)	to	leave	our	country.	Bin	 Laden	does	more	harm	than	good,’	Masud	said
in	1997	after	he	had	been	ousted	from	Kabul	by	the	Taliban.7
       By	  1990	 Bin	  Laden	 was	disillusioned	  by	 the	 internal	  bickering	 of	  the
Mujaheddin	and	he	returned	to	 Saudi	Arabia	to	 work	in	 the	family	 business.	He
founded	a	welfare	organization	 for	Arab-Afghan	  veterans,	some	4,000	of	whom
had	settled	in	Mecca	and	Medina	alone,	and	gave	money	to	the	families	 of	those
killed.	After	 Iraq's	invasion	 of	Kuwait	 he	lobbied	the	Royal	 Family	to	 organize	a
popular	defence	of	the	Kingdom	 and	raise	a	force	from	 the	Afghan	war	 veterans
to	fight	  Iraq.	 Instead	 King	 Fahd	 invited	 in	  the	Americans.	 This	  came	as	an
enormous	shock	to	 Bin	 Laden.	As	 the	540,000	US	 troops	began	to	 arrive,	Bin
Laden	openly	 criticized	  the	Royal	 Family,	 lobbying	  the	Saudi	 ulema	to	 issue
fatwas,	religious	rulings,	against	non-Muslims	 being	based	in	the	country.
       Bin	 Laden's	 criticism	 escalated	after	some	20,000	 US	troops	 continued	to
be	based	 in	 Saudi	 Arabia	 after	 Kuwait's	  liberation.	  In	 1992	 he	 had	a	 fiery
meeting	with	 Interior	  Minister	 Prince	 Naif	 whom	 he	called	 a	 traitor	 to	Islam.
Naif	 complained	to	 King	 Fahd	and	Bin	 Laden	was	declared	persona	non	grata.
Nevertheless	he	still	had	allies	in	the	Royal	Family,	 who	also	disliked	 Naif	 while
he	maintained	his	links	with	 both	Saudi	Intelligence	and	the	ISI.
       In	  1992	Bin	  Laden	left	 for	  Sudan	to	 take	part	 in	 the	 Islamic	 revolution
underway	 there	 under	 the	 charismatic	 Sudanese	leader	 Hassan	 Turabi.	 Bin
Laden's	continued	criticism	 of	the	Saudi	Royal	 Family	 eventually	annoyed	them
so	much	 that	they	 took	 the	 unprecedented	step	of	 revoking	 his	 citizenship	 in
1994.	It	 was	 in	 Sudan,	with	 his	 wealth	 and	contacts	that	 Bin	 Laden	 gathered
around	him	 more	 veterans	of	 the	Afghan	 war,	 who	 were	 all	 disgusted	by	 the
American	 victory	  over	 Iraq	  and	 the	 attitude	 of	 the	 Arab	  ruling	  elites	 who
allowed	 the	 US	 military	  to	 remain	 in	  the	 Gulf.	 As	  US	 and	Saudi	 pressure
mounted	 against	Sudan	 for	 harbouring	  Bin	 Laden,	  the	Sudanese	authorities
asked	him	to	leave.
       In	 May	1996	Bin	 Laden	travelled	back	to	 Afghanistan,	arriving	 in	Jalalabad
in	a	chartered	jet	with	 an	entourage	of	dozens	of	Arab	militants,	 bodyguards	and

172
family	 members	including	 three	wives	and	13	 children.	Here	he	lived	 under	the
protection	of	 the	Jalalabad	Shura	until	 the	 conquest	of	Kabul	 and	 Jalalabad	by
the	 Taliban	  in	  September	1996.	  In	  August	  1996	 he	 had	  issued	 his	 first
declaration	of	jihad	 against	the	Americans	whom	 he	said	were	occupying	 Saudi
Arabia.	‘The	 walls	 of	 oppression	and	humiliation	  cannot	be	demolished	except
in	a	rain	 of	 bullets,’	 the	declaration	 read.	Striking	 up	a	 friendship	 with	 Mullah
Omar,	in	 1997	 he	 moved	to	 Kandahar	 and	came	 under	the	 protection	 of	 the
Taliban.
       By	 now	 the	CIA	 had	set	up	 a	special	cell	 to	monitor	 his	 activities	 and	his
links	with	 other	Islamic	 militants.	A	 US	State	Department	report	in	August	 1996
noted	that	 Bin	 Laden	 was	 ‘one	 of	 the	 most	significant	  financial	  sponsors	of
Islamic	 extremist	activities	  in	the	 world’.	  The	report	 said	that	 Bin	 Laden	 was
financing	  terrorist	  camps	  in	  Somalia,	  Egypt,	  Sudan,	 Yemen,	  Egypt	  and
Afghanistan.	 In	 April	  1996,	 President	Clinton	  signed	the	 Anti-Terrorism	  Act
which	allowed	 the	US	to	block	 assets	of	terrorist	organizations.	It	 was	first	 used
to	block	Bin	 Laden's	access	to	his	fortune	of	an	estimated	US$250-300	million.8
A	few	 months	later	 Egyptian	 intelligence	 declared	that	Bin	 Laden	was	training
1,000	militants,	 a	second	generation	of	Arab-Afghans,	 to	bring	 about	an	Islamic
revolution	in	 Arab	countries.9
       In	 early	1997	the	CIA	 constituted	 a	squad	which	arrived	in	 Peshawar	to	try
and	carry	 out	 a	 snatch	operation	 to	 get	 Bin	  Laden	out	 of	  Afghanistan.	 The
Americans	 enlisted	  Afghans	 and	  Pakistanis	 to	 help	  them	 but	  aborted	 the
operation.	The	US	 activity	 in	 Peshawar	helped	persuade	Bin	Laden	to	 move	to
the	safer	 confines	 of	  Kandahar.	On	 23	 February	 1998,	 at	 a	 meeting	 in	 the
original	Khost	 camp,	all	the	groups	associated	with	Al	 Qaeda	issued	a	manifesto
under	the	aegis	of	 ‘The	 International	 Islamic	  Front	for	 jihad	 against	Jews	and
Crusaders’.	The	manifesto	 stated	‘for	  more	than	 seven	years	the	US	 has	been
occupying	 the	lands	of	 Islam	 in	 the	 holiest	of	 places,	 the	Arabian	 peninsular,
plundering	its	riches,	 dictating	to	its	 rulers,	humiliating	 its	 people,	terrorizing	 its
neighbours,	and	 turning	 its	 bases	in	 the	 peninsular	 into	 a	 spearhead	through
which	to	fight	 the	neighbouring	Muslim	 peoples’.
       The	 meeting	 issued	a	 fatwa.	 ‘The	 ruling	 to	 kill	  the	Americans	 and	 their
allies	–	civilians	 and	military	  –	is	an	individual	  duty	for	 every	Muslim	 who	 can
do	it	in	 any	country	in	 which	it	 is	possible	to.’	 Bin	 Laden	had	now	formulated	 a
policy	 that	was	not	just	 aimed	at	the	 Saudi	Royal	Family	  or	the	Americans	 but
called	for	 the	liberation	 of	the	 entire	Muslim	 Middle	  East.	As	the	American	 air
war	against	Iraq	escalated	in	1998,	Bin	Laden	called	on	all	Muslims	 to	‘confront,

173
fight	and	kill’	  Americans	and	Britons.10
       However,	  it	 was	the	 bombings	 in	 August	 1998	 of	 the	US	 Embassies	in
Kenya	and	Tanzania	that	killed	 220	 people	which	made	Bin	 Laden	a	household
name	in	the	Muslim	  world	 and	the	West.	Just	13	 days	later,	after	 accusing	Bin
Laden	of	perpetrating	 the	attack,	the	USA	 retaliated	by	firing	  70	cruise	missiles
against	Bin	 Laden's	camps	around	 Khost	 and	Jalalabad.	Several	 camps	which
had	been	handed	over	by	the	Taliban	to	 the	Arab-Afghans	 and	Pakistani	radical
groups	were	hit.	The	Al	 Badr	 camp	controlled	 by	Bin	 Laden	and	the	Khalid	 bin
Walid	and	Muawia	 camps	run	 by	the	Pakistani	Harakat	 ul	Ansar	 were	the	main
targets.	Harakat	used	their	camps	to	train	 militants	 for	 fighting	 Indian	 troops	in
Kashmir.	 Seven	 outsiders	 were	  killed	  in	  the	 strike	 –	  three	 Yemenis,	 two
Egyptians,	one	Saudi	 and	one	Turk.	 Also	 killed	  were	seven	Pakistanis	 and	20
Afghans.
       In	 November	1998	the	USA	 offered	a	US$5-million	  reward	for	Bin	 Laden's
capture.	The	Americans	were	further	galvanized	 when	Bin	 Laden	claimed	that	it
was	his	Islamic	duty	 to	acquire	chemical	and	nuclear	weapons	to	use	against	the
USA.	 ‘It	 would	  be	a	 sin	for	  Muslims	 not	 to	 try	 to	 possess	the	weapons	that
would	 prevent	 infidels	  from	  inflicting	   harm	 on	 Muslims.	  Hostility	   towards
America	is	a	religious	duty	 and	we	hope	to	be	rewarded	for	it	by	God,’	he	said.11
       Within	  a	few	weeks	of	the	Africa	 bombings,	 the	Clinton	administration	 had
demonized	Bin	Laden	 to	the	point	 of	blaming	 him	 for	every	 atrocity	committed
against	the	  USA	 in	  the	 Muslim	  world	  in	  recent	 times.	 In	  the	 subsequent
indictment	against	him	 by	a	New	 York	 court,	Bin	 Laden	was	blamed	for	 the	18
American	 soldiers	 killed	 in	  Mogadishu,	 Somalia	 in	 1993;	 the	 deaths	of	 five
servicemen	in	a	bomb	attack	in	Riyadh	 in	1995	and	the	deaths	of	another	19	US
soldiers	 in	 Dhahran	 in	  1996.	 He	 was	 also	 suspected	 of	 having	  a	 hand	 in
bombings	in	 Aden	 in	1992,	 the	World	 Trade	 Centre	bombing	 in	 1993,	a	1994
plot	to	kill	 President	Clinton	 in	the	Phillipines	 and	a	plan	to	blow	 up	a	dozen	US
civilian	 aircraft	 in	 1995.12	There	was	a	great	deal	of	 scepticism,	even	 amongst
US	experts	that	he	was	involved	in	many	of	these	latter	operations.13
       But	 the	Clinton	 administration	 was	desperately	looking	for	 a	diversion	as	it
wallowed	 through	the	 mire	of	 the	 Monica	 Lewinsky	 affair	 and	also	 needed	an
all-purpose,	simple	explanation	for	 unexplained	terrorist	acts.	Bin	 Laden	became
the	centre	 of	 what	  was	promulgated	 by	  Washington	 as	a	 global	  conspiracy
against	the	 USA.	 What	 Washington	 was	 not	 prepared	to	 admit	 was	 that	 the
Afghan	  jihad,	   with	   the	  support	  of	  the	  CIA,	   had	  spawned	  dozens	 of
fundamentalist	movements	across	the	Muslim	world	 which	 were	led	by	militants

who	had	grievances,	not	so	much	 against	the	Americans,	but	 their	own	 corrupt,
incompetent	regimes.	As	early	 as	1992-93	Egyptian	 and	Algerian	 leaders	at	the
highest	  level	   had	  advised	  Washington	   to	   re-engage	  diplomatically	    in
Afghanistan	in	 order	to	bring	about	peace	so	as	to	end	the	presence	of	the	Arab-
Afghans.	Washington	ignored	 the	warnings	and	continued	to	ignore	Afghanistan
even	as	the	civil	war	there	escalated.14
       The	 Algerians	were	justified	 in	 their	fears,	for	 the	first	major	 eruption	from
the	ranks	of	 the	Arab-Afghans	  came	in	Algeria.	  In	1991	 the	Islamic	 Salvation
Front	(FIS)	 won	 the	first	 round	 of	 parliamentary	 elections	taking	 some	60	 per
cent	of	the	seats	countrywide.	The	Algerian	 army	 cancelled	the	results,	declared
Presidential	rule	 in	 January	 1992	and	 within	  two	 months	a	 vicious	 civil	  war
began	 which	  had	  claimed	  some	  70,000	  lives	  by	  1999.	  FIS	  itself	  was
outmanoeuvered	by	the	more	extreme	Islamic	 Jihad,	which	 in	 1995	changed	its
name	to	the	Armed	 Islamic	 Group	(GIA).	  GIA	 was	led	 by	Algerian	 Afghans	 –
Algerian	 veterans	from	 the	Afghan	 war	 –	who	 were	 neo-Wahabbis	and	set	an
agenda	that	was	to	plunge	Algeria	into	a	bloodbath,	 destabilize	North	Africa	 and
lead	to	the	growth	 of	Islamic	 extremism	 in	France.	Algeria	 was	only	 a	foretaste
of	what	 was	 to	come	 later.	Bombings	 carried	 out	 in	 Egypt	by	 Islamic	 groups
were	also	traced	back	to	Egyptian	veterans	trained	in	Afghanistan.
       Bin	 Laden	 knew	 many	of	 the	perpetrators	of	 these	violent	 acts	across	the
Muslim	 world,	 because	they	had	lived	 and	fought	 together	in	 Afghanistan.	 His
organization,	focused	 around	supporting	 veterans	of	 the	Afghan	 war	 and	 their
families,	maintained	contacts	with	 them.	He	may	well	 have	funded	some	of	their
operations,	but	he	was	unlikely	  to	know	 what	they	 were	all	 up	to	 or	what	 their
domestic	 agendas	 were.	 Bin	  Laden	  has	 always	 been	  insecure	 within	  the
architecture	of	 Islam.	 He	 is	neither	 an	Islamic	  scholar	nor	 a	teacher	and	 thus
cannot	legally	  issue	fatwas	 -although	 he	 does	so.	In	  the	West	 his	 ‘Death	 to
America’	 appeals	have	been	read	as	fatwas,	even	though	they	do	not	carry	moral
weight	in	the	Muslim	 world.
       Arab-Afghans	   who	  knew	  him	  during	  the	  jihad	  say	  he	 was	  neither
intellectual	nor	 articulate	about	what	needed	to	be	done	in	the	Muslim	  world.	 In
that	sense	he	was	neither	 the	 Lenin	 of	 the	Islamic	 revolution,	  nor	was	 he	the
internationalist	ideologue	 of	the	 Islamic	revolution	 such	as	Che	Guevera	was	to
revolution	in	 the	third	world.
       Bin	  Laden's	 former	  associates	describe	 him	  as	 deeply	 impressionable,
always	in	the	need	for	 mentors	–	men	who	knew	 more	about	both	Islam	and	the
modern	world	than	he	did.	To	the	long	list	 of	mentors	during	his	 youth	were	later

175
added	Dr	Aiman	al-Zawahiri,	  the	head	of	the	banned	Islamic	Jihad	in	Egypt	 and
the	two	sons	of	Shaikh	Omar	Abdel	Rehman,	the	blind	Egyptian	 preacher	now	in
a	US	jail	 for	 the	World	 Trade	 Centre	bombing	 and	who	had	 led	the	banned	El
Gamaa	Islamiyya	 in	  Egypt.	 Through	 the	 Afghan	 jihad,	  he	also	 knew	 senior
figures	in	 the	 National	 Islamic	 Front	in	 the	 Sudan,	Hezbollah	 in	Lebanon	 and
Hamas,	the	radical	Islamic	Palestinian	movement	in	 Gaza	and	the	West	Bank.	In
Kandahar	 he	  had	 Chechens,	 Bangladeshis,	  Filipinos,	  Algerians,	  Kenyans,
Pakistanis	and	 African-American	  Muslims	  with	  him	 –	 many	 of	 whom	  were
widely	 read	and	 better	informed	 than	 Bin	 Laden,	but	 could	 not	 travel	 outside
Afghanistan	 because	they	 were	 on	 US	 wanted	 lists.	 What	 they	 needed	 was
financial	support	and	a	sanctuary	which	Bin	Laden	gave	them.
       After	 the	Africa	 bombings	 the	US	launched	a	truely	global	 operation.	More
than	80	Islamic	 militants	 were	arrested	in	 a	dozen	different	 countries.	Militants
were	picked	up	 in	a	crescent	running	 from	Tanzania,	 Kenya,	Sudan,	Yemen,	to
Pakistan,	Bangladesh,	Malaysia	and	the	Phillipines.15	In	December	1998,	Indian
authorities	detained	Bangladeshi	militants	for	 plotting	 to	bomb	the	US	Consulate
in	Calcutta.	Seven	Afghan	nationals	using	false	Italian	 passports	were	arrested	in
Malaysia	and	accused	of	trying	 to	start	a	bombing	campaign.16	According	to	the
FBI,	militants	 in	 Yemen	who	 kidnapped	16	Western	tourists	 in	December	1998
were	funded	by	Bin	Laden.17	In	February	1999,	Bangladeshi	authorities	said	Bin
Laden	had	 sent	US$1	 million	  to	 the	Harkat-ul-Jihad	 (HJ)	 in	 Dhaka,	 some	 of
whose	members	had	 trained	 and	fought	 in	 Afghanistan.	  HJ	leaders	 said	they
wanted	to	turn	Bangladesh	into	a	Taliban-style	Islamic	 state.18
       Thousands	of	 miles	away	in	 Nouakchott,	 the	capital	of	 Mauritania	 in	West
Africa,	 several	militants	 were	arrested	who	had	also	trained	under	Bin	 Laden	in
Afghanistan	 and	 were	 suspected	of	  plotting	  bomb	 explosions.19	Meanwhile
during	the	trial	 of	 107	Al-Jihad	 members	at	 a	military	 court	 in	Cairo,	 Egyptian
intelligence	 officers	  testified	  that	 Bin	  Laden	 had	 bankrolled	  Al-Jihad.20	 In
February	  1999	  the	  CIA	   claimed	  that	   through	  monitoring	   Bin	   Laden's
communication	 network	 by	 satellite,	 they	 had	 prevented	 his	 supporters	from
carrying	out	 seven	bomb	attacks	against	US	overseas	facilities	 in	Saudi	Arabia,
Albania,	  Azerbaijan,	  Tajikistan,	  Uganda,	 Uruguay	  and	 the	  Ivory	  Coast	 –
emphasizing	 the	 reach	 of	 the	 Afghan	  veterans.	 The	 Clinton	  administration
sanctioned	US$6.7	billion	  to	 fight	 terrorism	 in	 1999,	while	  the	FBI's	 counter-
terrorism	budget	grew	 from	 US$118	million	  to	US$286	million	  and	the	agency
allocated	2,650	agents	to	the	task,	twice	the	number	in	1998.

176
       But	 it	 was	 Pakistan	and	Saudi	 Arabia,	 the	original	 sponsors	of	 the	 Arab-
Afghans,	who	 suffered	 the	most	 as	their	 activities	 rebounded.	In	 March	 1997,
three	Arab	 and	two	 Tajik	  militants	 were	 shot	dead	after	 a	36-hour	 gun	 battle
between	them	  and	 the	 police	  in	 an	 Afghan	  refugee	 camp	 near	 Peshawar.
Belonging	to	 the	Wahabbi	radical	 Tafkir	 group,	they	 were	planning	to	 bomb	an
Islamic	heads	of	state	meeting	in	Islamabad.
       With	  the	 encouragement	of	 Pakistan,	the	 Taliban	 and	 Bin	 Laden,	 Arab-
Afghans	had	enlisted	in	 the	Pakistani	party	 Harkat-ul-Ansar	 to	fight	 in	 Kashmir
against	Indian	troops.	 By	 inducting	 Arabs	who	 introduced	 Wahabbi-style	 rules
in	 the	  Kashmir	  valley,	  genuine	 Kashmiri	   militants	  felt	  insulted.	  The	 US
government	 had	declared	 Ansar	 a	 terrorist	  organization	 in	 1996	 and	 it	  had
subsequently	changed	 its	  name	 to	 Harkat-ul-Mujaheddin.	   All	  the	 Pakistani
victims	 of	 the	US	missile	 strikes	 on	Khost	 belonged	to	 Ansar.	In	 1999,	 Ansar
said	it	would	impose	a	strict	 Wahabbi-style	dress	code	in	the	Kashmir	valley	 and
banned	jeans	and	jackets.	On	 15	February	 1999,	they	 shot	and	wounded	 three
Kashmiri	 cable	 television	 operators	 for	 relaying	 Western	 satellite	 broadcasts.
Ansar	had	previously	  respected	the	liberal	 traditions	 of	 Kashmiri	 Muslims	 but
the	activites	of	the	Arab-Afghans	 hurt	 the	legitimacy	 of	the	Kashmiri	 movement
and	gave	India	a	propaganda	coup.21
       Pakistan	 faced	a	problem	 when	Washington	 urged	 Prime	Minister	  Nawaz
Sharif	to	help	arrest	Bin	 Laden.	The	ISI's	 close	contacts	with	Bin	 Laden	and	the
fact	that	he	 was	helping	 fund	and	 train	Kashmiri	  militants	 who	were	 using	the
Khost	 camps,	created	 a	 dilemma	 for	 Sharif	  when	 he	visited	  Washington	 in
December	1998.	Sharif	side-stepped	the	issue	but	 other	Pakistani	officials	 were
more	brazen,	reminding	 their	American	 counterparts	how	 they	had	both	 helped
midwife	 Bin	Laden	in	the	1980s	and	the	Taliban	in	the	1990s.	Bin	 Laden	himself
pointed	to	 continued	support	 from	 some	elements	in	 the	 Pakistani	intelligence
services	 in	  an	 interview.	   ‘As	  for	  Pakistan	  there	 are	 some	  governmental
departments,	which,	by	 the	Grace	of	 God,	respond	to	the	 Islamic	 sentiments	of
the	masses	in	Pakistan.	This	is	reflected	in	sympathy	and	co-operation.	However,
some	other	governmental	departments	fell	 into	the	 trap	of	the	 infidels.	 We	pray
to	God	to	return	them	to	the	right	path,’	 said	Bin	Laden.22
       Support	 for	Bin	 Laden	 by	elements	within	 the	Pakistani	establishment	was
another	contradiction	in	 Pakistan's	Afghan	 policy,	 explored	fully	 in	 Chapter	14.
The	US	was	 Pakistan's	closest	ally	 with	 deep	links	 to	the	 military	 and	the	 ISI.
But	both	the	Taliban	and	Bin	 Laden	provided	sanctuary	and	training	facilities	 for
Kashmiri	 militants	  who	  were	 backed	 by	 Pakistan,	 and	 Islamabad	had	 little

177
interest	in	drying	 up	that	support.	Even	though	the	Americans	repeatedly	tried	 to
persuade	the	 ISI	  to	 co-operate	 in	  delivering	  Bin	  Laden,	 the	 ISI	  declined,
although	it	 did	 help	 the	US	 arrest	several	 of	 Bin	 Laden's	supporters.	Without
Pakistan's	support	the	USA	could	not	hope	to	launch	a	snatch	by	US	commandos
or	more	accurate	bombing	strikes	because	it	needed	Pakistani	territory	 to	launch
such	raids.	At	the	same	time	the	USA	dared	not	expose	Pakistan's	support	for	the
Taliban,	because	it	still	hoped	for	ISI	 co-operation	in	catching	Bin	 Laden.
       The	 Saudi	 conundrum	 was	 even	 worse.	In	  July	 1998	 Prince	 Turki	 had
visited	 Kandahar	 and	 a	few	  weeks	later	  400	 new	 pick-up	 trucks	 arrived	  in
Kandahar	for	 the	 Taliban,	 still	 bearing	 their	 Dubai	 license	plates.	 The	Saudis
also	gave	 cash	 for	 the	 Taliban's	 cheque	 book	 conquest	 of	 the	 north	 in	 the
autumn.	Until	 the	Africa	 bombings	and	despite	US	pressure	to	end	their	support
for	the	Taliban,	 the	Saudis	continued	funding	 the	Taliban	and	were	silent	 on	the
need	to	extradite	Bin	 Laden.23	The	truth	about	the	Saudi	silence	was	even	more
complicated.	 The	 Saudis	preferred	 to	 leave	 Bin	 Laden	 alone	 in	 Afghanistan
because	his	arrest	and	trial	by	the	Americans	could	 expose	the	deep	relationship
that	 Bin	 Laden	 continued	 to	  have	with	  sympathetic	 members	 of	 the	 Royal
Family	  and	 elements	 within	  Saudi	 intelligence,	  which	  could	  prove	 deeply
embarrassing.	The	 Saudis	wanted	 Bin	 Laden	 either	 dead	or	 a	 captive	 of	 the
Taliban	–	they	did	not	want	him	 captured	by	the	Americans.
       After	   the	 August	  1998	 Africa	  bombings,	  US	 pressure	 on	  the	 Saudis
increased.	Prince	Turki	visited	Kandahar	again,	this	time	 to	persuade	the	Taliban
to	hand	over	 Bin	 Laden.	 In	 their	meeting,	 Mullah	 Omar	 refused	to	 do	 so	and
then	insulted	  Prince	 Turki	  by	 abusing	 the	 Saudi	 Royal	 Family.	  Bin	  Laden
himself	 described	what	 took	 place.	‘He	 [Prince	 Turki]	  asked	Mullah	 Omar	 to
surrender	us	home	or	to	expel	us	from	 Afghanistan.	It	 is	none	of	the	business	of
the	Saudi	regime	to	come	and	ask	for	 the	handing	 over	of	Osama	Bin	 Laden.	It
was	as	if	Turki	 came	as	an	envoy	of	the	American	government.’24	Furious	about
the	Taliban	 insults,	the	Saudis	suspended	diplomatic	 relations	 with	 the	Taliban
and	 ostensibly	  ceased	 all	  aid	  to	 them,	  although	  they	  did	  not	  withdraw
recognition	of	the	Taliban	 government.
       By	 now	 Bin	Laden	 had	developed	considerable	influence	with	 the	Taliban,
but	that	 had	 not	always	 been	 the	case.	The	 Taliban's	 contact	 with	 the	 Arab-
Afghans	 and	 their	 Pan-Islamic	  ideology	  was	 non-existent	 until	  the	 Taliban
captured	Kabul	in	1996.	Pakistan	was	closely	involved	 in	 introducing	Bin	 Laden
to	the	Taliban	leaders	in	Kandahar,	because	it	wanted	to	retain	the	Khost	training
camps	for	Kashmiri	 militants,	 which	 were	now	 in	Taliban	 hands.	Persuasion	by

178
Pakistan,	the	Taliban's	better-educated	cadres,	who	 also	had	Pan-Islamic	 ideas,
and	the	 lure	  of	 financial	  benefits	 from	  Bin	 Laden,	 encouraged	 the	 Taliban
leaders	to	meet	with	Bin	Laden	and	hand	him	back	the	Khost	camps.
       Partly	 for	 his	own	 safety	and	 partly	to	 keep	control	 over	him,	 the	Taliban
shifted	Bin	 Laden	to	 Kandahar	in	 1997.	At	 first	 he	lived	 as	a	paying	guest.	He
built	 a	house	 for	 Mullah	  Omar's	family	  and	provided	  funds	to	 other	 Taliban
leaders.	He	promised	 to	 pave	the	 road	from	  Kandahar	airport	 to	 the	city	  and
build	 mosques,	schools	and	dams	but	 his	 civic	 works	 never	got	 started	as	his
funds	were	frozen.	While	 Bin	 Laden	lived	 in	 enormous	style	in	a	huge	mansion
in	 Kandahar	  with	  his	  family,	  servants	 and	  fellow	  militants,	   the	 arrogant
behaviour	of	 the	Arab-Afghans	 who	 arrived	with	  him	and	 their	failure	 to	 fulfil
any	of	their	civic	 projects,	antagonized	the	local	population.	The	Kandaharis	saw
the	Taliban	leaders	as	beneficiaries	of	Arab	largesse	rather	than	the	people.
       Bin	  Laden	endeared	himself	 further	 to	 the	 leadership	by	 sending	 several
hundred	Arab-Afghans	to	 participate	in	the	1997	 and	1998	Taliban	offensives	in
the	north.	These	Wahabbi	fighters	helped	the	Taliban	 carry	out	 the	massacres	of
the	Shia	 Hazaras	 in	 the	 north.	 Several	 hundred	Arab-Afghans,	  based	in	  the
Rishkor	army	 garrison	outside	Kabul,	 fought	on	 the	Kabul	front	 against	Masud.
Increasingly,	 Bin	  Laden's	world	  view	  appeared	to	 dominate	 the	 thinking	  of
senior	 Taliban	 leaders.	 All-night	  conversations	 between	 Bin	  Laden	 and	 the
Taliban	leaders	paid	 off.	 Until	  his	arrival	  the	Taliban	 leadership	had	not	 been
particularly	 antagonistic	to	 the	USA	 or	 the	West	but	 demanded	recognition	for
their	government.
       However,	  after	  the	 Africa	  bombings	  the	 Taliban	  became	 increasingly
vociferous	 against	 the	 Americans,	 the	 UN,	 the	 Saudis	 and	 Muslim	  regimes
around	 the	 world.	  Their	  statements	 increasingly	  reflected	 the	  language	 of
defiance	Bin	Laden	had	adopted	and	which	 was	not	an	original	 Taliban	trait.	 As
US	pressure	on	the	Taliban	 to	expel	 Bin	 Laden	intensified,	 the	Taliban	 said	he
was	a	 guest	 and	 it	  was	against	 Afghan	  tradition	  to	 expel	 guests.	 When	 it
appeared	that	 Washington	 was	 planning	  another	 military	  strike	 against	 Bin
Laden,	the	Taliban	 tried	to	 cut	a	deal	with	 Washington	 –	to	 allow	 him	to	 leave
the	country	 in	exchange	for	 US	 recognition.	 Thus	until	 the	 winter	 of	 1998	the
Taliban	saw	 Bin	 Laden	 as	an	asset,	a	bargaining	 chip	 over	 whom	 they	 could
negotiate	with	the	Americans.
       The	 US	State	Department	opened	a	satellite	telephone	connection	 to	speak
to	Mullah	  Omar	 directly.	 The	 Afghanistan	 desk	 officers,	 helped	 by	 a	Pushto
translator,	held	 lengthy	conversations	 with	 Omar	in	 which	 both	 sides	explored

179
various	options,	but	to	no	avail.25	By	early	1999	 it	began	to	dawn	on	the	Taliban
that	no	compromise	with	 the	US	 was	possible	and	they	began	to	see	Bin	 Laden
as	a	liability.	 A	US	 deadline	in	February	1999	to	 the	Taliban	to	either	hand	over
Bin	Laden	 or	face	 the	consequences	forced	the	Taliban	to	 make	him	 disappear
discreetly	from	Kandahar.	The	move	bought	the	Taliban	 some	time,	but	the	issue
was	still	nowhere	near	being	resolved.
       The	 Arab-Afghans	 had	 come	full	  circle.	 From	being	 mere	appendages	to
the	Afghan	jihad	 and	the	Cold	 War	in	 the	1980s	they	had	taken	centre	stage	for
the	Afghans,	neighbouring	 countries	 and	the	West	in	 the	1990s.	The	 USA	 was
now	paying	 the	price	 for	 ignoring	 Afghanistan	 between	1992	 and	1996,	 while
the	Taliban	 were	 providing	 sanctuary	to	 the	 most	hostile	 and	militant	  Islamic
fundamentalist	movement	the	world	 faced	in	the	post-Cold	War	era.	Afghanistan
was	 now	 truly	  a	 haven	 for	  Islamic	 internationalism	  and	 terrorism	  and	 the
Americans	and	the	West	were	at	a	loss	as	to	how	to	handle	it.

                      BARONS:	     THE	    TALIBAN	       AND
                           CENTRAL	       ASIA,	    RUSSIA,
                              TURKEY	      AND	   ISRAEL

	
In	Ashkhabad,	the	capital	of	Turkmenistan,	a	massive	new	international	airport
was	completed	in	1996.	The	enormous,	luxurious	terminal	building,	was	built	to
meet	the	expected	flow	of	Western	airlines	to	this	oil-	and	gas-rich	desert
Republic,	but	it	echoes	with	the	sounds	of	silence.	Within	months,	half	of	it	was
closed	down,	because	it	was	too	expensive	to	maintain	and	the	rest	–	with	only	a
few	weekly	flights	arriving	–	was	barely	used	even	in	1999.
      In	 1995	at	Sarakhs,	on	the	Turkmenistan-Iranian	border,	a	spanking	new
railway	station	with	marbled	walls	and	ticket	counters	was	completed.	The
howling	red	sand	and	shifting	dunes	of	the	Karakum	or	Black	Sand	desert	lapped
the	building	and	the	heat	was	stifling.	The	station	was	the	Turkmen	end	of	a	new
railway	line	built	by	the	Iranians,	which	connects	Meshad	in	north-eastern	Iran
with	Ashkhabad	–	the	first	direct	communications	link	between	Central	Asia	and
Muslim	countries	to	the	south	after	70	years	of	being	cut	off	from	each	other.
Yet	with	only	two	goods	and	passenger	trains	arriving	from	Iran	every	week,	the
station	is	closed	for	much	of	the	week.
      Communication	links	with	the	outside	world	were	a	top	priority	for	all	the
Central	Asian	Republics	(CARs)	after	they	achieved	independence	in	December
1991,	but	nearly	a	decade	later	it	appeared	that	there	was	more	camel	traffic	on
the	fabled	Silk	Route	than	today.	These	monuments	to	extravagance,	grandiose
ambition	and	unrealized	dreams	were	the	handiwork	of	Turkmen	President
Saparmurad	Niyazov,	who	spends	little	of	his	country's	dwindling	finances	on
the	upkeep	of	his	country's	4.2	million	 people	but	much	on	his	 thriving
personality	cult.	But	these	desert	mirages	also	represent	the	still	unfulfilled
hopes	of	Turkmenistan	becoming,	as	Niyazov	put	it	to	me	as	early	as	December
1991,	‘the	new	Kuwait’.1
      Since	independence	Turkmenistan,	like	other	oil	rich	CARs,	has	waited	in
vain	for	 its	oil	 and	 gas	riches	to	reach	outside	markets.	Landlocked	and
surrounded	by	potentially	jealous	and	hostile	powers	–	Russia,	Iran,	Afghanistan

184
and	Uzbekistan	 –	the	 Central	Asian	 states	have	man-oeuvered	 relentlessly	for
pipelines	to	 be	 built	 that	would	  end	their	 isolation,	 free	 them	 from	 economic
dependence	on	Russia	and	earn	hard	currency	to	refloat	their	economies	after	the
devastation	wrought	by	 the	break-up	of	 the	Soviet	Union.	 For	 70	years	all	their
communication	links	 –	roads,	railways	and	pipelines	–	were	built	 heading	east	to
Russia.	Now	they	wanted	to	 build	links	 with	 the	Arabian	Sea,	the	Indian	Ocean,
the	Mediterranean	and	China.
       The	 energy	resources	of	the	Caspian	Sea	and	Central	Asia,	(which	we	shall
now	call	the	Caspian	region	and	includes	Kazakhstan,	Turkmenistan,	 Azerbaijan
and	Uzbekistan),	 have	been	described	with	  breathless	hyperbole	over	 the	past
few	years.	In	 the	early	1990s	the	USA	 estimated	that	Caspian	oil	 reserves	were
between	100	 to	 150	billion	  barrels	 (bb).	 That	 figure	 was	 highly	 inflated	 and
possible	reserves	are	now	estimated	to	be	less	than	half	that	or	even	as	low	as	50
bb.	The	Caspian	region's	 proven	oil	 reserves	are	between	16	and	32	 bb,	which
compares	to	22	bb	for	the	USA	 and	17	bb	for	 the	North	 Sea,	giving	the	Caspian
10-15	times	less	than	the	total	reserves	of	the	Middle	East.
       Nevertheless,	 the	 Caspian	 represented	possibly	 the	 last	 unexplored	 and
unexploited	oil-bearing	  region	in	 the	world	  and	its	opening-up	 generated	huge
excitement	amongst	 international	 oil	 companies.	 Western	 oil	 companies	have
shifted	their	 interest	first	 to	 Western	Siberia	in	 1991-92,	then	 to	Kazakhstan	in
1993-94,	Azerbaijan	 in	1995-97	 and	finally	 Turkmenistan	 in	1997-99.	 Between
1994-98,	24	companies	from	13	countries	signed	contracts	in	the	Caspian	region.
Kazakhstan	has	the	largest	oil	reserves	with	 an	estimated	85	bb,	but	 only	10-16
bb	proven	reserves.	Azerbaijan	has	possible	oil	 reserves	of	27	bb	and	only	 4-11
bb	proven	reserves	while	Turkmenistan	has	32	bb	possible	oil	 reserves,	but	only
1.5	bb	proven	reserves.	Uzbekistan's	possible	oil	reserves	are	estimated	at	1	bb.
       Proven	 gas	reserves	in	the	Caspian	region	are	estimated	at	236-337	trillion
cubic	feet	(tcf),	 compared	to	 reserves	of	300	tcf	 in	 the	USA.	 Turkmenistan	 has
the	11th	largest	gas	reserves	in	the	world	 with	 159	 tcf	of	 possible	gas	reserves,
Uzbekistan	110	tcf,	Kazakhstan	88	tcf,	while	 Azerbaijan	and	Uzbekistan	have	35
tcf	each.2
       Central	 Asian	 leaders	became	obsessed	with	projected	pipelines,	 potential
routes	and	the	 geo-politics	 that	 surrounded	them.	 In	 1996	the	 Caspian	region
produced	one	million	 barrels	per	day	(b/d)	of	 oil	 of	which	 only	300,000	 b/d	was
exported	–	mainly	 from	 Kazakhstan.	However	 only	 half	that	 (140,000	b/d)	was
exported	outside	the	former	 Soviet	 Union.	 Caspian	production	 still	 represented
only	 about	4	 per	 cent	of	 total	 world	  oil	 production.	 The	 region's	 natural	 gas

185
production	 in	 1996	totalled	 3.3	 tcf,	 but	only	  0.8	tcf	 was	 exported	outside	 the
former	Soviet	 Union	–	 mostly	from	 Turkmenistan.	 There	was	an	urgent,	almost
desperate	need	for	pipelines.
       The	 scramble	for	 oil	 and	 influence	 by	the	 big	 powers	in	 the	Caspian	 has
been	likened	to	the	Middle	 East	in	 the	1920s.	But	Central	Asia	 today	is	an	even
larger	complex	 quagmire	 of	 competing	 interests.	 Big	 powers	 such	as	Russia,
China	and	the	USA;	 the	neighbours	Iran,	Pakistan,	Afghanistan	 and	Turkey;	 the
Central	Asian	 states	themselves	and	 the	most	 powerful	  players	of	 all,	 the	 oil
companies,	compete	in	what	 I	 called	in	 a	1997	 seminal	magazine	article,	 ‘The
New	Great	Game’.	The	name	seemed	to	stick	and	was	taken	up	by	governments,
experts	and	the	oil	companies.3
       I	 had	 first	 visited	 Central	 Asia	 in	 1989	 during	 President	Mikhail	  Gorba-
chov's	 perestroika	 reform	  programme.	  Convinced	  that	 the	  ethnic	 issue	 in
Afghanistan	 was	 going	 to	 become	 explosive	 after	 the	 withdrawal	  of	  Soviet
troops,	 I	  wanted	 to	 understand	 the	  ethnic	 origins	  of	  the	 Afghan	  Uzbeks,
Turkmens	and	Tajiks	 and	see	their	original	  homelands.	I	returned	to	 the	region
frequently,	 exploring	 the	 vast	 vistas	and	 the	 ethnic	 and	political	  soup	 in	 the
region	that	became	more	complex	and	volatile	 as	the	Soviet	Union	fell	 apart.	By
chance	I	 was	in	 Ashkhabad	 where	 the	 Central	Asian	  leaders	gathered	on	 12
December	1991,	to	 discuss	the	 dismemberment	of	 the	 Soviet	Union	  and	their
independence.
       They	 were	 all	reluctant	 nationalists,	 full	 of	 fear	at	 the	prospects	of	 losing
the	security	and	 support	of	 the	Soviet	 state	system	and	the	prospects	of	 facing
the	outside	  world	 on	 their	  own.	 Within	  a	 few	  months,	 as	 their	 economies
crumbled,	 the	 importance	 of	  their	 oil	  resources	and	 the	 need	 for	 pipelines
became	evident.	They	 began	to	hold	 talks	 with	 Western	oil	 companies,	on	 the
back	 of	  ongoing	  negotiations	  between	 Kazakhstan	  and	 the	 US	  company
Chevron.	My	  subsequent	visits	 resulted	 in	 a	 book	 on	 Central	 Asia	 but	 with
Afghanistan	 disintegrating	  into	 civil	  war,	  I	 concluded	 that	 its	 repercussions
would	rebound	 on	Central	 Asia	and	the	 issue	of	pipelines	 would	 determine	the
future	geo-politics	of	 the	region.4
       The	 label	  –	the	 new	 Great	 Game	 –	 resonated	with	  history.	 In	 the	 late
nineteenth	century	the	 British	 in	 India	 and	tsarist	Russia	 fought	an	 undeclared
war	 of	 competition	 and	 influence	 to	 contain	 each	other	 in	  Central	 Asia	 and
Afghanistan.	 ‘Turkestan,	  Afghanistan,	  Transcaspia,	 Persia	–	  to	 many	 these
words	 breathe	 only	  a	 sense	of	  utter	 remoteness,	 or	 a	 memory	  of	 strange
vicissitudes	and	 of	 moribund	 romance.	To	 me,	I	 confess	they	 are	pieces	on	 a

186
chessboard	upon	which	 is	 being	played	 out	a	 game	for	 the	 domination	 of	 the
world,’	 wrote	 Lord	 Curzon,	 before	 he	became	the	 Viceroy	 of	 India	 in	 1898.5
These	 were	  expanding	   empires	  -the	  British	   pushing	  across	  India	  into
Afghanistan	and	the	Tsar's	armies	conquering	Central	Asia.
       The	 centre	of	gravity	 for	 both	powers	 was	Afghanistan.	The	 British	 feared
that	a	Russian	thrust	 on	Herat	 from	 the	Turkmen	 region	could	 threaten	British
Baluchistan,	while	 Moscow	  gold	could	 turn	 Kabul's	 rulers	 against	the	British.
The	Russians	feared	that	the	British	  would	undermine	 them	in	 Central	Asia	 by
supporting	revolts	 by	the	Muslim	  tribes	and	the	rulers	 of	Bukhara	 and	Kokand.
As	it	  is	today,	 the	 real	battle	 was	over	 communication	 links	  as	both	 empires
indulged	 in	 massive	railway	 projects.	 The	 Russians	built	 railway	  lines	across
Central	 Asia	 to	 their	 borders	 with	 Afghanistan,	  Persia	and	 China,	 while	 the
British	built	 railway	 lines	across	India	to	their	border	with	 Afghanistan.
       Today's	Great	Game	is	also	between	expanding	and	contracting	empires.	As
a	weakened	and	bankrupt	Russia	attempts	to	keep	a	grip	on	what	it	still	 views	as
its	frontiers	in	 Central	Asia	and	control	 the	flow	of	 Caspian	oil	through	pipelines
that	traverse	Russia,	the	 USA	 is	thrusting	 itself	 into	 the	region	 on	the	 back	of
proposed	oil	pipelines	which	would	 bypass	Russia.	Iran,	Turkey	and	Pakistan	are
building	 their	 own	 communication	  links	 with	  the	 region	 and	want	 to	 be	 the
preferred	route	of	 choice	for	future	 pipelines	heading	east,	west	or	 south.	China
wants	to	 secure	stability	 for	 its	restive	 Xinjiang	  region	populated	 by	the	 same
Muslim	 ethnic	groups	 that	inhabit	 Central	Asia,	 secure	the	necessary	energy	to
fuel	 its	rapid	 economic	 growth	 and	expand	 its	 political	 influence	 in	 a	 critical
border	region.	The	Central	Asian	 states	have	their	own	rivalries,	preferences	and
strategic	imperatives.	  Looming	 above	 this	 is	 the	 fierce	 competition	  between
American,	European	and	Asian	oil	companies.
       But	 as	in	the	nineteenth	century,	Afghanistan's	instability	 and	the	advancing
Taliban	were	 creating	 a	new	 dimension	to	 this	 global	 rivalry	 and	 becoming	a
significant	fulcrum	 for	 the	new	Great	Game.	The	states	and	the	companies	had	to
decide	whether	to	 confront	 or	woo	 the	Taliban	 and	whether	the	 Taliban	would
impede	or	help	pipelines	from	Central	Asia	 to	new	markets	in	South	Asia.
       Afghanistan	  had	held	 Central	 Asia	 in	 a	tight	 embrace	for	  centuries.	The
territory	 comprising	 modern	 day	Tajikistan,	  southern	Uzbekistan	 and	northern
Afghanistan	was	 one	contiguous	 territory	 for	 centuries,	ruled	 intermittently	  by
amirs	or	kings	in	 Bukhara	or	 Kabul.	The	Amir	  of	Bukhara	depended	on	Afghan
mercenaries	for	his	 army.	 Persecuted	tribal	chiefs,	 bandits	and	 mullahs	sought
sanctuary	 in	 each	 other's	 territories,	  crossing	 a	  non-existent	 border.	 (Thus

187
Tajikistan's	 decision	  in	 1997	  to	 hand	 over	 the	  Kuliab	  airbase	in	  southern
Tajikistan	to	Ahmad	 Shah	Masud	so	he	could	receive	military	 supplies	from	Iran
and	 Russia,	 was	 but	 a	 continuation	  of	  these	 past	 linkages.)	 Afghanistan's
contiguity	 with	 Central	Asia	came	to	 an	end	after	the	1917	Russian	Revolution,
when	the	Soviet	 Union	sealed	its	 borders	with	 its	southern	Muslim	  neighbours.
The	reopening	 of	 these	borders	 in	 1991	 heralded	the	 start	 of	 the	 new	 Great
Game.
       Afghanistan	  today	 borders	Turkmenistan,	 Tajikistan,	  and	Uzbekistan	 but
only	 Turkmenistan	  has	large	 energy	 resources.	 Along	  the	 Pamir	 mountains
Tajikistan's	  five	   million	    people	  share	  a	  rugged	  640-mile	   border	  with
Afghanistan,	  which	  is	  divided	   by	  the	  Amu	  Darya	  river.	   A	  quarter	  of
Afghanistan's	population	is	Tajik.	 More	 Tajiks	are	scattered	throughout	the	other
CARs	and	 another	200,000	live	  in	China's	 Xinjiang	 province.	 The	 only	 major
ethnic	 group	 in	 Central	 Asia	  which	 is	 not	  of	 Turkic	  origin,	  the	 Tajiks	 are
descended	from	the	first	Persian	tribes	who	inhabited	Central	Asia	between	1500
and	1000	 BC,	 but	were	 later	 pushed	to	 the	peripheries	 by	 a	series	 of	 Turkic
invasions	from	Mongolia.
       In	 ancient	 times,	 Tajikistan	 was	 the	military	  and	economic	 centre	 of	 the
region.	It	acted	as	a	gateway	for	the	Silk	Route	and	for	Turkic	 invaders	who	rode
west	into	Iran,	 Russia	and	Europe	and	south	into	 Afghanistan	and	India.	 Russia
annexed	the	northern	part	of	present	day	Tajikistan	 in	1868	and	it	 became	a	part
of	the	province	 of	 Russia-controlled	Turkestan.	 As	the	 Great	Game	intensified,
the	British	and	Russians	demarcated	the	border	between	Afghanistan	and	Central
Asia	in	1884,	when	Russia	annexed	southern	Tajikistan.
       After	  Stalin	created	the	five	 CARs	 in	1924–25	by	 arbitrarily	 drawing	 lines
on	a	map,	 he	handed	over	 Bukhara	 and	Samarkand,	the	 two	 major	centres	 of
Tajik	 culture	  and	history	  to	 Uzbekistan,	 creating	 a	 rivalry	  between	the	 two
Republics	which	  has	simmered	 ever	 since.	Modern	 day	 Tajikistan	  represents
none	of	the	population	 or	 economic	centres	of	ancient	 Tajik	 glories.	Stalin	 also
created	the	Autonomous	Region	 of	Gorno-Badakhshan	in	 the	Pamir	mountains,
which	contains	44	 per	cent	of	 the	land	area	of	 Tajikistan	 but	only	 3	per	cent	of
the	 population.	  While	   the	 Tajiks	   are	 Sunni	  Muslims,	  Gorno-Badakhshan
contains	various	Pamiri	 ethnic	 groups	many	 of	 whom	are	Shia	 Muslims.	 They
include	 the	Ismaelis,	 a	 Shia	sect	 and	followers	  of	 the	 Agha	 Khan,	 who	 also
inhabit	the	contiguous	Badakhshan	region	of	Afghanistan.
       A	 few	 months	 after	the	 1917	Revolution,	 Muslim	  guerrilla	 groups	sprang
up	 across	Central	  Asia	 to	  resist	 the	 Bolsheviks.	  These	 rebels	 were	 called

188
Basmachis	by	the	Bolsheviks,	a	derogative	term	meaning	bandit.	 The	movement
stood	for	 Islam,	 nationalism	 and	 anti-communism.	 Sixty	 years	 later	the	 same
inspiration	motivated	 the	Mujaheddin	 in	Afghanistan.	 Determined	 to	undermine
Soviet	power,	the	British	 helped	the	Basmachis	in	1919,	by	paying	Kabul's	rulers
to	send	camel	caravans	of	arms	and	ammunition	to	the	Basmachis.	Thousands	of
Tajik	Basmachis	took	 refuge	in	northern	Afghanistan	 as	their	struggle	continued
until	1929,	 when	they	were	finally	  crushed	by	the	Bolsheviks.	 In	another	replay
in	the	1980s,	the	USA	 encouraged	the	Afghan	Mujaheddin	 to	cross	into	 Central
Asia	and	 attack	Soviet	 army	 posts.	And	 in	 reply	Soviet	 troops	 in	 Afghanistan
frequently	called	the	Mujaheddin	 ‘Basmachis’.
       Tajikistan	  remained	an	 underdeveloped,	poverty-stricken	 Republic	 on	 the
Soviet	Union's	periphery.	 Its	budget	depended	on	subsidies	from	Moscow.	 After
1991,	tensions	 between	Uzbeks	 and	Tajiks	  and	intra-clan	 rivalries	  within	 the
Tajiks	 erupted.	The	 resulting	 civil	 war	 (1992-97)	 between	the	 neo-communist
government	and	an	array	of	Islamicist	 forces	devastated	the	country.	Once	again
thousands	of	Tajik	  rebels	and	 refugees	found	 refuge	in	 northern	 Afghanistan,
while	Tajik	  government	forces	were	 backed	by	Russian	troops.	President	Boris
Yeltsin	 declared	in	 1993	 that	the	 Tajik-Afghan	  border	 was	‘in	 effect	 Russia's
border’	 and	 the	 25,000	 Russian	 troops	 stationed	 there	 would	  be	 defending
Russia.6	It	was	a	reassertion	of	Moscow's	role	in	Central	Asia.
       Ultimately	  the	neo-communist	government	 and	the	Islamicist	 opposition	in
Tajikistan	 agreed	to	a	UN-brokered	 peace	settlement,	but	neither	side	had	 been
able	to	promote	a	national	identity	 for	the	fragmented	Tajik	 clans.	These	internal
cleavages	and	the	fact	that	it	 ‘lacked	 an	indigenous	 intelligentsia	 to	elaborate	a
nationalism	 linking	  the	 people	to	  the	land	 and	 each	 other’,	 left	 the	 country
vulnerable	 to	  influences	  from	  Afghanistan.7	  Both	  sides	 in	  the	  civil	  war
eventually	co-operated	 with	 Masud,	 who	to	 many	 Tajiks	 became	a	symbol	 of
Tajik	nationalism	 as	he	battled	the	Taliban.	The	Taliban	added	to	Masud's	image
by	accusing	him	of	trying	 to	divide	 Afghanistan	and	create	a	‘Greater	Tajikistan’
by	joining	  Afghanistan's	 Badakhshan	province	 with	  Tajikistan.	 Masud	 denies
such	aims.	For	Tajikistan	 the	Taliban	 represented	an	Islamic	fundamentalism	 at
odds	 with	  the	 moderate,	 Sufi	  spiritualism	   of	 Central	  Asia	  while	  Pashtun
expansionism	was	at	direct	odds	with	Tajik	 aspirations.
       In	 Uzbekistan	Islamic	 militancy,	 partly	 fuelled	 by	Afghanistan,	 is	the	most
serious	challenge	to	President	Islam	Karimov.	The	Uzbeks	–	the	most	numerous,
aggressive	and	influential	 race	in	the	 region	–	occupy	 today's	Islamic	 heartland
and	the	political	  nerve	centre	of	 Central	 Asia.	Uzbekistan	 has	borders	with	 all

189
the	CARs	and	Afghanistan.	 Its	 principal	 cities	of	 Samarkand	and	Bukhara	have
played	host	to	 countless	civilizations	  over	2,500	 years	and	became	the	 second
centre	 for	 Islamic	  learning	  after	 Arabia.	  Medieval	  Bukhara	  contained	 360
mosques	and	 113	 madrassas	and	 even	 in	 1900	 there	 were	 10,000	 students
studying	at	100	 active	madrassas.	The	 250-mile	 long	Ferghana	valley,	 with	 its
long	associations	with	 Islamic	 learning	and	militancy	 such	as	the	Basmachis,	is
the	 richest	 agricultural	   region	  in	 Central	  Asia	  and	 the	  centre	 of	  Islamic
opposition	to	Karimov.
       The	 Uzbeks	trace	their	 genealogy	to	Genghis	Khan's	 Mongols,	one	branch
of	which,	  the	Shaybani	 clan,	conquered	 modern-day	Uzbekistan	 and	 northern
Afghanistan	in	1500.	 Mahmud	Ibn	Wali,	 a	sixteenth-century	 historian,	described
the	 early	 Uzbeks	  as	 ‘famed	 for	  their	  bad	 nature,	 swiftness,	  audacity	 and
boldness’	and	revelling	 in	their	 outlaw	 image.8	Little	 has	changed	in	the	Uzbek
desire	for	power	and	influence	 since	then.	Uzbekistan	is	 the	largest	CAR	 with	a
population	of	 22	million.	  And	with	 some	six	 million	 Uzbeks	 living	 in	 the	other
CARs	  –	   forming	   substantial	  minorities	    in	  three	   of	  them	   (Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan	and	Kazakhstan)	–	Karimov	 has	ethnic	allies	to	 pursue	his	agenda
of	  dominating	   the	  region.	  Some	  two	  million	   Uzbeks	  live	   in	   northern
Afghanistan,	the	result	 of	migrations	 before	and	during	 the	Basmachi	rebellion.
Another	25,000	Uzbeks	live	in	 China's	Xinjiang	 province.
       Well	   before	 Soviet	  troops	  withdrew	  from	  Afghanistan,	  Moscow	  and
Tashkent	were	cultivating	  Afghan	Uzbeks	 to	create	a	secular	 Uzbek-controlled
‘cordon	 sanitaire’	 in	 northern	 Afghanistan	  that	 would	 resist	 any	 Mujaheddin
takeover.	 For	 nearly	  a	 decade	that	  policy	  was	 successful.	 General	 Rashid
Dostum	 controlled	  six	 provinces	  and	 with	  military	  aid	  from	  Moscow	  and
Tashkent,	held	 off	 the	Mujaheddin	 and	 later	the	 Taliban.	 Karimov	 meanwhile
led	the	attempt	to	 forge	an	 anti-Taliban	 alliance	amongst	the	CARs	 and	Russia
after	1994.	However,	with	 the	fall	 of	Mazar	 in	1998,	Karimov's	 policy	 collapsed
and	 the	 Taliban	 were	  now	 Uzbekistan's	 immediate	  neighbours.	 Since	 then
Uzbekistan's	influence	 in	Afghanistan	 has	waned	considerably	 as	Karimov	 was
unwilling	 to	back	Masud,	a	Tajik.
       Karimov	  has	 also	tried	 unsuccessfully	 at	 throwing	 his	 weight	 around	 in
Tajikistan,	where	24	 per	cent	of	the	population	 is	Uzbek.	In	 1992	Karimov	 gave
military	 support	to	the	Tajik	 government	 in	its	 crackdown	on	Islamic	 rebels.	By
1996	 when	 peace	talks	  were	 under	 way	 between	 the	 antagonists,	 Karimov
attempted	to	 force	both	 sides	to	 give	 a	greater	role	 to	 the	Uzbek	 minority	  by
supporting	 local	  Uzbek	  uprisings	 in	  northern	 Tajikistan.	   Karimov	  remains

190
opposed	to	 the	Tajik	  attempt	to	 make	 a	coalition	  administration	 between	 the
government	and	the	rebels,	because	it	would	show	the	Islamicists	in	a	good	light
–	a	lesson	that	would	percolate	down	to	Uzbekistan's	own	frustrated	population.
       Karimov	  runs	a	 tightly	 controlled,	  authoritarian	 police	state	 and	cites	the
civil	 wars	in	 Afghanistan	 and	Tajikistan	 as	justification	 for	 repression	at	home.
The	most	significant	 opposition	to	 Karimov	 has	come	from	underground	radical
Islamic	 groups,	 some	of	 them	 Wahabbis,	 entrenched	in	 the	 Ferghana	valley.
Many	of	 these	Uzbek	militants	 studied	secretly	in	 Saudi	Arabia	 and	Pakistan	or
trained	in	Afghan	 Mujaheddin	camps	in	the	1980s.	Subsequently	they	developed
links	with	 the	Taliban.
       Karimov	 has	passed	the	most	stringent	laws	of	all	the	CARs	 against	Islamic
fundamentalism,	from	  restricting	 madrassa	education	 to	 the	growth	 of	 beards
and	has	 blamed	 all	  unrest	 on	 the	 Wahabbis,	 a	 blanket	 term	  which	 Uzbek
authorities	increasingly	  use	to	 describe	all	 Islamic	 activism.	  But	 with	 half	 of
Uzbekistan's	population	 under	18	 years	of	 age	and	 widespread	unemployment
and	inflation,	 unrest	amongst	Uzbek	youth	is	 growing.	The	 social	and	economic
dissatisfaction	 amongst	 young	 people	 is	 unrecognized	 by	  the	 regime.	 Even
though	Uzbekistan	may	 be	the	most	powerful	 state	in	 Central	Asia,	 it	 faces	the
most	intense	 political	  and	religious	 polarization.	  Karimov's	 failed	  forays	 into
Afghanistan	and	Tajikistan	have	only	 encouraged	Islamic	militancy.
       Nevertheless,	 Uzbekistan	 is	 a	 major	 player	 in	  the	 new	 Great	 Game.	It
produces	sufficient	 oil	 and	gas	for	 domestic	 consumption	 and	will	  soon	be	an
exporter.	Initially	  Uzbekistan	was	ignored	 by	the	oil	 companies	who	 scrambled
to	sign	 contracts	 with	 Tashkent's	 neighbours.	 Karimov	 was	 both	 jealous	 and
envious	of	 their	success	in	attracting	 foreign	 investment,	 even	as	he	refused	to
loosen	state	controls	on	the	 economy	to	attract	 Western	investors.	As	 Tashkent
becomes	an	energy	exporter	it	 will	 have	a	vested	interest	 in	trying	 to	 influence
routes	for	pipelines	that	benefit	 Uzbekistan,	but	it	 will	 also	act	as	a	spoiler	in	 its
determination	not	to	see	its	neighbours	prosper	and	thus	become	more	influential
in	the	region.
       Afghanistan's	 500,000	 Turkmen	 population	 also	arrived	 as	a	result	 of	 the
1920s	civil	war	 in	the	Soviet	Union.	 The	first	 migration	into	 Afghanistan	was	by
the	Esari	tribe	in	 the	early	nineteenth	century,	 who	were	 followed	 by	the	Tekke
tribe	after	 their	revolt	 against	the	Bolsheviks	 failed.	 Turkmenistan	 is	a	desolate
land	of	 desert	 and	mountains	 inhabited	 by	the	 nomadic	 Turkmen	 tribes,	 who
fiercely	resisted	but	eventually	succumbed	to	Persian,	Turkic	 and	finally	 Russian
conquerers.	Before	 the	 nineteenth	century,	 borders	 were	 meaningless	for	  the

191
Turkmen	 who	migrated	 freely	 across	the	 region.	Some	 300,000	Turkmen	 still
live	in	Iran,	 170,000	in	Iraq,	80,000	in	Syria	and	several	thousand	in	Turkey.
       The	 Tekke,	the	largest	Turkmen	tribe,	began	to	resist	Russian	advances	into
their	territory	  in	1870	 and	wiped	 out	a	Russian	army	 at	the	 oasis	fort	 of	Geok
Tepe	in	 1881.	Six	 thousand	 Turkmen	 horsemen	were	killed	  a	year	 later	 by	a
Russian	retaliatory	force.	In	 1916	the	Turkmen	 under	the	charismatic	leadership
of	Mohammed	 Qurban	Junaid	 Khan	 began	another	long	 and	bloody	 resistance
against	first	 tsarist	Russian	 and	then	the	 Bolsheviks	 which	 continued	 until	 his
defeat	in	1927,	when	he	took	refuge	in	Afghanistan.
       Throughout	  the	 Soviet	 era	Turkmenistan	  was	ignored	 by	  Moscow.	 The
Republic	had	 the	highest	 unemployment	 rate,	the	highest	 infant	 mortality	  rate
and	lowest	 industrialization	 of	 any	Soviet	 Republic	 apart	from	 Tajikistan.9	 As
Moscow	invested	in	 the	oil	and	gas	industry	 in	Siberia,	Turkmenistan's	potential
oil	reserves	were	ignored.	Nevertheless	47	per	cent	of	Turkmenistan's	revenue	in
1989	came	from	the	sale	of	3.2	 tcf	of	 natural	gas	to	other	Soviet	Republics.	 The
breakup	  of	    the	  Soviet	   Union	    turned	   Turkmenistan's	   customers	  into
impoverished,	independent	 states	who	 could	 not	pay	 their	 bills.	 ‘We	  have	no
idea	now	who	 will	 buy	 our	gas	and	how	 they	will	  pay	for	 it,’	 Foreign	 Minister
Avde	Kuliyev	 told	 me	in	December	1991.10
       Turkmenistan's	 dilemma	 was	 that	it	 was	 sandwiched	between	Iran	 which
was	unacceptable	to	the	USA	as	a	pipeline	route;	Afghanistan	which	was	trapped
in	civil	 war;	 and	Russia	which	wanted	to	limit	 Turkmenistan's	 gas	exports	to	the
West	because	they	competed	with	Russia's	own	exports	of	Siberian	gas.	By	1992
Ukraine,	Armenia	 and	then	 even	Russia	refused	to	 pay	their	 bills	 for	 Turkmen
gas	imports.	  Moscow	 had	 a	 stranglehold	  as	all	  Turkmen	 gas	 was	 pumped
through	the	vast	former	Soviet	 pipeline	network	 that	was	now	owned	by	 Russia.
President	Niyazov	shut	down	 gas	supplies	to	his	neighbours	 after	Turkmenistan
accumulated	over	 US$1	 billion	  in	 unpaid	 bills	  and	 Turkmen	 gas	production
slipped	to	0.73	tcf	in	1994,	less	than	a	quarter	of	what	it	was	five	 years	earlier.
       Although	  the	USA	 was	determined	to	isolate	Iran,	 Turkmenistan	could	 not
afford	to	do	so,	as	Iran	offered	the	nearest	and	most	accessible	outlet	to	the	south
and	the	sea.	Adroitly	  Niyazov	 wooed	 the	USA	 while	 seeking	Tehran's	help	 in
developing	 road	 and	 rail	  links.	  In	  December	 1997	 the	 Iranians	 completed
construction	of	a	119-mile-long	 gas	pipeline	 between	the	Korpedzhe	gas	field	in
Western	Turkmenistan	to	 Kord-Kuy	 in	 northeastern	Iran.	The	Turkmen	 gas	that
flows	 through	it	 is	 consumed	in	 northern	Iran.11	This	 pipeline	 is	still	  the	only
new	pipeline	 built	  between	Central	 Asia	 and	the	 outside	world	  after	nearly	 a

192
decade	of	trying.
       Niyazov	  also	 courted	Western	 oil	  companies	to	 build	 gas	 pipelines	 that
would	free	him	 from	the	Russian	pipeline	 network.	In	 April	 1992	Turkmenistan,
Turkey	and	Iran	agreed	to	build	a	gas	pipeline	to	Turkey	 and	on	to	Europe	which
would	cost	 US$2.5	billion.	  That	pipeline	 never	got	 built	 and	subsequently	saw
several	variations	 as	the	US	 tried	 to	 block	 any	route	 through	 Iran.	Finally,	  in
February	1999,	 Turkmenistan	 signed	 another	agreement,	this	 time	 with	 a	 US
consortium,	to	build	 a	Turkmenistan–Turkey	 gas	pipeline	which	would	 go	under
the	Caspian	Sea	to	Azerbaijan	and	avoid	Iran.12
       As	 Niyazov	 saw	his	economy	 crumble	he	sought	 alternative	export	 routes.
On	the	 drawing	 boards	in	 1994	 were	plans	 for	 a	5,000-mile-long	  oil	 and	 gas
pipeline	eastwards	to	China	 that	would	 cost	over	US$20	 billion,	 but	the	 project
is	still	 only	 in	 the	 feasibility	 stage.13	Also	in	 1994	Bridas,	 the	Argentinian	  oil
company	 which	 had	 concessions	 in	 Turkmenistan,	 proposed	 building	  a	 gas
pipeline	that	would	 cross	Afghanistan	and	deliver	gas	to	Pakistan	and	India.	The
US	company	Unocal	 with	support	 from	Washington	 proposed	a	similar	pipeline
in	1995.	 The	battle	between	the	 two	companies	to	 build	 this	pipeline,	 which	 is
explored	in	 the	next	 two	chapters,	sucked	in	 the	Taliban	 and	the	 other	Afghan
warlords.	Thus	 Afghanistan	 became	the	 fulcrum	 of	 the	first	  battle	of	 the	 new
Great	Game.
       Weak	  and	impoverished	  and	 with	 no	 military	   force	 to	 defend	 its	 long
borders	with	Iran,	 Afghanistan	 and	its	rival	 Uzbekistan,	Turkmenistan	 opted	for
a	foreign	 policy	 of	neutrality.	 This	 gave	the	Turkmens	 the	justification	  to	keep
their	 distance	 from	  Russia	and	 avoid	  being	 sucked	 into	 the	 economic	  and
military	 pacts	that	arose	out	of	the	break	up	of	 the	Soviet	Union.	 Neutrality	 also
allowed	Ashkhabad	to	 avoid	taking	 sides	in	the	Afghan	 conflict,	 which	 angered
Moscow	and	Tashkent	as	Turkmenistan	refused	to	join	 the	anti-Taliban	 alliance.
Ashkhabad	had	provided	the	 communist	regime	 in	Afghanistan	 with	 diesel	fuel
until	 Kabul	 fell	  in	 1992.	 It	 proceeded	to	 do	 the	 same	for	 Ismael	 Khan	 who
controlled	Herat	 until	1995	 and	later	the	Taliban.	While	 the	Turkmen	 Consulate
in	Herat	maintained	 good	relations	with	 the	Taliban,	 its	Consulate	in	 Mazar	did
the	same	with	 the	 anti-Taliban	 alliance.	 Turkmenistan	was	 the	only	 CAR	 that
wooed	the	Taliban	rather	than	confronted	them.
       Like	 his	 Central	Asian	counterparts,	Niyazov	 was	a	severe	autocratic	ruler,
allowing	  no	 political	  opposition,	 censoring	 the	 media	 and	 maintaining	  state
control	over	the	 economy.	He	developed	a	crude	personality	cult	 in	 the	Stalinist
mode,	 with	   his	  portraits	  and	  statues	 on	  display	  everywhere.	  An	  entire

193
government	 department	 was	 set	 up	 to	 disseminate	 the	 President's	 pictures.
Niyazov,	 like	  his	 rival	  Karimov,	  was	 an	 orphan.	 Both	  were	 bought	 up	  in
communist	orphanages	and	joined	their	respective	Communist	Parties	at	an	early
age,	rising	  to	  become	 Secretary	 General	 well	   before	 independence.	 Their
education,	upbringing	 and	loyalties	 lay	with	 the	 defunct	communist	 system	but
they	both	learned	to	play	the	new	Great	Game	with	skill.
       No	 country	in	the	region	 has	benefited	more	from	the	break	up	of	the	Soviet
Union	than	 Turkey.	Russia	has	been	Turkey's	 most	potent	enemy	for	 centuries.
From	the	late	seventeenth	century	to	World	 War	One,	Turkey	 and	Russia	fought
over	a	dozen	wars	and	this	 rivalry	 had	prompted	 Turkey	to	 join	 NATO	 and	try
and	become	a	 member	 of	 the	 EU.	 However,	 the	 independence	of	 the	CARs
suddenly	awakened	Turkey	to	its	much	older	historical	 legacy.
       Until	  1991	Pan-Turkism	 –	 the	idea	of	 a	Turkic	  homeland	stretching	 from
the	Mediterranean	to	China	 –	was	a	romantic	dream	espoused	by	a	few	 Turkish
scholars	and	barely	 figured	 in	 Turkey's	foreign	 policy	  agenda.	Suddenly,	after
1991,	Pan-Turkism	became	an	achievable	reality	and	an	integral	part	of	Turkey's
foreign	 policy.	 Turkish	  dialects	 were	 now	 spoken	by	 an	 accessible	and	 vast
contiguous	belt	 that	 stretched	from	  Istanbul	 across	the	 Caucasus	and	Central
Asia	to	Xinjiang	 in	 China.	The	CARs	 saw	Turkey	as	a	model	for	their	 economic
development	 –	 Muslim	   but	 secular	 –	 while	  Turkey	  desired	 to	  expand	 its
influence	in	the	region	and	become	a	major	player	on	the	world	stage.
       Turkey	 began	to	send	massive	aid	to	the	CARs	 and	the	Caucasus	–	starting
direct	flights	  to	 their	 capitals,	beaming	 TV	 programmes	 via	 satellite,	offering
thousands	of	 scholarships	 to	 students,	 training	  their	 diplomats,	 soldiers	 and
bankers	and	initiating	  an	annual	 Pan-Turkic	 summit.	 Between	1992	 and	1998
Turkish	 companies	invested	more	than	 US$1.5	billion	  in	 the	region,	 becoming
the	single	 largest	 state	 investor.	 Turkey	 also	 realised	 that	 to	 be	effective	  in
Central	Asia	 it	 had	to	 placate	Russia	which	 it	 did	 by	 buying	 Russian	gas	and
expanding	trade	with	Russia,	which	 rose	from	US$1.9	billion	  in	1990	to	US$4.1
billion	 in	 1997.14	In	1997,	 the	EU's	rejection	 of	 Turkey's	 membership	angered
the	Turks,	but	 also	pushed	them	into	 forging	 closer	 ties	with	 the	USA,	 Russia,
Israel	and	Central	Asia.
       Turkey	  has	become	a	major	 player	 in	 the	 new	Great	 Game.	Its	 need	for
energy	 and	  desire	 to	  expand	  its	  influence	  prompted	  successive	 Turkish
governments	to	push	for	 becoming	the	principal	 route	 for	Central	 Asian	energy
exports.	In	the	summer	of	 1997	the	USA	 and	Turkey	 jointly	 sponsored	the	idea
of	a	 ‘transportation	 corridor’	  for	 a	main	 oil	 pipeline	 from	 Baku	 in	 Azerbaijan

194
through	  Georgia	   and	  the	  Caucasus	  to	  Turkey's	   Ceyhan	  port	   on	  the
Mediterranean.	Kazakhstan	and	Turkmenistan	would	be	encouraged	to	feed	their
oil	 into	 this	  pipeline.	 This,	 the	 USA	 argued,	 would	  give	 the	 expensive	and
lengthy	 Baku–Ceyhan	 route	 the	 necessary	oil	  volumes	 to	 make	 the	 project
financially	  viable.15	The	 USA	  wanted	Turkmenistan	  to	 build	 a	 gas	 pipeline
under	the	Caspian	Sea	which	would	then	run	along	the	Baku–Ceyhan	corridor	 to
Europe.
       The	 USA	also	urged	Kazakhstan	to	commit	 to	building	 a	similar	 under-the-
sea	Caspian	oil	pipeline,	 so	that	 Kazakh	oil	 could	 be	pumped	along	 the	Baku–
Ceyhan	corridor.	 Kazakhstan's	 vast	oil	  reserves	were	being	 exploited	 by	 two
major	Western	 oil	 consortiums	in	 Tenghiz	 and	Karachagnak,	while	 China	 was
developing	 a	third	 oil-bearing	  region	around	 Uzen.16	Kazakhstan	already	 had
one	planned	oil	pipeline	route	from	 Tenghiz	to	 the	Russian	port	of	Novorossiysk
on	the	Black	Sea,	which	was	being	developed	by	Chevron,	but	the	Baku–Ceyhan
route	would	offer	 an	alternative	that	avoided	Russia.
       The	  Azerbaijan	 International	  Operating	 Company	 (AIOC),	   made	up	 of
nearly	a	dozen	of	 the	world's	 oil	 companies	and	which	 dominated	 Azerbaijan's
oil	 development,	 was	 averse	to	  the	 Baku–Ceyhan	 route	 because	it	 was	 too
expensive,	too	long	and	would	cross	Turkey's	volatile	 Kurdish	region.17	By	1998
it	was	 clear	that	 US	plans	 to	develop	 the	Afghanistan	 route	 would	 be	delayed
and	so	the	Baku–Ceyhan	corridor	became	the	main	plank	of	Washington's	policy
towards	the	Caspian	region.
       The	 controversy	over	 Baku–Ceyhan	raged	on	for	 two	years	until	 late	1998
when	international	oil	 prices	crashed	because	of	the	slump	in	demand	due	to	the
Asian	 economic	 crisis.	 Oil	  prices	 sunk	 to	 a	 record	 low	  of	 US$13	 a	 barrel
compared	to	 US$25	in	 1997,	 making	 it	 uneconomical	 to	 immediately	 exploit
Central	 Asian	 oil,	 which	  was	 both	 expensive	to	 produce	 and	 transport.	 The
break-even	price	 for	 Central	 Asian	 oil	  was	around	 US$18	 dollars	 a	barrel.18
Even	 though	  the	 Baku-Ceyhan	 route	  was	 no	  longer	 viable	  commercially,
Washington	continued	to	 pursue	its	construction	as	it	 became	the	main	plank	of
US	policy	in	 Central	Asia.
       Turkey	  had	 backed	 the	 Afghan	 Mujaheddin	  in	  the	 1980s,	 but	 its	 role
remained	 limited.	  However,	  as	 it	  developed	 a	  Pan-Turkic	  foreign	  policy,
Ankhara	began	to	actively	 support	the	Turkic	 minorities	 in	 Afghanistan	 such	as
the	Uzbeks.	Ankhara	 provided	 financial	 support	 to	General	 Dostum	 and	twice
gave	him	a	 home	in	exile.	 Turkey	 became	vehemently	opposed	to	 the	Taliban,
which	 had	 created	new	 tensions	 with	  its	 close	ally	  Pakistan.	 Moreover,	 the

195
Taliban	 threat	 had	also	 pushed	Turkey	  into	 a	 greater	understanding	 with	 its
regional	rival	Iran.
       Turkey	 also	played	 a	role	in	 turning	 around	Israel's	policy	 in	 Afghanistan.
Turkey	and	Israel	 had	developed	close	military	 and	strategic	 ties	after	the	1993
Oslo	Accords.	 The	 Israelis	and	 more	significantly	  some	Jewish	 lobbies	in	 the
USA	 were	 not	 initially	   critical	  of	 the	 Taliban.19	In	  line	 with	  the	 US	 State
Department,	Israel	saw	the	Taliban	as	an	anti-Iranian	 force	which	 could	be	used
to	undermine	Iranian	 influence	 in	Afghanistan	 and	Central	 Asia.	Moreover,	 the
Unocal	pipeline	 across	Afghanistan	would	impede	 Iran	from	 developing	its	own
pipelines	from	Central	Asia.
       Israel's	 intelligence	 agency	Mossad	developed	a	dialogue	 with	 the	Taliban
through	Taliban	liason	offices	 in	the	USA	 and	with	 the	oil	companies.	Pakistan's
ISI	supported	this	 dialogue.	 Even	though	Pakistan	did	 not	 recognize	Israel,	the
ISI	had	developed	links	 through	the	 CIA	 with	 Mossad	during	the	Afghan	 jihad.
With	 initial	  support	 from	 Turkey,	 Israel	 also	developed	 close	 diplomatic	 and
economic	  links	   with	   Turkmenistan,	  Uzbekistan	   and	  Kazakhstan.	  Israeli
companies	invested	in	agriculture,	the	oil	industry	 and	communications.
       But	 as	US	policy	 towards	the	Taliban	 shifted	so	did	 Israel's,	as	the	Taliban
gave	refuge	 to	Bin	  Laden	and	 encouraged	the	drugs	 trade.	Turkey	 convinced
Israel	that	 the	 Taliban	 were	 a	security	 threat	 to	 the	 region	 and	could	 export
Islamic	fundamentalism	 to	 Central	Asia.	 As	the	 Unocal	project	 evaporated	and
Israel	realized	the	aversion	 its	Central	 Asian	allies	 and	Turkey	 had	towards	the
Taliban,	Mossad	opened	contacts	with	 the	anti-Taliban	 alliance.	 Israel	now	 had
an	interest	 in	  seeing	that	 the	 Taliban	 did	  not	 take	 control	 of	  the	 whole	 of
Afghanistan,	 even	 though	  it	 remained	 suspicious	  of	 Ahmad	  Shah	 Masud's
support	from	 Iran.	 Both	the	 Taliban	 and	the	Northern	 Alliance	 were	 to	accuse
each	other	of	receiving	Israeli	support.
       With	  oil	 prices	crashing	 in	 1999,	Iran	 remained	the	wild	  card	in	 the	new
Great	Game.	Iran	 sits	on	 the	second	largest	gas	reserves	in	 the	world	  and	has
over	93	bb	 of	proven	 oil	 reserves	with	current	 oil	 production	at	 3.6	million/bd.
As	pipeline	 projects	 waned	 due	to	 low	 oil	 prices,	 Iran	 stepped	in	to	 urge	 the
CARs	to	 export	their	 oil	 through	 a	direct	 north–	south	pipeline	 to	 the	Gulf	 via
Iran.	This	could	 be	built	at	a	fraction	 of	the	cost	of	 new	pipelines	across	Turkey,
because	Iran	already	had	an	extensive	pipeline	network	 and	only	 needed	to	add
pipeline	 spurs	to	connect	 Iran	 with	 Azerbaijan.	 ‘The	 Iranian	 route	for	  Central
Asian	oil	 is	the	safest,	most	economic	and	easiest.	The	total	 cost	for	Iran	 would
be	US$300,000.	  How	 does	 that	 compare	 with	  US$3	 billion	   for	 a	 pipeline

196
through	Turkey?’	  Ali	  Majedi,	 Iran's	Deputy	 Minister	  of	 Oil	 said	 in	 Tehran.20
Moreover,	Iran	 was	also	in	competition	 with	 Turkmenistan	to	build	 a	gas	export
pipeline	to	 India	and	 Pakistan	–	a	much	more	 attractive	route	 because	it	would
avoid	Afghanistan.21
       In	 the	 first	 phase	of	 its	programme,	 Iran	proposed	 swapping	its	 crude	oil
with	Central	 Asian	crude.	Since	1998	crude	from	 Kazakhstan	and	Turkmenistan
has	been	transported	 across	the	Caspian	 Sea	to	 Iran's	 Caspian	port	 of	 Neka,
where	it	is	refined	and	consumed	in	Iran.	In	 exchange	Iran	allowed	companies	to
lift	  oil	  from	 Iranian	  ports	 on	 the	  Gulf.	  With	  pipeline	 projects	 indefinitely
delayed,	this	appealed	to	the	oil	 companies	who,	 despite	US	pressure	not	to	 do
so,	began	to	negotiate	further	swaps	with	Iran.	Two	 US	companies,	Chevron	and
Mobil	 who	have	oil	 concessions	in	Kazakhstan	and	Turkmenistan	applied	to	 the
Clinton	administration	 in	May	 1998	for	a	license	to	carry	out	swaps	with	 Iran	–	a
move	that	created	a	major	policy	 headache	for	Washington	and	would	become	a
test	case	for	the	future	of	US	sanctions	against	Iran.22
       Ultimately	   the	 security	 needed	to	 build	  pipelines	 from	  Central	 Asia	 to
South	 Asia	 rested	 on	 ending	 the	  Afghan	 civil	   war.	 ‘The	  CARs	 have	 two
problems	with	 Afghanistan.	 One	 is	fear	 and	the	 other	is	 opportunity,’	  the	UN
mediator	for	 Afghanistan	 Lakhdar	 Brahimi	 told	 me.	‘Fear	 is	the	 realization	 by
these	new	and	still	fragile	 countries	that	the	Afghan	conflict	 cannot	be	contained
for	 ever	within	  its	 borders.	Either	  it	 is	 resolved	or	 it	 will	  spill	  over	into	  the
CARs.	They	 want	 to	 avoid	 adventures	of	 any	kind	 from	  Kabul,	 be	it	 Islamic
fundamentalism,	 terrorism	  or	 drugs.	 The	  opportunity	  is	 that	  as	landlocked
countries	who	want	to	 break	their	dependence	on	Russia,	they	are	looking	south
for	oil	 and	gas	pipelines	and	communication	 routes.	They	want	a	government	in
Kabul	 which	 is	responsible	and	 is	a	 good	neighbour.	 They	 want	to	 open	their
borders	not	close	them,’	Brahimi	added.23
       Despite	 declining	  oil	 prices	 and	 Russia's	desperate	economic	 plight,	 the
battle	 of	 wills	  between	 the	 USA	  and	 Russia	 will	  dominate	 future	  pipeline
competition.	 Russia	remains	 adamant	in	  keeping	the	 USA	  out	 of	 its	 Central
Asian	backyard.	‘We	 cannot	 help	seeing	the	uproar	stirred	 up	in	 some	Western
countries	over	the	energy	resources	of	the	Caspian.	Some	seek	to	exclude	Russia
from	 the	game	 and	undermine	 its	 interests.	The	 so-called	pipeline	 war	 in	 the
region	is	part	 of	this	 game,’	said	President	Boris	 Yeltsin	 in	1998.24	By	keeping
the	conflict	 in	Afghanistan	 on	the	boil	 Russia	keeps	the	region	unstable	and	has
the	excuse	to	maintain	a	military	presence	in	the	CARs.

197
       The	 USA	now	 wants	stability,	for	 it	is	concerned	about	the	repercussions	of
the	continuing	  Afghan	 war	 on	 its	own	  policies	 in	 Central	 Asia.	 ‘Throughout
Central	Asia,	leaders	are	on	edge	about	instability	in	 Afghanistan	and	Tajikistan.
They	fear	an	expansion	of	Iranian	 influence	and	the	rise	of	 violent	 extremism	in
their	 countries,’	 said	 Stephen	 Sestanovich,	Special	 Adviser	  to	 the	 US	 State
Department	on	the	 States	of	the	 former	 Soviet	Union	 (FSU)	 in	 March	 1999.25
Only	an	end	to	the	Afghan	civil	  war	would	give	 the	CARs	and	oil	companies	the
confidence	to	 go	ahead	with	 pipeline	 projects	to	 South	Asia	 and	that	 does	not
appear	likely	any	time	soon.

                     ROMANCING	            THE	    TALIBAN	         1:
                                           THE	    BATTLE
                               FOR	   PIPELINES	         1994-96



	
Carlos	Bulgheroni	was	the	Taliban's	first	introduction	to	the	outside	world	of
high	 finance,	oil	  politics	 and	 the	new	 Great	 Game.	An	  Argentinian	and
Chairman	of	 Bridas,	he	 visualized	connecting	his	 company's	gas	fields	 in
Turkmenistan	to	Pakistan	and	India	–	thereby	creating	a	swathe	of	infrastructure
connections	that	could	allow	  peace	to	break	 out	in	  Afghanistan	and	even
between	India	and	Pakistan.
       Like	 American	and	British	oil	 magnates	in	the	early	part	of	the	century,
who	 saw	the	 oil	 business	as	an	 extension	of	  global	politics	  and	thereby
demanded	the	right	to	influence	foreign	policy,	Bulgheroni	was	a	man	possessed
by	an	idea.	Between	1995	and	1996	he	left	his	business	in	South	America	and
spent	nine	months	 in	 his	 executive	jet	 flying	 from	 warlord	 to	 warlord	 in
Afghanistan	and	 to	 Islamabad,	 Ashkhabad,	Moscow	 and	 Washington,	to
convince	leaders	that	his	pipeline	was	a	realistic	possibility.	Those	around	him
were	equally	 driven,	 if	  not	 by	 the	 same	dream,	than	 by	 the	 workaholic
Bulgheroni.
       Bulgheroni	is	descended	from	a	close-knit	family	of	Italian	immigrants	to
Argentina.	Charming,	erudite,	a	philosopher	captain	of	industry,	he	could	talk
for	hours	about	the	collapse	of	Russia,	the	future	of	the	oil	industry	or	Islamic
fundamentalism.	His	father	Alejandro	Angel	had	set	up	Bridas	in	1948	as	a	small
service	company	for	 Argentina's	new	 oil	  industry.	Carlos	 and	his	 brother
Alejandro	Bulgheroni,	who	was	Vice	 Chairman	of	Bridas,	took	the	company
international	in	1978	and	Bridas	became	the	third	largest	independent	oil	and	gas
company	in	Latin	America.	But	until	Turkmenistan,	Bridas	had	no	experience	of
operating	in	Asia.
       What	had	 brought	these	Argentinians	halfway	across	the	world	 to	ride
around	Afghanistan?	After	the	collapse	of	the	Soviet	Union,	Bridas	had	first
ventured	into	Western	Siberia,	‘But	there	were	too	many	problems	there	with
pipelines	and	 taxes	so	 we	 arrived	 in	 Turkmenistan	when	 it	  opened	up,’

200
Bulgheroni	 told	  me	 in	 the	 only	 interview	  he	 has	 given	 on	 Bridas's	 role	 in
Afghanistan.1	In	1991,	Bridas	took	 a	huge	risk	when	it	 became	the	first	Western
company	to	bid	 for	leases	in	Turkmenistan.	 At	 the	time,	Western	oil	 companies
called	the	decision	crazy.	 Turkmenistan	was	distant,	 landlocked	and	had	passed
no	legislation	to	protect	foreign	 investors.	‘Other	 oil	companies	shied	away	from
Turkmenistan	 because	they	thought	 it	 a	 gas	place	 and	had	 no	 idea	where	 to
market	it,’	 said	Bulgheroni.	 ‘Our	 experience	in	discovering	 gas	and	transporting
it	through	cross-border	pipelines	to	multiple	 markets	in	Latin	 America	convinced
me	that	the	same	could	be	done	in	Turkenistan.’	President	Niyazov	 was	flattered
by	the	attention	Bulgheroni	 paid	him,	 when	no	other	Western	oil	 executive	even
appeared	at	his	door,	and	the	two	men	struck	up	a	warm	friendship.
       In	  January	  1992,	 Bridas	  was	  awarded	 the	 Yashlar	  block	  in	  eastern
Turkmenistan	 close	  to	  the	 Afghan	  border	  and	 north-east	  of	  the	 massive
Daulatabad	gas	field	discovered	 by	the	Soviets.	A	 year	later,	 in	February	 1993,
Bridas	was	awarded	the	Keimir	block	 in	the	west	of	the	country	near	the	Caspian
Sea.	As	the	first	 and	 only	 entrant	to	Turkmenistan,	 Bridas	 received	favourable
terms	–	a	50-50	split	 in	profits	 in	Yashlar	 and	a	75-25	split	in	 profits	 in	Bridas's
favour	in	 Keimir.	 ‘We	 wanted	to	develop	new	oil	 and	gas	deposits	because	then
Russia	could	 not	object	 to	 new	 finds	 as	they	 would	 if	 we	 just	 developed	old
Soviet	era	fields,’	said	Bulgerhoni.
       Bridas	 invested	some	US$400	million	 in	 exploring	 its	leases	–	a	staggering
sum	in	those	early	 days	for	 a	small	oil	 company,	 when	not	even	the	 oil	 majors
were	involved	in	 Central	Asia.	Bridas	began	to	export	oil	 from	its	Keimir	 field	 in
1994,	with	 production	 rising	 to	16,800	 b/d.	Then	 in	July	 1995,	in	 the	hot,	 arid
Karakum	desert,	Bridas	 struck	 gold	–	 a	massive	new	 gas	field	 at	Yashlar	 with
estimated	reserves	of	 27	 tcf,	 more	 than	 double	 Pakistan's	total	  gas	reserves.
‘Unlike	 oil,	 gas	needs	an	immediate,	accessible	market,	so	we	set	about	devising
one,’	 said	Jose	Louis	 Sureda,	 Bridas's	gas	 transportation	 manager	–	 a	tough,
stout	 engineer	 who	  was	  to	  criss-cross	 Afghanistan	  in	  the	  months	 ahead
surveying	possible	routes.2
       ‘After	  discovering	 Yashlar	 we	wanted	part	 of	 the	gas	to	go	 north	through
old	Russian	pipelines,	but	 we	wanted	to	find	 alternative	markets	 and	these	were
either	China	 or	South	Asia,’	  said	Bulgheroni.	 ‘A	  pipeline	 through	Afghanistan
could	become	 a	peace-making	business	–	 difficult	  but	 possible,’	 he	added.	In
November	1994,	 just	as	the	 Taliban	captured	 Kandahar,	Bulgheroni	 persuaded
Niyazov	 to	 set	up	 a	working	  group	 to	 study	the	 feasibility	  of	 a	 gas	pipeline
through	Afghanistan	to	Pakistan.

201
       Four	  months	 later	 he	 had	persuaded	 Pakistan's	Prime	 Minister	  Benazir
Bhutto	  to	  join	  forces	  with	   Niyazov.	  On	  16	  March	  1995	  Pakistan	  and
Turkmenistan	signed	a	memorandum	allowing	 Bridas	to	prepare	a	pre-feasibility
study	of	  the	proposed	 pipeline.	 ‘This	  pipeline	 will	  be	 Pakistan's	gateway	 to
Central	Asia,	 it	 will	 open	up	 huge	possibilities,’	 Bhutto's	 husband	Asif	 Zardari
told	me.	Zardari	said	the	Taliban's	control	 of	the	pipeline	route	made	the	pipeline
viable.	Behind	the	desk	in	his	 office,	Zardari	 had	a	huge	map	of	the	route,	which
he	proudly	pointed	to.3
       By	 now,	the	Pakistani	military	 and	the	ISI	 were	backing	the	Taliban	to	open
up	a	southern	transportation	route	 via	Kandahar	 and	Herat	to	Turkmenistan.	 At
the	same	time,	Pakistan	was	also	 negotiating	with	 Qatar	 and	Iran	to	 obtain	gas
supplies	 through	  two	  separate	 pipelines,	 but	  in	  geo-strategic	  terms,	 with
Islamabad's	 abiding	 interests	 in	  Afghanistan	  and	 Central	  Asia,	  the	 Bridas
proposal	offered	the	greatest	opportunities.4
       Bridas	 proposed	building	 an	875-mile-long	 pipeline	 from	 its	Yashlar	 field,
crossing	southern	Afghanistan	 to	Sui	 in	Baluchistan	 province,	 where	Pakistan's
gas	reserves	 and	 pipeline	  network	  originates.	 The	  pipeline	  could	 later	  be
extended	to	 the	even	 bigger	 market	of	 India	  via	 Multan.	 Bridas	 proposed	an
open-access	pipeline	so	that	other	companies	and	countries	could	eventually	feed
their	own	 gas	into	it.	 This	was	particularly	 appealing	 to	the	Afghan	 warlords	 as
Afghanistan	had	gas	fields	in	the	north,	 which	once	supplied	Uzbekistan	 but	had
been	shut	down.	Bulgheroni	arrived	 to	woo	 the	Afghan	warlords.	 ‘I	 met	with	 all
the	leaders,	Ismael	Khan	 in	 Herat,	Burhanuddin	 Rabbani	and	Masud	 in	Kabul,
Dostum	 in	 Mazar	  and	 the	 Taliban	 in	  Kandahar.	 I	 was	 very	  well	  received
everywhere	because	the	Afghans	understood	they	needed	to	rebuild	 the	country
and	they	needed	foreign	investment,’	said	Bulgheroni.
       By	   February	 1996	  Bulghreoni	  reported	  to	  Bhutto	  and	 Niyazov	   that
‘agreements	have	been	reached	and	signed	with	the	warlords	 which	 assure	us	a
right	 of	 way’.5	 That	 month,	Bulgheroni	  signed	a	 30-year	 agreement	with	 the
Afghan	 government,	 then	headed	by	 President	 Burhanuddin	 Rabbani,	 for	 the
construction	 and	 operation	 of	 a	 gas	pipeline	 by	  Bridas	 and	 an	international
consortium	 which	 it	 would	  create.	Bridas	 opened	negotiations	 with	  other	 oil
companies	including	Unocal,	the	12th	largest	oil	 company	in	the	USA	 which	had
considerable	experience	in	Asia	 and	had	been	involved	 in	 Pakistan	since	1976.
Turkmen	officials	  had	met	 with	 Unocal	 for	 the	 first	 time	 in	Houston	 in	 April
1995,	 on	 an	 invitation	   from	  Bridas,	 and	  a	 Unocal	 delegation	  had	 visited
Ashkhabad	and	 Islamabad	 apparently	 to	 discuss	 joining	  Bridas	 to	 build	  the

202
pipeline.
       But	 Bridas	 was	now	facing	 major	problems	 in	Turkmenistan.	 Niyazov	 had
been	convinced	by	his	 advisers	that	Bridas	was	exploiting	  Turkmenistan	and	in
September	1994	the	government	blocked	oil	exports	from	 Keimir	 and	demanded
a	renegotiation	of	its	contract	with	 Bridas.	By	January	1995	the	issue	appeared	to
be	resolved	when	Bridas	agreed	to	reduce	its	take	by	 10	per	cent	to	65	per	cent.
When	Bridas	 discovered	gas	at	Yashlar,	 Niyazov	 and	his	 aides	refused	to	 join
Bridas's	celebrations	and	instead	demanded	to	renegotiate	both	 the	Yashlar	and
Keimir	  contracts	 once	 again.	 Niyazov	  stopped	 Bridas	 from	  developing	 the
Yashlar	field	  and	again	stopped	its	 oil	 exports	 from	 Keimir.	  This	time	 Bridas
said	it	 would	 not	 budge	 from	 the	original	  contracts	which	  Turkmenistan	 was
obliged	to	respect.
       Niyazov	  was	a	 communist-style	 dictator	 who	 had	 little	 understanding	 or
interest	in	  international	 law	 and	 contracts.	 But	 there	 were	 other	 reasons	for
Niyazov	 to	 turn	 the	 screws	 on	Bridas	  at	that	 precise	 moment.	 With	 Unocal
expressing	interest	in	 building	  its	own	 pipeline,	 using	 Turkmenistan's	 existing
gas	fields	at	Daulatabad,	the	 profit	 of	which	 would	 all	 accrue	to	Turkmenistan,
Niyazov	 saw	 that	 Unocal	  could	 become	 the	 means	to	  engage	a	 major	 US
company	 and	  the	  Clinton	  administration	   in	  Turkmenistan's	  development.
Niyazov	  needed	the	 Americans	  and	 began	 an	 intensive	 dialogue	  with	  US
diplomats.	The	 Americans	 needed	to	support	 him	 if	 they	were	 to	 prevent	him
from	becoming	 dependent	on	Iran.	Niyazov	 visited	the	UN	 and	summoned	both
Bridas	and	Unocal	to	New	York.	 There,	on	21	October	1995,	in	 front	of	 shocked
Bridas	executives,	Niyazov	signed	an	agreement	with	Unocal	 and	its	partner,	the
Saudi	 Arabia-owned	  Delta	 Oil	  Company,	  to	 build	  a	  gas	pipeline	  through
Afghanistan.	‘We	 were	 shocked	and	when	we	spoke	to	 Niyazov,	 he	just	turned
around	 and	 said	 “Why	  don't	 you	  build	 a	 second	 pipeline,”’	   said	 a	 Bridas
executive.6
       Looking	  on	at	 the	signing	 ceremony	was	Henry	 Kissinger,	 the	former	 US
Secretary	of	 State	and	then	 a	consultant	for	 Unocal.	 As	 Kissinger	 pondered	a
route	through	Afghanistan	 he	quipped	 that	the	deal	 looked	like	 ‘the	 triumph	 of
hope	over	experience’.	However,	 Bridas	 was	not	about	to	 give	up,	 and	the	first
battle	of	the	new	 Great	Game	had	begun.	‘We	are	just	 an	oil	 company	trying	 to
develop	a	 country's	 resources,	but	 we	 got	involved	  in	 somebody	 else	“Great
Game”	where	the	big	powers	 are	battering	each	other,’	Mario	 Lopez	Olaciregul,
Bridas's	Managing	Director	 said	later.7
       Unocal	 proposed	a	gas	pipeline	 from	 Daulatabad,	with	  gas	reserves	of	25

203
tcf,	to	Multan	 in	central	Pakistan.	Unocal	set	up	the	CentGas	consortium	holding
a	70-per-cent	stake,	giving	Delta	 15	per	cent,	Russia's	state	owned	gas	company
Gazprom	10	per	cent	and	the	state-owned	company	Turk-menrosgaz	 5	per	cent.
Unocal	 signed	 a	 second,	even	 more	 ambitious	 agreement	 with	 wide	  appeal
across	 the	 region.	  Unocal's	  Central	 Asian	  Oil	   Pipeline	  Project	 (CAOPP)
envisaged	a	1,050-mile	 oil	 pipeline	 from	 Chardzhou	in	 Turkmenistan	to	 an	oil
terminal	on	Pakistan's	coast,	delivering	one	million	 b/d	of	oil	 for	export.	 Existing
Soviet-era	oil	 pipelines	 from	  Surgut	and	 Omsk	 in	 Russia's	Siberian	 fields,	 to
Chymkent	 in	Kazakhstan	 and	Bukhara	 in	 Uzbekistan	 could	feed	 into	 CAOPP
delivering	oil	 from	all	 of	Central	Asia	 to	Karachi.
       ‘The	  strategy	 is	  to	 take	 advantage	 of	  the	 extensive,	 existing	  pipeline
network	to	 extend	the	entire	regional	 system	to	the	coast	allowing	  producers	of
Russia,	 Kazakhstan,	 Uzbekistan	  and	 Turkmenistan	  to	  access	 the	 growing
markets	of	Asia.	There	would	 be	a	commerce	corridor	across	Central	Asia,’	 said
Robert	 Todor,	 Unocal's	 Executive	  Vice-President.8	To	  avoid	 a	 repetition	 of
Chevron's	problems	 with	 Russia	in	 Kazakhstan,	 Unocal	 wooed	Moscow	 from
the	start.	Russia's	Siberian	oil	would	have	a	new	southern	outlet	to	the	sea,	while
Gazprom	had	a	stake	in	the	gas	pipeline.	‘We	 don't	have	a	Russian	problem	just
an	Afghan	problem.	 For	 everyone	it's	a	win-win	  situation,’	 Henry	 De	La	 Rosa,
Unocal's	manager	in	Turkmenistan	told	me.9
       The	 Clinton	 administration	  and	Unocal's	 sudden	interest	in	 Turkmenistan
and	Afghanistan	was	not	 accidental.	It	 was	preceded	by	a	significant	  change	in
US	 policy	  towards	 Central	 Asia.	 Between	 1991	  and	1995	 Washington	  had
strategically	 supported	 Kazakhstan	 and	 Kyrgyzstan	 as	 the	 two	 states	 which
would	swiftly	  bring	about	economic	 and	political	 liberalization,	 thereby	making
it	easier	for	US	companies	to	invest	there.	Kazakhstan	still	 held	nuclear	weapons
left	over	from	 the	Soviet	era	and	with	huge	oil,	 gas	and	mineral	reserves	Kazakh
President	Nursultan	Nazarbayev	was	personally	courted	by	 Presidents	Bush	and
Clinton.	But	 by	1995	 Nazarbayev	was	increasingly	seen	as	a	failure,	as	massive
corruption	riddled	 his	administration	and	he	became	increasingly	dictatorial.
       Kazakhstan	 had	 surrendered	its	 nuclear	weapons	 to	Russia	 by	 1993	and
with	40	per	 cent	of	its	population	 made	up	of	ethnic	 Russians,	who	were	openly
hostile	to	 the	government,	 Nazarbayev	was	forced	 to	bend	 to	Russia's	security
and	economic	 demands.	 For	 four	 years	 Kazakhstan	 was	unable	 to	 persuade
Russia	to	allow	 Chevron	 to	transport	 Tenghiz	 oil	 through	Russian	pipelines	 to
Europe.	A	  frustrated	 Chevron,	 which	 in	 1991	 had	 promised	 to	 invest	 US$5
billion	 in	 Tenghiz	had	cut	 back	its	commitment	 and	had	 invested	only	 US$700

204
million	 by	1995.10
       During	  this	  period	 (1991–95)	  the	 USA	  ignored	  Tajikistan	  which	 was
involved	 in	  a	 civil	  war,	 while	  Uzbekistan	 and	 Turkmenistan,	 ruled	 by	  two
dictators,	 were	  considered	 beyond	 the	 pale	  by	 the	  US	 State	 Department.
Moreover,	with	 the	Russo-centric	Deputy	Secretary	of	State	Strobe	Talbott	in	the
driving	  seat	of	  US	 policy	  towards	 the	 FSU,	  Washington	 was	 not	 keen	 to
antagonize	Moscow	and	challenge	its	abiding	 interests	in	Central	Asia.	 Talbott's
agenda	was	to	 enlist	 Russia	 in	 NATO	 and	 not	 create	problems	 in	 USRussia
relations	by	encroaching	on	Russia's	backyard.
       However,	 as	Russia	slipped	 into	 chaos,	Talbott's	pro-Russian	 policy	 came
under	bitter	attack	 from	 within	 the	US	foreign	 policy	 establishment,	the	 Jewish
and	Israeli	lobbies	in	Washington	 and	US	oil	 companies,	who	all	wanted	the	US
to	embrace	a	more	multi-dimensional	 foreign	 policy	 towards	the	 FSU.	One	that
would	 allow	 them	 to	 exploit	 the	 Caspian's	resources,	help	 the	Caspian	 states
assert	their	independence	from	Russia	and	enlist	them	in	 the	Western	camp.	US
oil	 companies,	who	 had	 spearheaded	the	first	 US	 forays	 into	 the	region	 now
wanted	a	greater	say	in	US	policy-making.
In	early	1995,	major	 US	oil	 companies	formed	a	private	 Foreign	Oil	 Companies
group	in	Washington	to	further	 their	interests	in	the	Caspian.	The	group	included
Unocal	and	they	set	about	hiring	 former	politicans	 from	 the	Bush	and	Carter	era
to	lobby	  their	 case	in	 Washington.11	The	 group	 met	 with	 Sheila	 Heslin,	 the
energy	expert	at	the	National	Security	Council	 (NSC)	and	later	in	 the	summer	of
1995	with	her	boss,	the	NSC	Adviser	 Samuel	Berger.	Berger	had	set	up	an	inter-
agency	government	  committee	 on	  formulating	  policy	  towards	 the	 Caspian,
which	included	several	government	departments	and	the	CIA.12
The	strategic	interest	 of	 Washington	and	 the	US	oil	  companies	in	the	 Caspian
was	  growing	   and	  Washington	  began	  to	   snub	  Russia.	  The	  immediate
beneficiaries	were	Uzbekistan	and	Turkmenistan.	 Washington	 had	scotched	one
attempt	by	 US	 lobbyists	 to	 promote	Niyazov.	  In	 March	 1993,	 a	former	 NSC
Adviser,	 Alexander	  Haig	  had	 been	 hired	 by	  Niyazov	  and	 brought	 him	  to
Washington	to	 try	 and	persuade	US	 companies	to	invest	 in	 Turkmenistan	 and
soften	the	 US	position	 on	 pipelines	 through	 Iran.	 The	visit	  was	a	 failure	 and
Niyazov	was	unable	to	meet	US	leaders.	But	by	1995	Washington	realized	that	if
it	kept	Niyazov	 at	arm's	length,	he	would	have	no	choice	but	to	fall	 back	on	Iran.
Turkmenistan's	economic	plight	 was	worsening	due	to	its	inability	 to	 sell	its	gas.
For	the	USA	 the	prospects	of	 a	gas	pipeline	 through	Afghanistan	 was	not	 only
attractive	because	it	avoided	 Iran,	but	 it	would	 signal	 support	to	 Turkmenistan,

205
Pakistan	and	the	Taliban	while	clearly	snubbing	Russia	and	Iran.
The	USA	 could	not	 develop	strategic	clout	 in	Central	 Asia	without	 Uzbekistan,
the	largest	and	most	powerful	  state	and	the	only	 one	capable	of	standing	 up	to
Russia.	Both	  cautiously	  wooed	 each	 other.	 Karimov	  became	 supportive	 of
NATO	  plans	 to	 build	  a	 Central	  Asian	 NATO	  battalion,	  a	 move	 that	  was
vehemently	opposed	by	 Russia.	‘We	 don't	accept	NATO	  in	 our	backyard.	 The
US	must	 recognize	 that	Central	 Asia	 will	  remain	 within	  the	“near	 abroad”	 –
Russia's	sphere	of	influence,’	 an	angry	Russian	diplomat	 told	me	 in	Ashkhabad
in	1997.13	US	companies	took	an	interest	 in	Uzbekistan's	 mineral	deposits,	and
trade	between	Uzbekistan	and	the	USA	suddenly	blossomed,	increasing	by	eight
times	between	 1995	and	 1997.	Karimov	  made	his	 first	 trip	 to	 Washington	 in
June	1996.	‘By	late	1995	the	West,	and	most	notably	 the	US,	had	clearly	chosen
Uzbekistan	  as	 the	  only	   viable	  counterweight	   both	  to	  renewed	  Russian
hegemonism	and	to	Iranian	influence,’	wrote	 Dr	Shireen	Hunter.14
       Thus	 there	were	the	makings	of	 two	coalitions	 emerging	in	 the	region.	The
US	  lining	   up	  alongside	  Uzbekistan,	   Turkmenistan	  and	  Azerbaijan	   and
encouraging	its	allies	 Israel,	 Turkey	 and	Pakistan	to	 invest	there,	while	 Russia
retained	its	grip	 on	Kazakhstan,	Kyrgyzstan	 and	Tajikistan.	 The	 USA	 was	now
prepared	to	confront	 Russia	as	the	battle	 for	 the	Caspian's	resources	escalated.
‘While	 US	 policy-makers	certainly	 do	 not	want	to	 see	a	hegemonic	Russia,	the
potential	costs	of	 such	hegemony	become	far	greater	if	 Russia	is	able	to	dictate
the	 terms	 and	limit	   Western	 access	to	 the	 world's	  last	 known	 oil	  and	 gas
reserves.	Even	minimum	 US	involvement	  here	provides	for	 maximum	 Russian
suspicion,’	 said	 Dr	 Martha	  Brill	  Olcott,	  a	 leading	 US	 academic	on	  Central
Asia.15
       I	 did	not	begin	 to	investigate	this	unfolding	 story	 until	the	summer	of	 1996.
The	sudden	capture	of	Kabul	by	 the	Taliban	in	 September	1996	prompted	me	to
try	and	unravel	two	 unanswered	questions	which	many	Western	journalists	were
grappling	with,	 but	failed	to	 answer.	Were	the	Americans	supporting	the	Taliban
either	directly	  or	indirectly	  through	 Unocal	 or	 their	 allies	 Pakistan	and	 Saudi
Arabia?	And	what	 was	prompting	this	massive	regional	polarization	 between	the
USA,	Saudi	 Arabia,	Pakistan	and	 the	Taliban	 on	one	side	and	Iran,	 Russia,	the
Central	Asian	  states	and	the	 anti-Taliban	 alliance	  on	the	 other?	 While	 some
focused	on	whether	 there	was	a	revival	 of	 the	old	 CIAISI	  connection	from	 the
Afghan	jihad	 era,	it	 became	apparent	to	me	that	the	strategy	over	 pipelines	had
become	the	driving	 force	behind	 Washington's	interest	in	 the	Taliban,	 which	 in
turn	was	prompting	a	counter-reaction	from	 Russia	and	Iran.

206
       But	 exploring	  this	was	like	  entering	a	labyrinth,	  where	nobody	 spoke	the
truth	or	 divulged	 their	 real	 motives	 or	 interests.	It	 was	 the	job	 of	 a	detective
rather	than	a	journalist	because	there	were	few	clues.	Even	gaining	access	to	the
real	players	in	 the	game	was	 difficult,	  because	policy	was	not	 being	driven	 by
politicians	 and	diplomats,	 but	 by	 the	 secretive	oil	 companies	 and	intelligence
services	of	the	regional	states.	The	oil	companies	were	the	most	secretive	of	all	a
legacy	of	the	fierce	 competition	 they	indulged	in	 around	the	world.	 To	spell	 out
where	they	 would	 drill	  next	 or	 which	 pipeline	  route	they	 flavoured,	 or	 even
whom	they	 had	 lunch	with	  an	hour	 earlier,	 was	giving	 the	 game	away	 to	the
enemy	rival	oil	 companies.
       Bridas	 executives	never	spoke	to	the	press	and	only	 issued	very	occasional
statements	from	 a	 discreet	public	  relations	 company	in	 London.	  Unocal	 was
more	 approachable	but	 their	 executives	 were	 primed	  to	 give	 bland	 answers
which	gave	 nothing	away.	 But	there	 was	a	marked	difference	 between	the	two
companies	which	was	to	affect	their	future	 relations	with	the	Taliban.	 Bridas	was
a	small	family	 company	whose	executives,	brought	up	in	the	European	tradition,
were	interested	 in	 the	 politics,	  culture,	 history	 and	 the	 personal	relations	  of
where	and	with	whom	they	 were	dealing.	Bridas	executives	were	knowledgeable
about	all	the	convolutions	 of	 the	Game	and	they	took	 the	trouble	 to	explore	the
ethnic,	tribal	and	family	 linkages	of	the	leaders	they	were	meeting.
       Unocal	 was	a	huge	corporation	 which	hired	 executives	to	run	 its	global	 oil
business.	Those	sent	out	to	the	region	were,	with	 a	few	exceptions,	interested	in
the	job	 rather	than	the	political	  environment	 they	were	 living	 in.	 While	 Bridas
engineers	would	spend	hours	sipping	tea	with	 Afghan	 tribesmen	in	the	desert	as
they	explored	routes,	Unocal	would	 fly	in	 and	out	and	take	for	granted	what	they
were	told	  by	 the	notoriously	  fickle	  Afghan	 warlords.	 Afghans	  had	long	 ago
mastered	the	art	of	telling	an	interlocuter	what	 he	wanted	to	hear	and	then	saying
exactly	 the	 opposite	to	 their	  next	 guest.	Unocal	  was	also	 at	 a	 disadvantage
because	its	policy	  towards	the	 Taliban	 did	 not	 deviate	from	  the	US	 line	 and
consequently	Unocal	lectured	the	Taliban	 on	what	 they	should	be	doing.	 Bridas
had	no	such	compunctions	and	was	 ready	to	sign	 a	deal	with	 the	Taliban,	 even
though	they	were	not	recognized	as	the	legitimate	government	by	any	state.
       Unocal	  tended	to	  depend	more	 on	 the	 US	 Embassy	 in	 Islamabad,	 and
Pakistani	and	Turkmen	 intelligence	 for	 information	  on	what	 was	happening	or
about	to	happen,	rather	than	gathering	their	own	information.	As	 my	stories	were
published	on	the	Bridas-Unocal	rivalry	 and	the	twists	 and	turns	of	the	new	Great
Game,	both	companies	at	first	thought	I	was	a	spy,	secretly	working	 for	the	other

207
company.	Unocal	persisted	in	this	belief	even	after	Bridas	had	realized	that	I	 was
just	a	very	 curious	 journalist	 who	 had	covered	 Afghanistan	 far	too	 long	 to	be
satisfied	with	 bland	statements.	It	took	 me	seven	months	of	travelling,	 over	 one
hundred	interviews	and	 total	immersion	 in	the	literature	 of	 the	oil	 business	–	of
which	I	 knew	 nothing	–	to	 eventually	 write	the	 cover	story	for	 the	Far	 Eastern
Economic	Reviewwhich	appeared	in	April	 1997.
       In	  July	  1997	 Strobe	 Talbott	  gave	  a	 speech	that	  was	 to	  become	 the
benchmark	for	US	 policy	 in	the	region.	 ‘It	 has	been	fashionable	to	proclaim,	 or
at	least	to	 predict,	 a	replay	 of	 the	“Great	 Game”	 in	 the	Caucasus	and	Central
Asia.	 The	 implication,	  of	 course,	is	 that	 the	 driving	  dynamic	 of	 the	 region,
fuelled	and	 lubricated	by	 oil,	 will	  be	the	competition	 of	 the	great	 powers.	Our
goal	is	 to	avoid,	 and	actively	 to	 discourage,	that	atavistic	 outcome.	Let's	 leave
Rudyard	 Kipling	  and	George	 McDonald	  Fraser	where	 they	 belong	 –	 on	 the
shelves	of	 history.	 The	Great	 Game	which	 starred	Kipling's	  Kim	  and	Fraser's
Flashman	was	very	much	of	the	zero-sum	variety.’
       But	 Talbott	 also	knew	 the	Game	was	 on	and	issued	a	grim	 warning	 to	 its
players,	 even	 as	 he	  declared	 that	  Washington's	 top	  priority	   was	 conflict
resolution.	‘If	  internal	 and	 cross-border	conflicts	 simmer	 and	flare,	 the	 region
could	become	a	breeding	ground	of	terrorism,	 a	hotbed	of	religious	 and	political
extremism	and	a	battleground	for	outright	war.’16
       On	   the	 ground,	  Niyazov's	   decision	  to	  sign	  with	   Unocal	  infuriated
Bulgheroni.	 In	 February	 1996	 he	 moved	 to	 the	 courts,	 filing	  a	case	 against
Unocal	and	Delta	 in	 Fort	Bend	 County,	near	Houston	 Texas.	Bridas	demanded
US$15	 billion	   in	 damages	 alleging	  ‘tortuous	  interference	 with	  prospective
business	relations’	and	 that	‘Unocal,	 Delta	 and	[Unocal	  Vice-President	Marty]
Miller	 and	 possibly	 others	engaged	in	 a	civil	  conspiracy	againt	 Bridas.’	 In	 its
court	deposition,	Bridas	 said	it	had	‘disclosed	 to	Miller	 its	 strategic	planning	for
the	 pipeline	 construction	  and	 operation.	 Bridas	  invited	  Unocal	  to	 consider
joining	 a	 joint	  venture	 arrangement’.17In	short,	 Bridas	 charged	 Unocal	 with
stealing	its	idea.
       Later,	  Bulgheroni	  explained	 how	 he	 felt.	  ‘Unocal	  came	 to	 this	 region
because	we	invited	them.	There	was	no	reason	why	we	and	Unocal	could	not	get
together.	We	wanted	 them	in	 and	took	 them	with	 us	to	 Turkmenistan,’	 he	told
me.	‘In	 the	beginning	the	US	 considered	this	pipeline	a	ridiculous	 idea	and	they
were	not	 interested	in	 either	 Afghanistan	 or	 Turkmenistan,’	  he	added.	Bridas
also	began	arbitration	 against	Turkmenistan	 with	 the	International	 Chamber	 of
Commerce	  for	   breach	  of	   contract	   in	   three	  separate	  cases	  regarding

208
Turkmenistan's	blockade	of	its	Yashlar	and	Keimir	 fields.
       Unocal	  maintained	 that	  its	 proposal	 was	 different	  because	it	  involved
Daulatabad	rather	than	 Yashlar	 gas	field.	 In	 a	 letter,	 later	submitted	 to	 court,
John	 Imle,	  President	  of	  Unocal,	  had	  written	  to	  Bulgheroni	   saying	  that
Turkmenistan	had	told	 him	that	the	government	 had	no	agreements	with	Bridas,
so	Unocal	 was	 free	 to	 do	what	 it	  liked.18	‘We	  maintained	 that	the	 CentGas
project	was	 separate	and	unique	from	 Bridas.	 We	 were	proposing	 to	purchase
gas	from	existing	natural	 gas	reserves	and	to	transport	the	gas	through	an	export
gas	pipeline.	Bridas	 was	proposing	to	 transport	gas	from	 their	 Yashlar	field	 …
the	CentGas	 project	 does	 not	 prevent	 Bridas	 from	 developing	  a	pipeline	  to
transport	and	market	its	own	gas,’	said	Imle.19
       The	 Clinton	 administration	 now	weighed	in	 on	behalf	of	 Unocal.	In	 March
1996	the	 US	 Ambassador	 to	 Pakistan	Tom	 Simmons	 had	 a	 major	 row	 with
Bhutto	when	 he	asked	her	to	 switch	 Pakistan's	support	from	 Bridas	 to	Unocal.
‘Bhutto	 supported	Bridas	 and	Simmons	 accused	Bhutto	 of	extortion	  when	she
defended	Bridas.	She	was	furious	 with	 Simmons,’	 said	 a	senior	aide	to	 Bhutto
present	in	 the	 meeting.	‘Bhutto	  demanded	a	 written	 apology	 from	  Simmons,
which	she	got,’	added	a	cabinet	minister.20
       During	 two	 trips	to	Pakistan	and	Afghanistan	in	 April	 and	August	1996,	the
US	Assistant	 Secretary	 of	 State	for	  South	 Asia	 Robin	 Raphel	 also	spoke	 in
favour	 of	  the	 Unocal	  project.	  ‘We	  have	 an	 American	  company	 which	  is
interested	in	 building	 a	pipeline	 from	 Turkmenistan	 through	 to	 Pakistan,’	said
Raphel	at	 a	press	 conference	in	 Islamabad	 on	 21	 April	  1996.	‘This	  pipeline
project	will	 be	very	 good	for	 Turkmenistan,	for	 Pakistan	and	for	Afghanistan	 as
it	 will	  not	 only	 offer	  job	 opportunities	 but	 also	 energy	in	  Afghanistan,’	  she
added.	In	August,	Raphel	visited	 Central	Asian	 capitals	and	Moscow	 where	she
pitched	the	same	message.
       Open	 US	 support	 for	  the	Unocal	  project	 aroused	an	 already	 suspicious
Russia	and	Iran,	which	 became	even	more	convinced	that	the	CIA	  was	backing
the	Taliban.	 In	 December	 1996,	a	 senior	Iranian	 diplomat	  told	 me	in	 hushed
tones	that	the	 Saudis	and	the	CIA	  had	channelled	US$2	 million	  dollars	 to	the
Taliban	  –	 even	  though	 there	  was	 no	  evidence	 for	  such	  suspicions.	 But
accusations	multiplied	on	all	 fronts	after	the	USA	 and	Unocal	committed	 several
blunders.
       When	 the	 Taliban	 captured	 Kabul	 in	  September	1996,	 Chris	 Taggert,	 a
Unocal	executive,	told	 wire	agencies	that	the	pipeline	 project	would	 be	easier	to
implement	now	 that	the	 Taliban	had	 captured	Kabul	 –	a	statement	that	 Unocal

209
quickly	 retracted	because	it	 implied	 that	Unocal	 flavoured	 a	Taliban	 conquest.
Just	a	few	weeks	earlier	 Unocal	had	 announced	it	would	 give	 humanitarian	aid
as	‘bonuses’	to	the	Afghan	 warlords,	once	they	agreed	to	form	 a	joint	council	 to
supervise	the	pipeline	project.	 Again	the	implication	  was	that	Unocal	was	ready
to	dish	out	money	to	the	warlords.
       Then,	  within	  hours	 of	  Kabul's	  capture	 by	  the	 Taliban,	  the	 US	 State
Department	announced	it	 would	establish	 diplomatic	 relations	with	 the	 Taliban
by	sending	 an	official	  to	 Kabul	 –	 an	 announcement	it	 also	quickly	  retracted.
State	 Department	  spokesman	 Glyn	   Davies	  said	  the	  US	  found	  ‘nothing
objectionable’	 in	 the	 steps	 taken	by	  the	Taliban	  to	 impose	 Islamic	 law.	 He
described	the	Taliban	as	anti-modern	rather	than	anti-Western.	US	Congressmen
weighed	in	 on	the	side	of	 the	Taliban.	 ‘The	 good	part	of	 what	 has	happened	is
that	one	 of	 the	factions	 at	 last	seems	capable	of	 developing	 a	 government	in
Afghanistan,’	 said	 Senator	Hank	 Brown,	 a	 supporter	of	 the	 Unocal	 project.21
Embarrassed	US	  diplomats	  later	 explained	  to	 me	  that	 the	 over-hasty	  US
statement	was	made	without	consulting	the	US	Embassy	in	Islamabad.
       But	 the	damage	done	was	enormous.	Unocal's	 gaffes	and	the	 confusion	in
the	State	Department	 only	 further	convinced	 Iran,	 Russia,	the	CARs,	 the	 anti-
Taliban	  alliance	  and	  most	  Pakistanis	  and	 Afghans	   that	  the	  US-Unocal
partnership	was	 backing	 the	Taliban	 and	 wanted	an	 all-out	 Taliban	 victory	  –
even	as	the	US	and	Unocal	claimed	they	had	no	favourites	in	Afghanistan.	 Some
Pakistani	cabinet	ministers,	anxious	to	show	that	 the	USA	supported	the	Taliban
and	Pakistan's	stance,	leaked	to	Pakistani	journalists	that	Washington	backed	the
Taliban.
       The	 entire	 region	  was	full	  of	  rumours	 and	speculation.	 Even	 the	 ever-
neutral	wire	 agencies	weighed	 in	 with	 their	 suspicions.	‘Certainly	  the	Taliban
appear	to	serve	the	US	policy	of	 isolating	 Iran	by	creating	 a	firmly	 Sunni	buffer
on	Iran's	border	and	potentially	 providing	 security	 for	trade	routes	and	pipelines
that	would	break	Iran's	monopoly	 on	Central	Asia's	southern	trade	routes,’	wrote
Reuters.22
       Bridas	 still	 faced	an	uphill	  climb	 to	ensure	that	they	 were	still	 in	 the	race.
Its	gas	and	oil	 fields	 in	 Turkmenistan	 were	blocked.	 It	 had	no	agreement	with
Turkmenistan	to	buy	 gas	for	a	pipeline	 and	none	with	Pakistan	to	 sell	gas.	With
US	 and	Pakistani	 support,	 the	 Taliban	  were	 now	 being	 courted	 by	 Unocal.
Nevertheless	Bridas	continued	to	 maintain	 its	offices	 in	 Ashkhabad	and	Kabul,
even	though	Niyazov	was	trying	 to	force	them	out.	‘Bridas	 is	out,	we	 have	given
the	Afghan	  pipeline	 to	 Unocal.	 Our	 government	 does	 not	 work	 with	  Bridas

210
anymore,’	 Murad	 Nazdjanov,	 Turkmen	 Minister	  for	  Oil	 and	 Gas	told	 me	 in
Ashkhabad.23
       Bridas	 had	one	advantage	with	the	Taliban.	Bridas	told	 them	it	did	 not	need
to	raise	finances	for	the	 project	through	international	 lending	 institutions,	 which
would	first	 demand	an	internationally	  recognized	government	in	 Kabul.	 Instead
Bridas	had	set	up	 TAP	Pipelines,	 a	50–50	partnership	 with	 the	Saudi	company
Ningarcho,	 which	 was	extremely	 close	to	 Prince	 Turki,	 the	 Saudi	intelligence
chief.	Bridas	 said	it	 could	 raise	50	 per	cent	of	 the	 funding	 from	 the	Saudis	to
build	 the	 Afghan	 portion	  of	 the	 pipeline	  and	the	 rest	 from	  an	international
consortium	it	 would	put	 together,	which	would	 build	 the	less	risky	 Pakistan	and
Turkmenistan	ends	of	 the	pipeline.	 ‘We	 will	 do	 a	complete	separation	between
our	 problems	 with	  the	 Turkmenistan	  government	 and	  the	 Afghan	  pipeline
contract.	We	will	 make	two	consortiums,	one	to	build	 the	Afghan	line	 and	one	to
build	the	Pakistan	and	Turkmenistan	ends	of	the	line,’	 said	a	Bridas	 executive.24
Bridas	 was	thus	 offering	  to	 start	work	  on	 the	pipeline	  immediately,	 without
preconditions.	It	 only	needed	some	agreement	between	the	Afghan	factions,	 but
even	that	was	to	remain	unobtainable.
       On	 the	 other	hand,	Unocal's	 position	 was	closely	 linked	 to	 US	 policy	 on
Afghanistan	that	it	 would	not	construct	 the	pipeline	or	discuss	commercial	terms
with	 the	Taliban,	until	 there	 was	a	recognized	government	in	 Kabul	 so	that	the
World	 Bank	and	others	could	 lend	money	 for	 the	project.	‘We	 made	it	 clear	to
all	parties	from	 the	beginning	 that	the	ability	  to	obtain	financing	 for	 the	project
was	critical,	 that	the	Afghan	 factions	 would	 have	to	get	together	and	 develop	a
functioning	 government	 that	was	recognized	 by	 lending	institutions	  before	the
project	 could	  succeed,’	 said	 John	 Imle.25	 Unocal's	 real	 influence	  with	  the
Taliban	was	that	their	project	 carried	the	possibility	 of	US	recognition	 which	 the
Taliban	were	desperately	anxious	to	secure.
       Both	 Bridas	 and	Unocal	 now	courted	 regional	powers	with	  influence	over
the	Taliban,	particularly	 the	Saudis.	In	their	 discussions	with	the	Taliban,	 Bridas
made	much	of	their	strong	 links	to	Prince	 Turki.	 ‘The	Saudis	had	many	years	of
investment	in	the	Afghan	 jihad	 and	they	really	 thought	this	 pipeline	would	 help
the	peace	process,’	said	Bulgheroni.	 Not	 to	 be	outdone,	 Unocal	had	 their	own
Saudi	connection.	 Delta	 Oil's	  President	Badr	 Al'Aiban	   is	 close	to	 the	 Saudi
Royal	Family,	 particularly	to	 Crown	Prince	Abdullah	 in	Abdul	 Aziz	 while	Badr's
brother	 Mosaed	 Al'Aiban	   was	 a	 member	  of	 King	  Fahd's	 court.	  Thus	 the
competition	 between	Unocal	 and	 Bridas	also	 reflected	 competition	 within	  the
Saudi	Royal	Family.

211
       The	USA	 and	Unocal	had	also	won	over	Pakistan.	After	 the	dismissal	of	the
Bhutto	government	in	 1996,	the	newly	elected	Prime	Minister	 Nawaz	 Sharif,	his
Oil	Minister	 Chaudry	Nisar	 Ali	 Khan,	the	army	and	the	ISI	 fully	 backed	Unocal.
Pakistan	wanted	more	 direct	 US	support	 for	 the	Taliban	 and	 urged	Unocal	 to
start	construction	quickly	  in	order	 to	legitimize	 the	 Taliban.	Basically	 the	USA
and	Unocal	 accepted	the	 ISI's	 analysis	 and	aims	 –	 that	 a	 Taliban	 victory	 in
Afghanistan	would	 make	Unocal's	job	much	easier	and	quicken	US	recognition.
       Apart	   from	  wanting	   US	  recognition	  for	  the	  Taliban,	  Pakistan	  also
desperately	needed	new	sources	of	gas	supply.	Gas	accounts	for	 37	per	cent	 of
Pakistan's	energy	consumption	and	the	largest	fields	 at	Sui	 in	Baluchistan	 were
running	out.	Pakistan's	proven	gas	reserves	of	22	tcf,	 faced	current	consumption
of	0.7	tcf	 per	year	and	an	annual	increase	in	demand	of	another	0.7	tcf	 per	year.
By	 2010	 Pakistan	 would	  face	 an	 annual	 0.8	 tcf	  per	 year	 shortfall	  in	 gas.
Islamabad's	other	options	–	 a	gas	pipeline	 from	 Iran	or	 one	from	 Qatar	–	were
stalled	for	 lack	of	 funding.	 Pakistan	was	 also	desperate	for	assured	supplies	of
cheaper	oil.	In	 1996	it	 imported	US$2	 billion	 worth	 of	 oil,	equivalent	 to	20	 per
cent	of	its	total	imports.	 Domestic	oil	production	 had	dropped	from	70,000	b/d	in
the	early	 1990s	to	 just	 58,000	b/d	 in	 1997.	The	 proposed	Unocal	 oil	 pipeline
would	not	 only	 supply	Pakistan,	but	 also	turn	 the	country	 into	 a	major	hub	 for
Central	Asian	oil	 exports	to	Asian	markets.
       President	 Niyazov	 also	 wanted	 Unocal	 to	 start	construction	 immediately
and	urged	Pakistan	to	force	the	Taliban	to	accept	the	Unocal	proposal.	Niyazov's
wooing	of	the	US	began	to	pay	dividends.	In	 January	1997,	Turkmenistan	signed
an	agreement	with	  the	 US	 oil	 giant	 Mobil	  and	 Monument	 Oil	  of	 Britain	  to
explore	for	 oil	 over	 a	large	 tract	 of	western	 Turkmenistan.	 It	 was	the	first	  oil
contract	Turkmenistan	had	signed	with	 a	major	US	 company	as	Unocal	had	still
made	no	direct	investment	in	Turkmenistan.
       In	 November	1996	Bridas	 said	it	had	signed	an	agreement	with	the	Taliban
and	General	 Dostum	 to	 build	  the	 pipeline,	 while	  Burhanuddin	 Rabbani	 had
already	agreed.	 That	 panicked	 Unocal	 and	 Pakistan.	 On	 9	 December	 1996,
Pakistan's	 Foreign	  Secretary	 Najmuddin	   Sheikh	  visited	  Mullah	   Omar	  in
Kandahar	to	persuade	him	to	accept	the	Unocal	proposal,	but	Omar	gave	no	firm
commitment.	 In	  the	 classic	 Afghan	  manner	 the	 Taliban	 played	  their	 cards
adroitly,	 remaining	 elusive	and	noncommittal	 thereby	 forcing	 both	 Unocal	and
Bridas	to	up	their	 bids.	The	Taliban	were	 not	just	interested	in	receiving	 rent	for
the	pipeline	route	which	 could	be	US$100	million	  a	year,	but	also	to	involve	 the
oil	 companies	in	building	  roads,	water	supplies,	 telephone	lines	and	 electricity

212
power	lines.
       Privately	  several	Taliban	 leaders	said	 that	they	 preferred	Bridas,	 because
Bridas	made	no	demands	upon	them	while	 Unocal	 was	urging	them	 to	improve
their	human	 rights	 image	and	 to	 open	talks	 with	 the	 anti-Taliban	 alliance	 the
main	plank	 of	 US	 policy.	 Moreover,	 Unocal	 was	 facing	 the	growing	 feminist
movement	 in	 the	 US	  which	  demanded	that	 the	 USA	  and	 Unocal	  suspend
negotiations	 with	   the	  Taliban.	  The	  UN	   was	 also	  critical.	   ‘The	  outside
interference	 in	 Afghanistan	 is	  now	 all	 related	 to	 the	 battle	  for	 oil	  and	 gas
pipelines.	The	fear	 is	that	these	companies	and	regional	powers	 are	just	renting
the	Taliban	 for	 their	own	 purposes,’	 Yasushi	Akashi,	 the	UN	  Under	Secretary
General	for	Humanitarian	Affairs	 told	 me.26
       Both	  companies	 insisted	 that	 their	 pipeline	  would	 bring	  peace,	but	 no
Western	bank	 would	 finance	 a	 pipeline	 in	 a	country	 at	 war	 with	 itself.	  ‘The
players	in	the	 game	of	pipeline	 politics	 must	remind	 themselves	that	peace	can
bring	 a	pipeline,	 but	 a	 pipeline	 cannot	bring	 peace,’	 said	Robert	 Ebel.27	The
Great	Game	had	entered	a	new	dimension.

                    ROMANCING	         THE	   TALIBAN	        2:
                   THE	   BATTLE	       FOR	   PIPELINES	       –
                      THE	   USA	   AND	   THE	   TALIBAN
                                               1997–99

	
The	attractive	mini-skirted	Argentinian	secretaries	at	Bridas	headquarters	in
Buenos	Aires	had	been	told	to	cover	up	–	long	dresses	and	long-sleeved	blouses
to	show	as	little	of	their	limbs	as	possible.	A	Taliban	delegation	was	expected	in
Buenos	Aires.	When	they	arrived	in	February	1997,	Bridas	treated	them	royally,
taking	them	sightseeing,	flying	them	across	the	country	to	see	Bridas's	drilling
operations	and	gas	pipelines	and	visiting	the	icy,	snow-capped	southern	tip	of
the	Continent.
      At	 the	same	time,	another	Taliban	delegation	was	experiencing	a	different
kind	of	culture	shock.	They	were	in	Washington	where	they	met	with	State
Department	officials	and	Unocal	and	lobbied	for	US	recognition	for	their
government.	On	their	return	the	two	delegations	stopped	off	in	Saudi	Arabia,
visiting	Mecca	and	meeting	with	the	Saudi	Intelligence	chief	Prince	Turki.	The
Taliban	said	they	had	not	yet	decided	which	company's	offer	to	accept.	They	had
quickly	learned	how	to	play	the	Great	Game	from	all	angles.1
      Both	companies	stepped	up	their	efforts	to	woo	the	Taliban.	Bridas	received
a	boost	in	January	1997	when	the	International	Chamber	of	Commerce	issued	an
interim	court	order	telling	Turkmenistan	to	allow	Bridas	to	resume	its	oil	exports
from	the	Keimir	field.	But	President	Niyazov	ignored	the	decision,	refusing	to
compromise	with	Bridas.	In	March	1997	Bridas	opened	an	office	in	Kabul	and
Bulgheroni	arrived	to	meet	Taliban	leaders.
      Bridas	actually	began	to	negotiate	a	contract	with	the	Taliban.	It	took	weeks
of	painstaking	work	through	the	summer	for	three	Bridas	executives	to	negotiate
the	150-page	document	with	12	Taliban	mullahs,	who	had	no	technical	experts
amongst	them	apart	from	an	engineering	graduate,	who	had	never	practised
engineering.	The	Taliban	had	no	oil	and	gas	experts	and	few	who	spoke
adequate	English,	so	the	contract	was	translated	into	Dari.	‘We	are	going
through	it	line	by	line	so	that	nobody	can	accuse	us	of	trying	to	dupe	the	Taliban.
We	will	get	the	same	contract	approved	by	the	opposition	groups	so	it	will	be	an

215
all-Afghan	 agreement,’	a	senior	Bridas	executive	 told	me.2	Unocal	had	declined
to	negotiate	a	contract	until	there	was	a	recognized	government	in	Kabul.
       Meanwhile	  Unocal	had	donated	US$900,000	 to	the	Centre	 of	Afghanistan
Studies	at	the	 University	  of	 Omaha,	Nebraska	which	  was	headed	by	 Thomas
Gouttierre,	 a	veteran	Afghanistan	 academic.	 The	Centre	 set	up	 a	training	 and
humanitarian	aid	 programme	 for	 the	 Afghans,	 opening	 a	school	 in	 Kandahar
which	was	 run	by	 Gerald	Board-man,	 who	 in	 the	1980s	had	run	 the	Peshawar
office	 of	the	 US	Agency	 for	 International	 Development	providing	  cross-border
assistance	to	 the	 Mujaheddin.	 The	 school	 began	 to	 train	 some	 400	 Afghan
teachers,	electricians,	carpenters	and	pipe-fitters	to	help	Unocal	 lay	the	pipeline.
Unocal	gave	the	Taliban	other	 gifts	such	as	a	fax	and	a	generator,	which	 caused
a	scandal	when	the	story	broke	later	in	the	year.
       Whatever	  Unocal	 gave	 to	 the	 Taliban	 only	  further	 convinced	 the	 anti-
Taliban	alliance	and	Iran	 and	Russia	that	the	company	was	funding	 the	Taliban.
Unocal	vehemently	denied	the	charges.	Later	Unocal	specified	to	me	what	 it	had
spent	on	the	project.	‘We	have	estimated	that	we	spent	approximately	US$15–20
million	 on	 the	CentGas	project.	 This	included	 humanitarian	 aid	for	 earthquake
relief,	 job-skill	  training	  and	some	 new	 equipment	 like	 a	 fax	 machine	 and	 a
generator,’	Unocal's	President	John	Imle	told	me	in	1999.3
       Delta's	  role	  also	  increased	 external	  suspicions.	  Initially	   Unocal	  had
encouraged	Delta	Oil,	 with	  its	Saudi	 origins	 and	Taliban	 contacts,	to	 woo	 the
Afghan	factions.	 Rather	than	hiring	eminent	 Saudis	to	do	the	job,	Delta	 hired	an
American,	Charles	Santos,	to	liaise	with	 the	Afghans.	Santos	had	worked	on	and
off	 for	 the	UN	  mediation	 effort	 for	 Afghanistan	 since	 1988,	despite	 criticism
from	two	 subsequent	UN	mediators	that	he	was	too	close	to	the	 US	government
and	had	a	personal	agenda.	Santos	had	become	the	political	  adviser	to	 the	UN
mediator	Mehmood	Mestiri,	 who	led	the	disastrous	UN	mediation	 effort	 in	1995,
when	the	 Taliban	  were	at	 the	 gates	of	  Kabul.	 Santos	was	 already	 intensely
disliked	by	 all	the	Afghan	 leaders,	especially	the	Taliban,	 when	Delta	hired	 him
and	nobody	trusted	him.	It	 was	a	mistake	and	Unocal	later	regretted	the	decision
after	Santos	failed	to	make	any	headway	with	 the	Afghans	despite	repeated	trips
into	the	country.
       As	  tensions	 developed	 between	 Unocal	  and	 Delta	  because	of	  Delta's
inability	 to	woo	the	Afghans,	 Unocal	set	up	its	own	team	of	experts	to	advise	the
company	on	Afghanistan.	It	 hired	Robert	 Oakley,	the	former	 US	Ambassador	to
Pakistan	and	later	the	US	Special	Envoy	to	Somalia.	Oakley	had	played	a	critical
role	in	 providing	 US	 support	to	 the	Mujaheddin	 in	 the	 1980s,	but	that	 did	 not

216
endear	him	  to	  the	 Afghans	  as	 the	 USA	  subsequently	 walked	  away	 from
Afghanistan.	  Many	  Afghans	  and	 Pakistanis	  considered	 him	  arrogant	  and
overbearing	–	his	 nickname	in	 Islamabad	during	his	 tenure	as	Ambassador	was
‘The	 Viceroy’.	 Oakley	 travelled	 to	 Moscow	 and	Islamabad	to	 win	 support	 for
the	project	 and	 helped	Unocal	  hire	 other	experts.	 These	included	 Gouttierre,
Boardman,	 Zalmay	  Khalilzad	   an	 Afghan-American	   worked	  for	  the	  Rand
Corporation	and	the	Central	Asian	expert	Martha	Brill	  Olcott.
       For	 a	US	corporation	 to	hire	ex-US	 government	officials	 or	academics	was
not	unusual.	All	  the	US	oil	 companies	playing	 the	Great	 Game	were	doing	 the
same	in	 order	to	 lobby	 Washington	 and	 they	 were	hiring	  even	bigger	 names
from	 the	Reagan	and	Bush	 administrations	than	 Unocal	 was.	But	 this	was	 not
understood	in	the	region	 and	was	viewed	 with	 enormous	suspicion,	 reinforcing
speculation	that	 Unocal	 was	a	policy	  arm	of	 the	 US	government	 and	that	 the
1980s	network	of	US-CIA	 Afghan	 experts	was	being	revived.
       Unocal	  now	 also	faced	 immense	problems	 with	 President	 Niyazov,	 who
was	as	far	removed	from	 reality	as	ever.	Refusing	 to	accept	the	problems	posed
by	the	constant	fighting	in	 Afghanistan,	he	urged	Unocal	to	start	work	 as	quickly
as	possible.	When	 his	 terrified	 Foreign	 Ministry	  officials	 tried	 to	 explain	 that
construction	could	 not	 start	in	 the	middle	 of	 a	civil	 war,	 he	would	 shout	 them
down.	‘We	 want	 the	pipeline.	 We	 link	 all	 of	 our	 largest	projects	to	 peace	and
stability	  in	 Afghanistan,’	  Niyazov	  told	  me	 angrily.4	 Subsequently	 Turkmen
officials	 were	 too	 afraid	 to	even	 inform	 their	 boss	 of	 the	bad	 news	from	 the
Afghan	front	 and	Niyazov	became	more	isolated	from	reality.
       Despite	 these	problems	 Unocal	 pushed	ahead.	In	May	 1997	 at	an	 annual
regional	summit	 in	 Ashkhabad,	 Pakistan,	Turkmenistan	 and	Unocal	 signed	 an
agreement,	which	  committed	  Unocal	  to	  raising	 the	  finances	 and	 reaching
financial	 closure	 for	 the	 project	 by	 December	 1997,	starting	 construction	  by
early	1998.	The	 USA	 and	Turkmenistan	 had	been	informed	 by	the	 ISI	that	 the
Taliban	were	 on	 the	verge	 of	 capturing	 the	northern	 opposition	 stronghold	 of
Mazar-e-Sharif.	However,	 two	weeks	later	the	Taliban	 were	driven	out	of	 Mazar
with	 hundreds	of	 casualties	and	 fighting	 intensified	  across	Afghanistan.	 Once
again,	over-dependence	on	ISI	analysis	had	embarrased	the	US.
       At	  the	first	 meeting	of	 the	CentGas	working	  group	in	 Islamabad	after	 the
débâcle	in	Mazar,	 Unocal	 Vice-President	Marty	  Miller	 expressed	grave	doubts
that	Unocal	 could	 meet	its	 December	1997	 deadline.	‘It's	  uncertain	when	 this
project	will	  start.	It	depends	on	peace	in	Afghanistan	 and	a	government	we	 can
work	with.	 That	 may	be	the	end	of	 this	year,	next	year	or	 three	years	from	now

217
or	 this	 may	  be	 a	 dry	  hole	 if	  the	 fighting	  continues,’	  Miller	   told	 a	 press
conference	on	5	 June	1997.	 Pakistan	and	Turkmenistan	 were	 forced	to	 sign	 a
new	contract	with	 Unocal	 extending	the	 company's	deadline	by	another	year	 to
start	the	project	by	December	1988.	To	most	observers	even	that	was	considered
overly	optimistic.
       By	 now,	there	was	growing	 scepticism	in	 Washington	that	Pakistan	and	the
Taliban	 could	 deliver	 a	 unified	 Afghanistan.	  As	 a	result,	 the	 USA	  began	to
explore	other	options	to	help	Turkmenistan	 deliver	its	gas.	In	a	dramatic	reversal
of	 policy	  the	 USA	  announced	in	  July	 1997	 that	  it	 would	  not	 object	  to	 a
Turkmenistan–Turkey	  gas	  pipeline	  which	   would	   cross	 Iran.	  Washington
maintained	that	 its	 decision	 was	not	 a	U-turn	  on	its	 sanctions	regime	 against
Iran.	Nevertheless,	as	European	and	Asian	oil	 companies	scrambled	to	enter	the
Iranian	 market,	 US	 companies	saw	 a	window	  of	 opportunity	  and	 intensified
pressure	on	the	Clinton	administration	to	ease	US	sanctions	on	Tehran.5
       The	 opportunity	  to	 transport	 Caspian	oil	  and	gas	 through	 Iran	 made	an
unpredictable	Afghan	pipeline	 even	less	viable.	Washington's	decision	came	as	a
blow	to	Unocal	 and	a	sharp	reminder	to	Islamabad	that	US	support	was	fickle	 at
the	best	of	 times	 and	 that	time	 was	 running	 out	 for	 the	 Taliban	 to	unify	  the
country	 through	  conquest.	 Moreover,	  Iran	  and	 Australia's	  BHP	  Petroleum
announced	they	would	sponsor	a	US$2.7	 billion,	 1,600-mile-long	 Iran–Pakistan
gas	pipeline	that	would	 deliver	2	billion	  cubic	feet	per	day	 of	gas	from	 southern
Iran	to	Karachi	 and	later	to	 India.	 The	advantage	of	this	 pipeline,	which	 was	in
direct	 competition	  to	 Unocal,	  was	 that	  it	 would	  run	  through	 territory	  not
devastated	by	a	civil	war.
       On	 16	October	 1997	Prime	 Minister	 Nawaz	Sharif	 paid	 a	one-day	visit	 to
Ashkhabad	to	 talk	 to	 Niyazov	 about	 the	Unocal	 project.	 As	 a	result,	 Unocal,
Pakistan	and	Turkmenistan	 signed	a	tentative	 pricing	 agreement	for	the	 import
of	Turkmen	 gas,	in	which	 the	Taliban	 were	given	 15	cents	per	1,000	cubic	 feet
as	a	transit	fee	for	the	pipeline	 across	their	territory.6By	 now	there	was	an	air	of
distinct	 unreality	 surrounding	 the	decisions	 by	Sharif	 and	 Niyazov,	 who	 were
ignoring	  the	 fighting.	   The	 Taliban	  were	  incensed	 because	they	  were	 not
consulted	about	the	gas	price	and	they	demanded	a	larger	transit	fee.
       Unocal	  company	  announced	 an	  enlarged	 CentGas	 consortium	  on	  25
October	 1997,	 which	 included	  oil	 companies	 from	 Japan,	 South	 Korea	 and
Pakistan.7	However,	Unocal's	attempt	to	woo	 the	Russians	had	failed.	Although
10	per	cent	shares	in	CentGas	were	reserved	for	Gazprom,	the	Russian	gas	giant
refused	to	 sign	 as	Moscow	 criticized	  US	 sponsorship	of	 the	 Taliban	 and	the

218
undermining	 of	 Russian	influence	 in	 Central	 Asia.8Gazprom's	chief	 executive
Rem	 Vyakhirev	   declared	  that	  Russia	 would	  not	  allow	   Turkmenistan	  or
Kazakhstan	to	export	its	 oil	and	gas	through	non-Russian	pipelines.	 ‘To	 give	up
one's	market	…	 would	 be,	at	the	very	 least,	a	crime	 before	Russia,’	 Vyakhirev
said.9
       US	 officials	  had	already	 made	their	 anti-Russia	 policy	  clear.	‘US	 policy
was	 to	 promote	  the	 rapid	 development	  of	 Caspian	 energy	 …	  We	  did	 so
specifically	  to	 promote	  the	 independence	of	  these	 oil-rich	  countries,	 to	  in
essence	break	Russia's	monopoly	control	over	the	transportation	of	oil	 from	 that
region,	and	frankly,	 to	 promote	Western	energy	security	 through	diversification
of	supply,’	 said	Sheila	Heslin,	the	energy	expert	at	the	NSC.10
       Bridas	 remained	 in	 the	running,	 this	 time	 with	 a	 powerful	 partner	 which
even	Washington	could	not	object	to.	In	 September	1997	Bridas	sold	60	per	cent
of	its	 company's	stake	in	Latin	 America	 to	the	 US	oil	 giant	Amoco,	 raising	 the
possibility	 that	Amoco	  could	influence	 Niyazov	 to	 ease	off	 on	Bridas's	 frozen
assets	in	Turkmenistan.	 Bridas	invited	  a	Taliban	 delegation	headed	by	 Mullah
Ahmad	Jan,	the	former	carpet	dealer	and	now	Minister	 for	 Industries,	to	Buenos
Aires	 for	 a	second	visit	  in	 September.	Pakistani	 authorities	refused	 to	 let	 the
Taliban	 fly	  out	 from	  Peshawar	until	  they	 had	 also	 agreed	 to	 visit	  Unocal.
Another	Taliban	 delegation	headed	by	the	 one-eyed	Mullah	 Mohammed	Ghaus
arrived	in	Houston	to	meeet	with	 Unocal	in	November	1997	where	they	were	put
up	in	a	five-star	 hotel,	visited	 the	zoo,	supermarkets	and	the	Nasa	Space	Centre.
They	had	dinner	at	the	 home	of	Marty	 Miller,	  admiring	 his	swimming	 pool	and
large	comfortable	house.	The	Taliban	met	with	 officials	 at	the	State	Department,
where	once	again	they	asked	for	US	recognition.11
       After	 the	winter	 lull	 in	Afghanistan,	 fresh	fighting	 broke	out	in	the	spring	of
1998	and	for	 both	companies	the	project	 appeared	as	distant	as	ever.	In	March,
Marty	Miller	  said	in	Ashkhabad	that	the	project	was	on	indefinite	 hold	because	it
was	not	 possible	to	 finance	while	  the	war	 continued.	As	 Niyazov	 fumed	 with
impatience,	 Unocal	 asked	for	  another	extension,	 beyond	 December	 1998,	 to
reach	financial	closure.	Unocal	 was	also	facing	increasing	problems	at	home.	At
its	annual	shareholders’	meeting	in	June	1998,	some	shareholders	objected	to	the
project	because	of	the	Taliban's	treatment	of	Afghan	 women.	American	 feminist
groups	began	to	muster	American	public	support	against	the	Taliban	and	Unocal.
       Throughout	 1998	the	feminist	 pressure	on	Unocal	intensified.	In	 September
1998	a	group	of	 Green	activists	asked	California's	 Attorney	 General	to	dissolve
Unocal	 for	  crimes	 against	  humanity	 and	  the	 environment	  and	 because	of

219
Unocal's	relations	with	 the	Taliban.	Unocal	 described	the	charges	as	‘ludicrous’.
Unocal	first	 attempted	to	counter	the	feminists	and	then	became	distant	in	trying
to	answer	 their	 charges.	It	 was	 a	losing	  battle	because	these	were	 American
women	 and	 not	  foreigners,	 wanting	  answers	 to	 an	  issue	 that	 the	 Clinton
administration	now	supported.
       ‘We	 disagree	with	some	US	feminist	 groups	on	how	Unocal	should	respond
to	this	 issue	…	we	 are	guests	in	countries	 who	have	sovereign	 rights	and	 their
own	 political,	  social	 and	religious	  beliefs.	 No	 company,	 including	  ours,	 can
solve	these	 issues	alone.	 Walking	 away	 from	  Afghanistan	 –	 either	 from	 the
pipeline	project	or	our	 humanitarian	projects,	would	 not	help	solve	the	problem,’
said	John	Imle.12
       The	 US	bombing	 of	 Bin	 Laden's	camps	in	 August	 1998	forced	 Unocal	to
pull	out	 its	staff	 from	 Pakistan	and	Kandahar	and	finally,	  in	December	1998,	 it
formally	 withdrew	 from	the	CentGas	consortium,	which	 it	 had	struggled	so	hard
to	set	up.	The	 plunge	in	 world	 oil	 prices	which	 had	hit	 the	world's	 oil	 industry
also	hit	Unocal	hard.	Unocal	 withdrew	 from	 a	pipeline	project	in	 Turkey,	closed
its	  offices	   in	  Pakistan,	  Turkmenistan,	   Uzbekistan	  and	  Kazakhstan	  and
announced	a	40-per-cent	drop	in	its	capital	spending	plan	for	1999	due	to	low	 oil
prices.	Unocal's	 only	  victory	  in	 these	 difficult	  days	 was	 over	 Bridas.	 On	 5
October	1998,	 the	Texas	 District	 Court	 dismissed	 Bridas's	US$15	 billion	  suit
against	Unocal	–	 on	the	 grounds	that	the	 dispute	was	governed	by	 the	laws	 of
Turkmenistan	and	Afghanistan,	not	Texas	law.
       With	  the	USA	 now	 preoccupied	with	  capturing	Bin	  Laden,	it	 seemed	for
the	moment	that	one	phase	of	the	Great	Game	was	now	over.	It	was	clear	that	no
US	company	 could	build	 an	 Afghan	 pipeline	 with	 issues	such	as	the	Taliban's
gender	policy,	 Bin	 Laden	 and	the	 continuing	 fighting.	  That	should	 have	been
clearer	to	Unocal	 much	earlier	on,	 but	it	 never	was	as	the	Taliban	 and	Pakistan
kept	promising	 them	a	quick	 victory.	 Bridas	remained	in	 the	running	 but	kept	a
low	profile	  during	the	 following	  difficult	  months.	Even	though	 the	project	 was
all	 but	over,	 Pakistan	persisted	 in	 trying	 to	 keep	it	 alive.	 In	 April	  1999,	 at	a
meeting	in	Islamabad,	Pakistan,	Turkmenistan	and	the	Taliban	tried	to	 revive	the
project	and	 said	they	 would	 look	 for	 a	new	 sponsor	for	 CentGas,	but	by	 now
nobody	wanted	to	touch	Afghanistan	 and	the	Taliban	and	foreign	 investors	were
staying	clear	of	Pakistan.
       US	 strategy	in	Central	Asia	 was	‘a	cluster	 of	confusions’	 according	to	Paul
Starobin	and	‘arrogant,	muddled,	naive	and	dangerous’	according	to	Martha	Brill
Olcott.	Author	 Robert	 Kaplan	 described	the	region	as	a	‘frontier	  of	 anarchy’.13

220
Yet	 the	 USA,	  now	 fervently	  rooting	  for	 the	 Baku-Ceyhan	  pipeline	 despite
crashing	oil	  prices	and	 a	refusal	 by	 oil	 companies	 to	 invest,	 persisted	in	 the
belief	 that	  pipelines	  could	 be	  built	  without	  a	 strategic	  vision	  or	 conflict
resolution	in	the	region.
       After	  providing	 billions	  of	 dollars’	 worth	 of	 arms	and	ammunition	  to	the
Mujaheddin,	 the	USA	 began	to	 walk	 away	from	 the	Afghan	 issue	after	 Soviet
troops	completed	their	withdrawal	 in	1989.	That	walk	 became	a	run	in	1992	after
the	fall	of	 Kabul.	Washington	allowed	 its	allies	in	 the	region,	Pakistan	and	Saudi
Arabia,	free	rein	 to	sort	out	the	ensuing	Afghan	 civil	 war.	 For	ordinary	 Afghans
the	 US	  withdrawal	   from	   the	 scene	 constituted	  a	  major	  betrayal,	  while
Washington's	refusal	to	harness	international	pressure	to	help	broker	a	settlement
between	the	warlords	  was	considered	a	 double	 betrayal.	Other	 Afghans	 were
furious	 at	the	USA	 for	 allowing	  Pakistan	a	free	 hand	in	 Afghanistan.	 The	 US
strategic	 absence	 allowed	   all	  the	  regional	  powers,	  including	   the	  newly
independent	CARs,	to	prop	up	competing	warlords,	thereby	intensifying	 the	civil
war	and	 guaranteeing	its	 prolongation.	 The	pipeline	 of	 US	 military	  aid	to	 the
Mujaheddin	 was	never	replaced	by	 a	pipeline	 of	international	 humanitarian	 aid
that	could	have	been	an	inducement	for	 the	warlords	to	 make	peace	and	rebuild
the	country.
       After	  the	 end	of	 the	Cold	  War,	Washington's	 policy	  to	the	 Afghanistan-
Pakistan-Iran-Central	 Asia	  region	  was	 stymied	  by	 the	  lack	 of	  a	  strategic
framework.	 The	  USA	 dealt	  with	  issues	as	 they	 came	 up,	 in	  a	 haphazard,
piecemeal	fashion,	rather	than	applying	a	coherent,	strategic	vision	to	the	region.
There	are	several	distinct	phases	of	US	 policy	 towards	the	Taliban,	 which	were
driven	 by	 domestic	American	  politics	 or	 attempted	 quick-fix	  solutions	 rather
than	a	strategic	policy.
       Between	 1994	and	1996	the	USA	 supported	the	Taliban	politically	  through
its	allies	Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia,	 essentially	because	Washington	viewed	the
Taliban	 as	 anti-Iranian,	  anti-Shia	 and	  pro-Western.	 The	 USA	  conveniently
ignored	 the	 Taliban's	 own	  Islamic	 fundamentalist	  agenda,	its	  supression	of
women	 and	 the	 consternation	 they	 created	 in	 Central	 Asia	  largely	 because
Washington	was	not	interested	in	the	larger	picture.	 Between	1995	and	1997	US
support	was	even	more	 driven	 because	of	its	 backing	for	 the	 Unocal	project	 –
even	though	at	the	time	the	USA	had	no	strategic	plan	towards	accessing	Central
Asian	energy	 and	thought	 that	 pipelines	 could	 be	built	  without	 resolutions	 to
regional	civil	 wars.
       The	  US	 policy	   turnaround	 from	  late	 1997	  to	 today	  was	 first	  driven

221
exclusively	by	the	effective	 campaign	of	American	 feminists	against	the	Taliban.
As	 always	 with	 the	 Clinton	  agenda,	domestic	 political	  concerns	 outweighed
foreign	 policy-making	  and	the	 wishes	of	  allies.	Clinton	  only	 woke	 up	 to	 the
Afghanistan	 problem	 when	American	  women	 knocked	on	 his	 door.	 President
and	Mrs	 Clinton	 had	 relied	heavily	  on	the	 American	 female	vote	 in	 the	1996
elections	and	on	female	 support	during	 the	Monica	 Lewinsky	 saga.	They	could
not	afford	 to	 annoy	 liberal	 American	 women.	 Moreover,	 once	Hollywood	  got
involved	 –	 its	 liberal	 stars	were	 key	 financiers	 and	supporters	of	 the	 Clinton
campaign	and	Vice-President	Albert	Gore	 was	anxious	to	retain	their	support	for
his	own	 election	 bid-there	 was	 no	 way	 the	US	 could	 be	 seen	as	soft	 on	 the
Taliban.
       In	  1998	 and	1999	 the	 Taliban's	 support	 for	 Bin	 Laden,	 their	  refusal	to
endorse	the	Unocal	 project	 or	 compromise	 with	 their	 opponents	and	 the	new
moderate	government	 in	 Iran	provided	  additional	 reasons	for	 the	USA	  to	get
tough	with	 the	Taliban.	 In	1999	 ‘getting	 Bin	 Laden’	was	Washington's	 primary
policy	objective,	 even	as	it	ignored	 the	new	Islamic	 radicalism	Afghanistan	 was
fostering,	 which	  would	  in	  time	  only	  throw	 up	  dozens	 more	 Bin	  Ladens.
Nevertheless,	late	as	it	 was,	 for	 the	 first	 time	 the	USA	 was	 genuinely	 on	the
peace	train	and	gave	full	support	to	UN	mediation	efforts	 to	end	the	war.
       US	 policy	 has	been	too	preoccupied	with	 wrong	assumptions.	When	 I	first
spoke	to	diplomats	at	the	US	Embassy	in	Islamabad	after	the	Taliban	emerged	in
1994,	they	were	 enthusiastic.	The	Taliban	 had	told	 the	stream	of	US	 diplomats
who	 visited	  Kandahar	 that	 they	 disliked	  Iran,	 that	 they	 would	  curb	 poppy
cultivation	  and	 heroin	 production,	  that	 they	  were	 opposed	 to	 all	  outsiders
remaining	in	 Afghanistan	including	 the	Arab-Afghans	 and	they	had	no	 desire	to
seize	power	or	rule	the	country.	 Some	US	diplomats	 saw	them	as	messianic	do-
gooders	 –	 like	  born-again	  Christians	  from	  the	 American	   Bible	  Belt.	  US
diplomats	  believed	  that	  the	  Taliban	  would	   meet	  essential	 US	  aims	  in
Afghanistan	–	‘eliminating	  drugs	and	thugs’,	one	diplomat	said.	It	was	a	patently
naive	hope	given	the	 Taliban's	social	base	and	because	they	themselves	did	not
know	what	they	represented	nor	whether	they	wanted	state	power.
       There	 was	not	 a	word	 of	US	 criticism	 after	 the	Taliban	 captured	Herat	 in
1995	and	threw	out	thousands	of	girls	from	 schools.	In	fact	 the	USA,	along	 with
Pakistan's	ISI,	 considered	Herat's	 fall	 as	 a	help	 to	 Unocal	 and	tightening	  the
noose	around	Iran.	Washington's	aim	 of	using	the	 Taliban	to	 blockade	Iran	was
equally	shortsighted,	because	it	was	to	pitch	Iran	 against	Pakistan,	Sunni	against
Shia	and	 Pashtun	against	 non-Pashtun.	‘Whatever	 the	 merits	 of	 the	 isolation

222
policy	 towards	Iran	 in	 the	 fight	 against	terrorism,	 they	 incapacitate	the	 US	 in
Afghanistan,’	 wrote	Barnett	 Rubin.14	Iran,	already	paranoid	 about	CIA	 plots	 to
undermine	it,	 went	 into	 overdrive	 to	demonstrate	CIA	  support	for	 the	 Taliban
while	 stepping	 up	its	 own	 arming	 of	 the	 anti-Taliban	  alliance.	‘US	  policy	 is
forcing	 us	to	 join	 Russia	and	the	 anti-Taliban	 alliance	 against	Pakistan,	Saudi
Arabia	and	the	Taliban,’	an	Iranian	diplomat	 said.15
       Some	US	diplomats,	 concerned	with	the	lack	of	 direction	 in	Washington	on
Afghanistan,	have	admitted	 that	there	was	no	 coherent	US	policy,	 except	 to	go
along	with	 what	Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	wanted.	In	 a	confidential	 1996	State
Department	memo	written	just	before	the	Taliban	 captured	Kabul,	parts	of	which
I	read,	analysts	wrote	that,	if	the	Taliban	 expanded,	Russia,	India	and	Iran	would
support	the	 anti-Taliban	  alliance	 and	the	 war	 would	  continue;	 that	 the	USA
would	 be	torn	 between	 supporting	its	 old	 ally	  Pakistan	and	trying	  to	 prevent
antagonizing	 India	 and	 Russia	 with	 whom	  the	 USA	 was	 trying	  to	 improve
relations.	In	such	a	situation,	 the	State	Department	surmised,	the	USA	could	 not
hope	to	 have	a	coherent	 policy	 towards	 Afghanistan.	 In	 a	US	 election	 year	a
coherent	Afghan	policy	 was	not	particularly	necessary	either.
       There	  was	  another	 problem.	  Few	  in	  Washington	  were	 interested	  in
Afghanistan.	Robin	 Raphel,	the	US	 Assistant	Secretary	of	 State	for	 South	Asia
and	the	key	policy	 maker	for	 Washington's	Afghan	 policy	 at	the	time,	 privately
admitted	that	there	was	little	 interest	in	 her	initiatives	 on	 Afghanistan	higher	 up
the	chain	 of	 command	in	 Washington.	 Secretary	of	 State	 Warren	Christopher
never	mentioned	Afghanistan	once	during	 his	entire	tenure.	Raphel's	attempts	to
float	the	idea	 of	an	international	 arms	embargo	on	Afghanistan	 through	 the	UN
Security	Council	  drew	little	  support	from	 the	 White	 House.	In	 May	 1996	 she
managed	to	push	through	a	debate	on	Afghanistan	in	the	UN	 Security	Council	 –
the	first	  in	 six	 years.	And	 in	  June,	Senator	Hank	 Brown,	  with	 support	 from
Raphel,	 held	  Senate	Hearings	  on	 Afghanistan	  and	  conducted	 a	 three-day
conference	in	  Washington	 between	 leaders	 of	 the	 Afghan	  factions	 and	 US
legislators,	which	Unocal	 helped	fund.16
       Raphel	 recognized	the	dangers	emanating	from	 Afghanistan.	 In	May	 1996
she	told	the	US	Senate,	‘Afghanistan	has	become	a	conduit	for	 drugs,	crime	and
terrorism	that	can	undermine	Pakistan,	the	neighbouring	Central	Asian	states	and
have	an	impact	beyond	Europe	and	Russia.’	She	said	extremist	training	camps	in
Afghanistan	were	 exporting	 terrorism.17But	Raphel's	perserverance	turned	 into
patchwork	  diplomacy,	  because	 it	  was	 not	  underpinned	 by	  a	  serious	 US
commitment	towards	the	region.

223
       When	  the	 Taliban	 captured	 Kabul	  in	 September	 1996,	 the	 CIA,	  again
encouraged	by	ISI	 analysis,	considered	 that	a	Taliban	 conquest	of	 the	 country
was	now	possible	and	that	the	Unocal	project	could	reach	fruition.	 The	USA	 was
silent	on	the	Taliban's	 repression	of	Kabul's	 women	and	the	dramatic	 escalation
in	fighting	 and	in	 November	Raphael	urged	all	 states	to	engage	the	Taliban	and
not	isolate	them.	‘The	 Taliban	control	 more	than	two-thirds	 of	 the	country,	 they
are	Afghan,	they	are	indigenous,	they	have	demonstrated	staying	power.	The	real
source	of	their	 success	has	been	the	willingness	 of	many	 Afghans,	 particularly
Pashtuns,	to	tacitly	trade	unending	fighting	and	chaos	for	a	measure	of	peace	and
security,	 even	with	  severe	social	 restrictions,’	  said	 Raphel.	 ‘It	  is	 not	 in	 the
interests	of	 Afghanistan	 or	 any	 of	 us	 here	that	 the	 Taliban	 be	 isolated,’	 she
added.18
       Several	 concerned	American	commentators	 noted	the	inconsistency	 of	US
policy	 at	the	 time.	‘The	 US,	 although	 vocal	 against	the	ongoing	 human	rights
violations,	 has	not	 spelled	out	 a	clear	 policy	 towards	 the	country	 and	has	 not
taken	a	strong	and	forthright	public	 stand	against	the	interference	in	Afghanistan
by	its	 friends	 and	 erstwhile	 allies	 –	 Saudi	Arabia	  and	Pakistan,	whose	 aid	 –
financial	and	otherwise	–	enabled	the	Taliban	to	capture	Kabul.’19
       The	 US	and	Unocal	wanted	to	believe	 that	the	Taliban	would	 win	and	went
along	 with	 Pakistan's	 analysis	 that	 they	 would.	 The	 most	 naive	 US	 policy-
makers	hoped	that	the	Taliban	 would	emulate	US–Saudi	 Arabia	relations	 in	the
1920s.	‘The	 Taliban	 will	  probably	 develop	like	  the	Saudis	did.	 There	 will	  be
Aramco,	pipelines,	 an	emir,	 no	parliament	 and	lots	 of	Sharia	 law.	We	 can	live
with	that,’	 said	one	US	diplomat.20	Given	their	suspicions,	it	was	not	unexpected
that	the	anti-Taliban	alliance,	Iran	 and	Russia,	should	view	the	Unocal	project	 as
an	arm	of	US-CIA	  foreign	policy	  and	as	the	key	to	US	 support	for	 the	Taliban.
Unocal's	links	with	 the	US	government	became	a	subject	of	massive	speculation.
US	 commentator	Richard	  Mackenzie	 wrote	 that	 Unocal	 was	 being	 regularly
briefed	by	the	CIA	 and	the	ISI.21
       Unocal	 neither	admitted	 nor	denied	receiving	 State	Department	support,	as
any	US	company	 would	 have	in	a	 foreign	 country,	but	 it	 denied	links	 with	 the
CIA.	  ‘Since	  Unocal	 was	 the	  only	  US	 company	  involved	  in	 the	  CentGas
consortium,	State	Department	 support	for	 that	 route	became,	de	 facto,	support
for	CentGas	and	Unocal.	At	the	same	time,	Unocal's	policy	 of	political	 neutrality
was	well	known	 to	the	US	 Government,’	Unocal	 President	John	Imle	told	 me.22
Unocal's	 failure	 was	 that	 it	 never	 developed	 a	relationship	  with	 the	 Afghan

224
factions,	which	were	independent	of	the	US	and	Pakistan	governments.
       There	was	a	bigger	 problem.	Until	 July	1997	when	 Strobe	Talbott	made	his
speech	in	 Washington,	 the	 USA	 had	 no	 strategic	plan	 for	  accessing	Central
Asia's	energy.	US	oil	 companies	were	faced	with	 what	they	could	 not	do,	rather
than	what	 they	could	 do	 since	they	 were	forbidden	 to	 build	 pipelines	 through
Iran	and	Russia.	When	 Washington	finally	  articulated	 its	policy	 of	 ‘a	 transport
corridor’	  from	  the	 Caspian	 to	  Turkey	 (avoiding	  Russia	 and	  Iran),	 the	 oil
companies	were	 reluctant	to	 oblige	 given	 the	 costs	and	 the	turbulence	 in	 the
region.	The	essential	issue	which	the	USA	 declined	to	 tackle	was	peace-making
in	the	 region.	Until	  there	was	an	end	 to	the	civil	  wars	in	 Central	 Asia	and	 the
Caspian	(Afghanistan,	 Tajikistan,	  Georgia,	 Chechnya,	Nagorno-Karabakh,	 the
Kurdish	issue)	and	there	was	a	 broad	consensus	with	Iran	and	Russia,	pipelines
would	 neither	be	safe	 to	build	 nor	 commercially	 feasible,	 as	every	step	 of	the
way	Iran	and	Russia	would	block	or	even	sabotage	them.
       It	  was	in	 the	interests	 of	 Iran	and	 Russia	to	 keep	the	 region	unstable	 by
arming	the	anti-Taliban	 alliance,	so	that	 US	pipeline	plans	could	 never	succeed.
Even	today	the	USA	 is	 muddled	on	 the	critical	 question	of	 whether	it	 wants	to
save	Central	Asia's	depressed	economies	by	letting	them	export	energy	any	way
they	like	  or	 to	 keep	Iran	  and	Russia	 under	blockade	 as	 far	 as	pipelines	 are
concerned.
       The	 USA	  and	Unocal	  were	 essentially	faced	 with	  a	simple	  question	in
Afghanistan.	Was	 it	 preferable	to	rely	 on	 Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	 to	 deliver
the	Taliban	and	obtain	 a	temporary	Afghan	 concensus	in	the	old-fashioned	 way
by	reconquering	 the	 country?	Or	 was	 it	 preferable	 for	 the	USA	  to	engage	in
peacemaking	and	bring	the	Afghan	ethnic	groups	and	factions	together	to	form	 a
broad-based	 government,	  which	  might	  ensure	  lasting	  stability?	  Although
Washington's	broad-brush	 policy	 was	 to	 support	a	 widely	 based,	multi-ethnic
government	in	 Kabul,	 the	USA	 for	 a	time	 believed	in	 the	Taliban	 and	when	 it
ceased	to	do	so,	it	was	not	willing	to	rein	in	 Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia.
Although	 there	was	no	 CIA	 budget	for	 providing	  arms	and	ammunition	 to	 the
Taliban	and	Unocal	did	not	 channel	military	 support	to	the	Taliban,	the	USA	 did
support	the	 Taliban	  through	 its	 traditional	 allies	  Pakistan	and	 Saudi	 Arabia,
accepting	 their	  provision	  of	  arms	  and	 funding	  to	  the	 Taliban.	  ‘The	   US
acquiesced	in	supporting	 the	Taliban	 because	of	 our	links	  to	the	 Pakistan	and
Saudi	governments	who	backed	them.	But	 we	no	longer	do	so	and	we	 have	told
them	categorically	 that	we	need	a	settlement,’	 the	highest	ranking	 US	diplomat
dealing	with	 Afghanistan	 said	 in	1998.23	In	 Washington	it	 was	perhaps	not	 so

225
much	a	covert	 policy	 as	no	policy.	 A	 covert	 policy	 involves	 planning,	 funding
and	taking	decisions,	 but	there	was	no	 such	process	taking	place	at	 the	highest
levels	in	Washington	on	Afghanistan.
       Washington's	 change	 of	 heart	 over	 the	 Taliban	 in	 late	 1997	 also	 arose
because	of	 the	  deteriorating	 political	   and	 economic	 crisis	  in	 Pakistan.	 US
officials	 began	to	voice	fears	that	the	drugs,	terrorism	and	Islamic	fundamentalist
threat	which	  the	Taliban	  posed	could	 overwhelm	  its	 old	 and	now	  decidedly
fragile	 ally	 Pakistan.	 The	 USA	 warned	 Pakistan	of	  the	increasing	 dangers	it
faced,	but	became	frustrated	with	the	ISI's	refusal	to	 pressurize	the	Taliban	to	be
more	flexible	on	the	political	 and	gender	fronts.
       The	 first	 public	  expression	of	 the	 US	change	 was	made	by	 Secretary	 of
State	Madeleine	Albright	 when	she	visited	Islamabad	in	November	1997.	On	 the
steps	of	Pakistan's	Foreign	 Office	 she	called	 the	Taliban	 ‘despicable’	 for	 their
gender	 policies.	  Inside,	  she	 warned	  Pakistani	 officials	   that	  Pakistan	 was
becoming	isolated	in	Central	 Asia	–	which	 weakened	US	leverage	in	the	region.
But	the	Sharif	regime	remained	at	odds	with	 itself,	wanting	 to	become	an	energy
conduit	for	 Central	Asia,	 wanting	 peace	in	Afghanistan	but	 insisting	 this	would
best	be	achieved	by	a	Taliban	victory.	Pakistan	could	not	 have	a	Taliban	victory,
access	to	 Central	 Asia,	 friendship	 with	  Iran	 and	 an	 end	to	  Bin	 Laden-style
terrorism,	all	at	the	same	time.	It	 was	a	self-defeating,	deluded	and	contradictory
policy	which	 Pakistan	refused	even	to	acknowledge.
       The	 shift	 in	US	 policy	 was	also	because	of	major	 changes	in	Washington.
The	dour,	hapless	Warren	Christopher	 was	replaced	by	Albright	 as	Secretary	of
State	in	early	 1997.	Her	 own	experiences	as	a	child	 in	 Central	Europe	 ensured
that	human	rights	 would	 figure	prominently	  on	her	agenda.	A	 new	team	of	 US
diplomats	began	 to	deal	 with	 Afghanistan	 in	 both	 Washington	 and	Islamabad
and	the	 new	 US	 Assistant	 Secretary	 for	  South	 Asia,	 Karl	  Inderfurth,	 knew
Afghanistan	as	a	former	journalist	 and	was	much	closer	to	 Albright	 than	Raphel
was	to	Christopher.
       Albright's	  private	criticism	 of	 Pakistan's	policies	and	public	criticism	  of	the
Taliban	 was	followed	  up	by	 the	 visit	 of	 the	 US	Ambassador	 to	the	 UN,	 Bill
Richardson,	to	Islamabad	 and	Kabul	 in	April	  1998.	But	 with	 Pakistan	exerting
no	real	 pressure	on	the	Taliban,	 except	 advising	 them	to	 give	 Richardson	full
protocol,	 the	  trip	  turned	 into	  little	  more	  than	 a	 public	  relations	  exercise.
Richardson's	agreements	with	the	Taliban	were	 rescinded	hours	later	by	Mullah
Omar.	The	 only	 positive	spin	 from	 the	trip	 was	 that	it	 convinced	 Iran	that	 the
USA	now	saw	Tehran	as	a	dialogue	partner	in	future	Afghan	peace	talks,	thereby

226
reducing	US–Iranian	tensions	over	Afghanistan.
       As	 with	  Raphel's	initiatives	 in	 1996,	 the	USA	 appeared	to	 be	dipping	 its
fingers	into	 the	Afghan	 quagmire,	 but	wanted	 no	real	 responsibility.	 The	USA
wished	to	avoid	 taking	sides	or	 getting	involved	 in	 the	nuts	and	bolts	 of	peace-
making.	The	 Pakistanis	realized	this	weakness	and	tried	 to	negate	US	pressure.
Foreign	 Minister	 Gohar	 Ayub	  blasted	 the	Americans	  just	 before	Richardson
arrived.	‘The	 Americans	are	thinking	 of	 putting	puppets	there	[in	 Kabul].	 These
are	people	who	 hover	around	in	 Pakistan	from	 one	 cocktail	 party	to	 the	other,
they	do	not	 cut	much	 ice	because	they	have	no	 support	in	 Afghanistan,’	 Ayub
said	on	a	visit	to	Tokyo.24
       US	 tensions	with	 Pakistan	increased	substantially	after	Bin	 Laden's	attacks
against	US	Embassies	in	Africa	in	 August	1998.	The	fact	that	the	ISI	 had	helped
introduce	Bin	 Laden	 to	the	 Taliban	 in	 1996	and	had	 maintained	contacts	with
him,	 but	  now	  declined	  to	 help	  the	 Americans	  catch	  him,	  created	 major
difficulties	 in	 the	relationship.	The	American	 tone	became	much	harsher.	‘There
appears	to	 be	 a	 pervasive	 and	 dangerous	 interplay	 between	 the	 politics	  of
Pakistan	and	the	turmoil	 inside	Afghanistan.	 With	 the	emergence	of	the	Taliban
there	 is	 growing	  reason	 to	 fear	 that	 militant	   extremism,	 obscurantism	 and
sectarianism	will	 infect	surrounding	 countries.	None	of	those	countries	has	more
to	lose	than	Pakistan	if	“Talibanization”	  were	to	spread	further,’	 said	US	Deputy
Secretary	of	State	Strobe	Talbott	in	Janury	1999.25
       But	 the	Americans	 were	not	prepared	to	publicly	  criticize	 Saudi	support	to
the	Taliban	 publicly,	 even	though	 they	privately	  urged	Saudi	Arabia	 to	 use	its
influence	on	the	Taliban	 to	deliver	Bin	 Laden.	Even	US	Congressmen	were	now
raising	 the	 self-defeating	  contradictions	  in	  US	 policy.	  ‘I	   have	 called	 into
question	 whether	 or	  not	  this	 administration	   has	 a	 covert	  policy	  that	 has
empowered	the	Taliban	and	enabled	this	brutal	 movement	to	hold	 on	to	power,’
said	Congressman	Dana	Rohrabacher	in	April	  1999.	‘The	 US	 has	a	very	 close
relationship	 with	  Saudi	  Arabia	 and	 Pakistan,	  but	 unfortunately,	  instead	 of
providing	leadership,	we	are	letting	them	lead	our	policy,’	  he	said.26
       The	 problem	for	 Pakistan	was	that	 Washington	had	 demonized	Bin	 Laden
to	such	an	extent	that	 he	had	become	a	hero	for	 many	 Muslims,	 particularly	 in
Pakistan.	US	policy	was	again	a	one-track	agenda,	solely	focused	on	getting	Bin
Laden,	rather	than	 tackling	 the	wider	 problems	of	 Afghanistan-based	terrorism
and	peace-making.	Washington	appeared	to	have	a	Bin	Laden	 policy	 but	not	an
Afghanistan	policy.	 From	supporting	the	Taliban	 the	USA	had	now	moved	to	the
other	extreme	of	rejecting	them	completely.

227
       The	 US	rejection	of	 the	Taliban	was	largely	because	of	the	pressure	exerted
by	 the	feminist	  movement	 at	 home.	 Afghan	 women	 activists	  such	as	 Zieba
Shorish-Shamley	had	persuaded	the	Feminist	Majority	  to	spearhead	a	signature
campaign	to	 mobilize	 support	 for	 Afghan	 women	 and	force	 Clinton	 to	 take	a
tougher	stance	against	the	Taliban.	Three	hundred	women's	groups,	trade	unions
and	human	rights	groups	signed	up.	The	campaign	got	a	major	propaganda	boost
when	Mavis	 Leno,	 the	wife	  of	comedian	 Jay	Leno	 pledged	US$100,000	 to	it.
‘The	US	 bears	some	responsibility	for	 the	conditions	 of	women	 in	Afghanistan.
For	years	our	country	 provided	 weapons	to	the	 Mujaheddin	 groups	to	fight	 the
Soviets,’	Ms	Leno	told	 a	Congressional	hearing	in	March	1998.27
       With	  Leno's	help,	 the	Feminist	 Majority	 organized	 a	massive	star-studded
party	after	 the	1999	 Oscars	to	 honour	 Afghan	 women.	‘The	  Taliban's	war	 on
women	 has	 become	 the	  latest	 cause	 celebre	 in	  Hollywood.	  Tibet	  is	  out.
Afghanistan	is	 in,’	 wrote	 the	Washington	 Post.28	As	a	celebrity	 in	 a	celebrity-
dominated	culture	 Leno	and	 her	opinions	 went	far.	 Hillary	  Clinton,	 anxious	to
secure	feminist	support	for	 her	future	political	  career	weighed	in	with	 statement
after	statement	condemning	the	Taliban.	 ‘When	 women	 are	savagely	beaten	by
so-called	religious	police	 for	not	 being	fully	 covered	or	 for	making	 noises	while
they	walk,	we	know	 that	is	not	just	the	physical	 beating	that	is	the	objective.	It	 is
the	destruction	 of	the	 spirit	 of	 these	women,’	 said	Mrs	 Clinton	 in	 a	 speech	in
1999.29	US	 policy	  appeared	to	 have	 come	 full	  circle,	 from	  unconditionally
accepting	the	Taliban	to	unconditionally	 rejecting	them.

                         PAKISTAN'S	           AFGHAN	        WAR




	
In	the	last	days	of	June	1998,	there	was	pandemonium	in	Pakistan's	Finance	and
Foreign	Ministries.	Senior	bureaucrats	scuttled	between	the	two	ministries	and
the	Prime	Minister's	Secretariat	with	bulging	briefcases	full	of	files	that	needed
signatures	from	various	ministers.	In	a	few	days	on	30	June	the	1997/8	financial
year	expired	and	the	new	financial	year	began.	Every	ministry	was	trying	to	use
up	its	funds	for	the	present	year	and	procure	higher	allocations	for	the	coming
year	from	the	Finance	Ministry.	 A	few	 weeks	earlier	(28	May)	 Pakistan	had
tested	six	nuclear	devices	following	 India's	tests	and	the	 West	had	slapped
punitive	sanctions	on	both	countries,	creating	a	major	foreign	currency	crisis	for
Pakistan	and	worsening	the	deep	recession	that	had	gripped	the	economy	since
1996.
       Nevertheless,	on	28	June	the	cash-strapped	Finance	Ministry	authorized
300	million	rupees	(US$6	million)	in	salaries	–	for	the	Taliban	administration	in
Kabul.	The	allocation	would	allow	the	Foreign	Ministry	to	dispense	50	million
rupees	every	month	for	the	next	six	months	to	pay	the	salaries	of	Afghanistan's
rulers.	The	Foreign	Ministry	needed	to	hide	this	money	in	its	own	budget	and
that	of	other	ministries,	so	that	it	would	not	appear	on	the	1998/9	budget	record
and	be	kept	 away	from	 the	prying	 eyes	of	 international	donors,	who	 were
demanding	massive	cuts	in	 government	spending	to	  salvage	the	crisis-hit
economy.
       In	1997/8	Pakistan	provided	the	Taliban	with	an	estimated	US$30	million
in	aid.1	This	included	600,000	tons	of	wheat,	diesel,	petroleum	and	kerosene	fuel
which	was	partly	paid	for	by	Saudi	Arabia,	arms	and	ammunition,	ariel	bombs,
maintenance	and	spare	parts	for	its	Soviet-era	military	equipment	such	as	tanks
and	heavy	artillery,	repairs	and	maintenance	of	the	Taliban's	airforce	and	airport
operations,	road	building,	electricity	supply	in	Kandahar	and	salaries.	Pakistan
also	facilitated	the	 Taliban's	own	 purchases	of	arms	and	ammunition	 from
Ukraine	and	Eastern	Europe.	The	money	given	for	salaries	was	seldom	used	for

230
that	purpose	and	 went	 directly	 into	 the	 war	 effort.	 Taliban	 officials	  in	 Kabul
were	not	paid	for	 months	at	a	time.	 Officially	  Pakistan	denied	it	was	supporting
the	Taliban.
       This	 flow	 of	 aid	was	a	legacy	 from	 the	past.	During	 the	1980s	the	ISI	 had
handled	the	billions	 of	US	dollars	 which	 had	poured	in	from	 the	West	and	Arab
states	to	help	the	Mujaheddin.	 With	 encouragement	and	technical	 support	from
the	CIA,	 that	money	had	also	been	used	to	carry	 out	an	enormous	expansion	of
the	 ISI.	  The	 ISI	  inducted	  hundreds	 of	 army	  officers	  to	  monitor	  not	 just
Afghanistan,	 but	 India	  and	 all	 of	  Pakistan's	foreign	  intelligence	  as	well	  as
domestic	politics,	the	economy,	the	media	and	every	aspect	of	social	and	cultural
life	in	the	country.
       The	 CIA	 provided	 the	latest	technology,	 including	 equipment	that	 enabled
the	ISI	to	 monitor	 every	telephone	call	in	 the	country.	 The	ISI	 became	the	eyes
and	ears	of	President	Zia's	military	regime	and	by	1989	it	 was	the	most	powerful
political	 and	foreign	policy	 force	in	 Pakistan,	repeatedly	overriding	later	 civilian
governments	and	 parliament	 in	 policy	 areas	it	 concluded	 were	 critical	 to	 the
country's	 national	  security	 interests.	  Primarily	  those	 areas	 were	 India	  and
Afghanistan.
       Through	 the	1990s	the	ISI	 tried	to	 maintain	its	exclusive	 grip	on	 Pakistan's
Afghan	policy.	 However,	 the	end	of	 the	Cold	 War	deprived	 the	ISI	 of	its	 funds
and	due	to	 Pakistan's	severe	economic	 crisis,	its	 secret	budget	 was	drastically
cut.	More	significantly	  the	ISI's	dwindling	  resources	were	now	directed	towards
another	war	 of	 attrition	  –	this	 one	 for	 the	 hearts	and	minds	 of	 the	 Kashmiri
people	who	had	risen	up	in	revolt	against	India	in	1989.
       During	  Prime	Minister	  Benazir	 Bhutto's	second	term	 of	 office	 (1993-96),
the	retired	 Interior	 Minister	  General	Naseerullah	Babar	 promoted	 the	Taliban.
He	wanted	 to	 free	Afghan	  policy	 from	 the	 ISI.	 Both	 Bhutto	 and	 Babar	were
deeply	suspicious	 of	the	 ISI's	 power	 and	resources,	which	 it	 had	used	to	 fuel
discontent	against	Bhutto	 in	 her	first	 term	 in	 office,	 leading	 to	her	 removal	 in
1990.	Moreover,	the	ISI	 was	initially	  doubtful	 about	the	Taliban's	potential	 as	it
was	still	 wedded	to	backing	 Gulbuddin	Hikmetyar	  and	had	few	funds	 to	back	a
movement	of	 Afghan	 students.	Babar	‘civilianized’	   support	to	 the	Taliban.	 He
created	an	 Afghan	 Trade	 Development	  Cell	 in	  the	 Interior	 Ministry,	   which
ostensibly	 had	the	 task	 of	 co-ordinating	  efforts	 to	 facilitate	  a	trade	 route	 to
Central	Asia-although	 its	principal	 task	was	to	provide	logistical	 backing	 for	the
Taliban,	not	from	secret	funds	but	from	 the	budgets	of	government	ministries.
       Babar	 ordered	Pakistan	Telecommunications	to	 set	up	a	telephone	network

231
for	 the	Taliban,	 which	  became	part	of	 the	 Pakistan	telephone	 grid.	 Kandahar
could	be	dialled	 from	 anywhere	in	 Pakistan	as	a	domestic	 call	using	 the	prefix
081	–	the	same	as	Quetta's	prefix.	Engineers	from	the	Public	 Works	Department
and	the	Water	 and	Power	Development	 Authority	  carried	 out	road	 repairs	and
provided	an	electricity	 supply	to	Kandahar	city.	 The	paramilitary	 Frontier	Corps,
directly	under	the	control	 of	Babar,	helped	the	Taliban	set	up	an	internal	wireless
network	 for	 their	 commanders.	 Pakistan	International	  Airlines	  (PIA)	 and	 the
Civil	 Aviation	  Authority	  sent	in	 technicans	to	repair	 Kandahar	airport	 and	 the
fighter	 jets	and	helicopters	 the	Taliban	 had	 captured.	Radio	 Pakistan	provided
technical	support	to	Radio	Afghanistan,	now	 renamed	Radio	Shariat.
       After	  the	Taliban	capture	of	 Herat	in	 1995,	Pakistani	efforts	 intensified.	 In
January	1996	 the	 Director	  General	 of	 the	 Afghan	  Trade	 Development	 Cell
travelled	by	 road	from	  Quetta	to	Turkmenistan	 accompanied	by	 officials	  from
Civil	 Aviation,	  Pakistan	Telecom,	PIA,	 Pakistan	Railways,	 Radio	 Pakistan	and
the	National	Bank	 of	 Pakistan.	Ministries	 and	government	corporations	took	 on
further	 projects	 to	 help	  the	 Taliban	 with	  budgets	 that	 were	 supposedly	 for
developing	Pakistan's	economy.2
       Despite	 these	efforts	 to	help	 and	control	 the	 Taliban,	 they	were	 nobody's
puppets	and	 they	 resisted	 every	 attempt	 by	 Islamabad	 to	 pull	  their	 strings.
Throughout	Afghan	 history	no	outsider	has	been	able	to	manipulate	the	Afghans,
something	the	British	 and	the	Soviets	 learnt	to	 their	cost.	Pakistan,	it	 appeared,
had	learnt	no	lessons	from	history	 while	 it	 still	 lived	 in	the	past,	when	CIA	 and
Saudi	funding	had	given	 Pakistan	the	power	to	dominate	the	course	of	the	jihad.
Moreover,	 the	  Taliban's	 social,	  economic	  and	 political	  links	  to	  Pakistan's
Pashtun	borderlands	were	immense,	forged	through	two	 decades	of	war	and	life
as	refugees	in	  Pakistan.	The	 Taliban	 were	 born	 in	 Pakistani	 refugee	 camps,
educated	in	Pakistani	madrassasand	learnt	their	fighting	 skills	 from	Mujaheddin
parties	based	in	Pakistan.	Their	families	carried	Pakistani	identity	cards.
       The	  Taliban's	 deep	 connections	 to	 Pakistani	 state	 institutions,	  political
parties,	Islamic	groups,	the	madrassanetwork,	 the	drugs	mafia	and	business	and
transport	groups	came	at	a	time	when	Pakistan's	power	structure	was	unravelling
and	fragmented.	This	 suited	the	 Taliban	 who	 were	not	 beholden	to	 any	single
Pakistani	lobby	 such	as	the	ISI.	 Whereas	in	 the	1980s	Mujaheddin	 leaders	had
exclusive	relationships	 with	 the	ISI	 and	the	 Jamaat-e-Islami,	they	had	 no	links
with	other	 political	 and	economic	 lobbies.	In	 contrast	the	Taliban	had	access	to
more	influential	 lobbies	and	groups	in	Pakistan	than	most	Pakistanis.
       This	  unprecedented	access	 enabled	the	  Taliban	 to	 play	  off	  one	 lobby

232
against	another	and	extend	their	influence	in	Pakistan	even	furthur.	At	times	they
would	defy	the	ISI	 by	enlisting	 the	help	of	government	ministers	 or	the	transport
mafia.	 At	  other	 times	 they	 would	  defy	 the	 federal	  government	 by	 gaining
support	from	 the	provincial	 governments	in	 Baluchistan	and	the	NWFP.	 As	 the
Taliban	 movement	 expanded	it	  became	increasingly	  unclear	 as	to	 who	  was
driving	 whom.	Pakistan,	rather	than	being	the	master	of	the	Taliban,	was	instead
becoming	its	victim.
       Pakistan's	  security	 perceptions	  were	 initially	   shaped	 by	  Afghanistan's
territorial	 claims	 on	parts	of	 the	NWFP	 and	Baluchistan	 and	there	were	border
clashes	between	the	two	states	in	the	1950s	and	1960s.	Afghanistan	insisted	that
Pakistan's	Pashtun	tribal	belt	should	be	allowed	to	opt	either	for	 independence	or
join	Pakistan	 or	Afghanistan.	 Diplomatic	 relations	 were	severed	twice,	 in	1955
and	1962,	as	Kabul	advocated	a	‘Greater	Pashtunistan’,	which	was	supported	by
left-wing	 Pakistani	Pashtuns.	The	Zia	regime	saw	the	Aghan	jihad	 as	a	means	to
end	these	 claims	 for	  ever,	 by	 ensuring	 that	 a	 pliable	  pro-Pakistan	 Pashtun
Mujaheddin	government	came	to	power	in	Kabul.
       Military	   strategists	argued	that	 this	 would	 give	 Pakistan	‘strategic	 depth’
against	its	 primary	 enemy	 India.	 Pakistan's	 elongated	geography,	 the	lack	 of
space,	depth	 and	a	 hinterland	 denied	 its	 armed	 forces	 the	 ability	  to	 fight	 a
prolonged	war	 with	 India.	 In	 the	1990s	an	 addition	 to	this	 was	that	 a	friendly
Afghanistan	 would	 give	 Kashmiri	 militants	  a	base	from	  where	they	 could	 be
trained,	funded	and	armed.
       In	 1992-93,	 under	Indian	 pressure,	the	 USA	 had	come	close	 to	declaring
Pakistan	a	state	sponsor	 of	 terrorism,	 as	Kashmiri	 militants	  based	in	Pakistan
carried	out	 guerrilla	  attacks	in	 Indian	 Kashmir.	  Pakistan	tried	 to	 resolve	 this
problem	 in	 1993	 by	 moving	 many	 of	 the	 Kashmiri	 groups’	  bases	to	eastern
Afghanistan	and	 paying	the	Jalalabad	Shura	and	 later	the	Taliban	 to	 take	them
under	their	protection.	The	government	also	privatized	its	 support	to	the	Kashmir
Mujaheddin,	  by	 making	  Islamic	  parties	  responsible	 for	  their	  training	  and
funding.	Bin	 Laden	 was	encouraged	to	join	 the	Taliban	 in	 1996,	as	he	too	was
sponsoring	bases	for	Kashmiri	militants	in	 Khost.
       Increasingly,	 the	Kashmir	 issue	became	the	prime	mover	 behind	Pakistan's
Afghan	policy	 and	its	support	to	the	Taliban.	The	 Taliban	exploited	this	 adroitly,
refusing	to	 accept	other	Pakistani	demands	knowing	 that	Islamabad	could	 deny
them	 nothing,	 as	 long	  as	 they	 provided	  bases	for	  Kashmiri	  and	 Pakistani
militants.	 ‘We	 support	the	jihad	 in	 Kashmir,’	 said	 Mullah	 Omar	in	 1998.	‘It	  is
also	true	that	some	Afghans	are	fighting	  against	the	Indian	occupation	 forces	in

233
Kashmir.	But	these	Afghans	have	gone	on	their	own,’	 he	added.3
       To	 many,	 the	 concept	of	 ‘strategic	 depth’	 was	 riddled	 with	 fallacies	 and
misconceptions	as	it	 ignored	 obvious	 ground	realities	 that	 political	 stability	  at
home,	 economic	  development,	  wider	  literacy	  and	  friendly	   relations	  with
neighbours	ensured	greater	national	security	than	imaginary	mirages	of	 strategic
depth	in	 the	Afghan	 mountains.	 ‘The	 attainment	of	 strategic	 depth	has	been	a
prime	objective	 of	 Pakistan's	Afghanistan	 policy	 since	 General	Zia	 ul	 Haq.	In
military	 thought	 it	 is	 a	non-concept,	unless	 one	is	referring	  to	a	 hard-to-reach
place	where	 a	 defeated	 army	 might	 safely	 cocoon,’	  wrote	 Pakistani	 scholar
Eqbal	 Ahmad.	 ‘The	 outcome	 is	 a	 country	 caught	 in	 an	 iron	  web	 of	 wrong
assumptions,	 maginotic	  [sic]	  concepts,	 failed	  policies,	   fixed	  postures	 and
sectarian	violence.	Far	from	 improving	 it,	a	Taliban	 victory	 is	likely	 to	 augment
Pakistan's	political	and	strategic	predicament,’	he	added.4
       The	 military	 assumed	that	the	Taliban	 would	 recognize	the	Durand	 Line	–
the	disputed	boundary	line	 between	the	two	countries	created	by	the	British	 and
which	 no	 Afghan	 regime	 has	recognized.	 The	military	  also	 assumed	that	the
Taliban	would	 curb	Pashtun	nationalism	in	 the	NWFP	 and	provide	an	outlet	 for
Pakistan's	Islamic	 radicals,	thus	 forestalling	 an	Islamic	 movement	 at	home.	 In
fact	just	 the	 opposite	 occurred.	The	 Taliban	 refused	to	 recognize	 the	Durand
Line	or	 drop	 Afghanistan's	claims	 to	parts	 of	the	 NWFP.	The	 Taliban	 fostered
Pashtun	nationalism,	  albeit	 of	  an	 Islamic	  character	 and	 it	  began	 to	 affect
Pakistani	Pashtuns.
       Worse	 still,	 the	Taliban	 gave	sanctuary	and	 armed	the	most	violent	  Sunni
extremist	 groups	 in	  Pakistan,	 who	  killed	  Pakistani	 Shias,	 wanted	 Pakistan
declared	a	Sunni	state	and	advocated	the	overthrow	of	the	ruling	elite	through	an
Islamic	 revolution.	  ‘The	  apparent	victor,	  Pakistan,	 could	 pay	  dearly	 for	 its
success.	The	triumph	of	the	Taliban	 has	virtually	 eliminated	 the	border	between
Pakistan	and	Afghanistan.	  On	both	 sides,	Pashtun	 tribes	are	 slipping	 towards
fundamentalism	and	becoming	increasingly	 implicated	 in	drug	 trafficking.	 They
are	gaining	autonomy,	already	small	fundamentalist	tribal	 emirates	are	appearing
on	 Pakistani	 soil.	  The	 de	 facto	  absorption	 of	  Afghanistan	  will	  accentuate
centrifugal	 tendencies	within	 Pakistan,’	predicted	 Olivier	 Roy	 in	 1997.5	In	fact
the	backwash	from	Afghanistan	 was	leading	to	 the	‘Talibanization’	  of	 Pakistan.
The	Taliban	 were	 not	providing	  strategic	 depth	to	 Pakistan,	but	 Pakistan	was
providing	strategic	depth	to	the	Taliban.
       Pakistan	 became	a	victim	  not	 only	 of	 its	 strategic	vision,	 but	 of	 its	 own
intelligence	agencies.	The	ISI's	micro-management	of	the	Afghan	 jihad	was	only

234
possible	because	under	a	military	 regime	and	 with	 lavish	funding	 from	 abroad,
the	ISI	was	able	to	 subdue	political	 opposition	at	 home.	Zia	and	the	ISI	 had	the
power	to	formulate	 Afghan	 policy	 and	implement	 it,	 something	which	 no	other
intelligence	 agency,	not	even	the	 CIA,	 had	the	 power	to	 do.	This	 gave	the	ISI
enormous	unity	 of	  purpose	and	 scope	for	 operations.	 The	 ISI	 then	 faced	no
independent	powerful	lobbies	or	 political	 rivals,	as	in	the	Taliban	 era,	when	they
had	 to	  compete	 with	  an	  array	 of	  Pakistani	  lobbies	  which	  independently
supported	the	Taliban	and	had	their	own	agendas.
       By	  running	 both	Afghan	 policy	  and	operations,	 the	ISI	 had	 no	room	 for
critical	  reappraisals,	 accommodating	  dissent	 from	  the	 status	 quo,	  nor	  the
imagination	 or	flexibility	   to	adapt	to	 changing	situations	and	 the	ever-evolving
geo-political	 environment.	  The	 ISI	 became	a	 victim	  of	 its	  own	 rigidity	  and
inflexibility,	   even	as	its	 power	 to	 actually	 control	 the	 Taliban	 dwindled.	 The
agency's	operatives	in	Afghanistan	 were	all	 Pashtun	officers,	 while	 many	 were
also	motivated	by	 strong	Islamic	fundamentalist	 leanings.	Working	 closely	 with
Hikmetyar	 and	later	the	 Taliban,	this	 Pashtun	cadre	developed	its	own	 agenda,
aimed	at	 furthering	  Pashtun	 power	 and	 radical	 Islam	 in	  Afghanistan	 at	 the
expense	of	the	ethnic	minorities	and	moderate	Islam.
       In	 the	words	of	 one	retired	ISI	officer,	 ‘these	officers	 became	more	Taliban
than	the	Taliban.’	  Consequently	their	 analysis	of	 the	 anti-Taliban	 alliance	 and
pipeline	politics	  became	deeply	flawed,	 riddled	 with	 rigidity,	  cliches	and	 false
assumptions	 which	  were	 driven	  more	  by	  their	 strong	  Islamic	  ideological
assumptions	than	by	objective	facts.	But	by	now	the	ISI	 was	too	powerful	for	 the
government	of	the	day	to	question	and	too	intrusive	for	 any	army	chief	of	staff	 to
clean	up.
       When	  the	 Taliban	  emerged	the	  ISI	 was	 initially	   sceptical	  about	 their
chances.	It	  was	 a	 period	 when	 the	 ISI	  was	 in	 retreat,	 with	  the	 failure	  of
Hikmetyar	 to	 capture	Kabul	 and	a	 shortage	of	funds.	 The	 ISI	 retreat	gave	the
Bhutto	government	the	opportunity	 to	devise	their	 own	support	for	 the	Taliban.6
During	1995	the	ISI	 continued	to	debate	the	issue	of	support	for	the	Taliban.	The
debate	centred	around	the	Pashtun-Islamic	field	officers	inside	Afghanistan,	 who
advocated	greater	support	for	 the	 Taliban	 and	those	officers	 involved	 in	 long-
term	strategic	planning,	who	 wished	to	keep	Pakistan's	support	to	a	minimum	 so
as	not	to	worsen	 relations	with	 Central	Asia	 and	Iran.	 By	 the	summer	of	 1995,
the	Pashtun	network	 in	 the	army	 and	 the	ISI	 determined	 to	back	 the	Taliban,
especially	 as	President	 Burhanuddin	 Rabbani	 sought	support	 from	  Pakistan's
rivals	-Russia,	Iran	and	India.7

235
       But	 by	 now	the	ISI	 faced	all	 the	other	Pakistani	 lobbies	which	 the	Taliban
were	plugged	into,	 from	 radical	mullahs	 to	drug	barons.	The	 fierce	competition
between	the	 ISI,	  the	government	 and	 these	 lobbies	 only	 further	  fragmented
Islamabad's	 decision-making	   process	  on	  Afghanistan.	   Pakistan's	  Foreign
Ministry	 was	so	weakened	by	this	confusion	that	it	became	virtually	 irrelevant	 to
Afghan	policy	  and	unable	to	 counter	the	worsening	 diplomatic	 environment	 as
every	neighbour	–	Russia,	Iran,	 the	Central	Asian	states	–	accused	Islamabad	of
destabilizing	 the	region.	 Efforts	 to	 defuse	the	 criticism	 such	 as	secret	trips	 to
Moscow,	 Tehran,	Tashkent	 and	Ashkhabad	by	 successive	ISI	 chiefs	 proved	 a
failure.
       As	  international	  criticism	   increased,	 the	 newly	  elected	  Nawaz	 Sharif
government	and	the	ISI	 became	more	adamant	in	 backing	 the	Taliban.	 In	May
1997	 when	 the	 Taliban	  tried	 to	  capture	Mazar,	  the	 ISI	  calculated	 that	 by
recognizing	the	 Taliban	 government,	it	 would	 force	 hostile	 neighbours	to	 deal
with	the	Taliban	 and	need	Islamabad	to	improve	their	own	relationships	 with	the
Taliban.	 It	  was	  a	 high	  stakes	gamble	  that	 badly	  misfired	  when	  Pakistan
prematurely	recognized	the	Taliban,	who	were	then	driven	out	of	 Mazar.8
       Pakistan	 reacted	by	lashing	 out	 at	its	 critics	 including	 the	UN	 which	 was
now	 openly	 critical	 of	 all	  external	 support	for	  the	Afghan	  factions.	 Pakistan
accused	UN	 Secretary	 General	Kofi	  Annan	  of	 being	 partisan.	 ‘The	 UN	  has
gradually	marginalized	 itself	 in	 Afghanistan	 and	lost	credibility	  as	an	impartial
mediator,’	 said	 Ahmad	 Kamal,	 Pakistan's	Ambassador	 to	 the	 UN	 in	 January
1998.	Later	Kamal	told	a	conference	of	Pakistani	envoys	in	Islamabad	that	it	 was
not	Pakistan	which	 was	 isolated	in	 Afghanistan,	 but	 that	the	 rest	of	 the	world
was	isolated	 from	 Pakistan	and	 they	would	  have	to	 come	round	 to	 accepting
Pakistan's	position	on	the	Taliban.9
       As	  Pakistan	advocated	 the	Taliban's	 policies	  in	 the	teeth	 of	 widespread
international	criticism,	  the	government	lost	 sight	of	 how	 much	the	country	 was
losing.	  The	 smuggling	  trade	  to	  and	 from	  Afghanistan	  became	  the	 most
devastating	manifestation	 of	 these	losses.	This	 trade,	which	 now	 extends	 into
Central	Asia,	Iran	and	the	Persian	Gulf	 represents	a	crippling	loss	of	revenue	for
all	 these	 countries	 but	 particularly	  Pakistan,	 where	 local	 industry	  has	 been
decimated	by	the	smuggling	of	foreign	 consumer	goods.	What	is	euphemistically
called	the	Afghan	Transit	 Trade	(ATT)	 has	become	the	biggest	smuggling	racket
in	  the	 world	   and	  has	 enmeshed	 the	  Taliban	  with	   Pakistani	  smugglers,
transporters,	drug	barons,	bureaucrats,	politicans	 and	police	 and	army	 officers.
This	trade	became	the	main	source	of	official	  income	for	 the	Taliban,	even	as	it

236
undermined	the	economies	of	neighbouring	states.
       The	 border	post	between	Chaman	in	Baluchistan	province	 and	Spin	Baldak
in	Afghanistan	 is	 a	prime	location	 for	 watching	 the	racket	 at	work.	 On	a	 good
day,	some	300	 trucks	 pass	through.	Truck	 drivers,	 Pakistani	 customs	officials
and	Taliban	mix	 in	a	casual,	friendly	 way	guzzling	 down	 endless	cups	of	tea,	as
long	lines	 of	trucks	 wait	to	 cross.	Everybody	 seems	to	know	everybody	 else	as
drivers	tell	 stories	which	would	 make	the	World	 Trade	Organisation's	hair	 stand
on	end.	Many	of	the	huge	Mercedes	and	Bedford	trucks	are	stolen	and	have	false
number	plates.	The	goods	they	carry	have	no	invoices.	The	drivers	may	 cross	up
to	six	international	 frontiers	 on	false	 driving	 licenses	and	without	 route	permits
or	 passports.	The	 consignments	 range	from	  Japanese	camcorders	to	 English
underwear	and	Earl	Grey	tea,	Chinese	silk	 to	American	 computer	parts,	Afghan
heroin	 to	 Pakistani	 wheat	and	 sugar,	 East	European	 kalashnikovs	 to	 Iranian
petroleum	–	and	nobody	pays	customs	duties	or	sales	tax.
       This	 Wild	 West	of	 free	trade	expanded	due	to	the	civil	 war	in	 Afghanistan,
the	drugs	 business	and	 the	collapse	 and	 corruption	 of	 Pakistani,	 Iranian	 and
Central	 Asian	   state	 institutions	  along	  their	  borders	  with	   Afghanistan.	  It
coincided	with	  a	hunger	 for	 consumer	goods	throughout	 the	 region.	 Pakistani
and	Afghan,	transport	and	drugs	mafias	merged	to	fuel	this	need.	‘It's	completely
out	of	 control,’	  an	official	  of	 Pakistan's	Central	Board	 of	 Revenue	told	 me	as
early	as	 1995.	‘The	 Taliban	 are	 funded	 by	transporters	 to	open	 the	roads	 for
smuggling	  and	 this	  mafia	  is	  now	  making	  and	 breaking	  governments	  in
Afghanistan	 and	 in	  Pakistan.	 Pakistan	 will	   face	 a	 30-per-cent	  shortfall	  in
revenues	this	year,	because	of	customs	duties	lost	to	the	ATT,’	he	said.10
       Trade	 has	always	 been	 critical	 to	 the	 Islamic	 heartland.	 The	 Silk	 Route
which	linked	 China	 to	Europe	in	 the	Middle	 Ages	 passed	through	Central	Asia
and	Afghanistan	 and	was	run	 by	 the	same	tribesmen	and	 nomads	who	are	 the
truck-drivers	of	 today.	The	Silk	 Route	influenced	 Europe	almost	as	much	as	the
Arab	conquests,	for	these	caravans	transported	not	just	 luxury	 goods,	but	ideas,
religion,	new	 weapons	and	scientific	discoveries.	A	 camel	caravan	might	consist
of	five	 or	six	 thousands	camels,	‘its	total	 capacity	equalling	 that	of	 a	very	large
merchant	sailing	ship.	A	 caravan	travelled	like	 an	army,	with	 a	leader,	a	general
staff,	 strict	 rules,	 compulsory	  staging	 posts,	and	 routine	  precautions	against
marauding	nomads,’	wrote	 French	historian	 Fernand	Braudel.11	Little	 seems	to
have	changed	in	 nearly	2,000	 years.	Today's	smugglers	 operate	with	 a	similar
military	 type	infrastructure	even	though	trucks	have	replaced	camels.
       In	   1950,	  under	  international	  agreements,	 Pakistan	  gave	  land-locked

237
Afghanistan	permission	 to	 import	 duty-free	 goods	through	 the	port	 of	 Karachi
according	to	 an	ATT	  agreement.	Truckers	would	  drive	their	 sealed	containers
from	 Karachi,	cross	 into	Afghanistan,	 sell	 some	goods	in	 Kabul	 and	then	 turn
around	to	 resell	the	 rest	in	 Pakistani	markets.	 It	 was	a	 flourishing	 but	 limited
business	giving	 Pakistanis	access	to	cheap,	duty-free	 foreign	 consumer	 goods,
particularly	 Japanese	electronics.	 The	ATT	  expanded	in	  the	1980s,	 servicing
Afghanistan's	communist-controlled	 cities.	 The	fall	 of	 Kabul	 in	 1992	coincided
with	 new	markets	opening	 up	in	 Central	Asia	 and	the	need	for	 foodstuffs,	 fuel
and	building	 materials	as	Afghan	 refugees	returned	home	–	a	potential	 bonanza
for	the	transport	mafias.
       However,	  the	 transporters	 were	  frustrated	 with	  the	 civil	   war	 and	  the
warlords	who	 taxed	their	trucks	 dozens	of	times	 along	a	single	route.	 Although
the	Peshawar-based	transport	 mafia	 were	 trading	 between	 Pakistan,	northern
Afghanistan	 and	 Uzbekistan,	 despite	 the	 continuing	  war	 around	 Kabul,	  the
Quetta-based	mafia	were	at	 a	loss	with	 the	 rapacious,	Kandahar	warlords	 who
had	set	up	dozens	of	toll	  chains	along	the	highway	 from	 Pakistan.	The	Quetta-
based	 transport	  mafia	  were	  keen	  to	  open	 up	  safe	  routes	  to	  Iran	  and
Turkmenistan,	just	as	the	Bhutto	government	were	advocating	a	similar	policy.
       Taliban	 leaders	were	well	connected	to	the	Quetta	mafia,	who	were	the	first
to	provide	financial	 support	to	the	Taliban	 movement.	Initially,	  the	Quetta	mafia
gave	the	Taliban	a	monthly	retainer	 but	as	the	Taliban	expanded	westwards	they
demanded	more	funds.	 In	 Apil	  1995,	witnesses	I	 spoke	 to	 in	 Quetta	said	 the
Taliban	collected	6	million	 rupees	(US$130,000)	from	 transporters	in	Chaman	in
a	single	day	and	twice	 that	 amount	the	next	day	 in	Quetta	 as	they	prepared	for
their	first	 attack	on	Herat.	These	‘donations’	were	quite	apart	from	 the	single	all-
inclusive	  customs	  duty	   the	  Taliban	   now	  charged	  trucks	  crossing	  into
Afghanistan	from	 Pakistan,	which	 became	the	Taliban's	 main	source	of	 official
income.
       With	  routes	 now	  safe	 and	 secure,	the	 volume	  and	 area	of	  smuggling
expanded	dramatically.	From	 Quetta,	truck	convoys	 travelled	to	 Kandahar,	then
southwards	to	Iran,	westwards	to	Turkmenistan	and	to	other	CARs,	 even	Russia.
Soon	the	 Quetta	transport	 mafia	 were	urging	  the	Taliban	 to	 capture	 Herat	in
order	to	 take	full	  control	 of	 the	road	 to	 Turkmenistan.12	Even	though	 the	ISI
initially	  advised	 the	Taliban	 not	 to	 attack	 Herat,	 the	 Quetta	mafia	 had	 more
influence	with	 the	 Taliban.	In	 1996,	the	 transporters	urged	the	Taliban	 to	clear
the	route	north	 by	capturing	 Kabul.	 After	 taking	 the	capital,	 the	Taliban	 levied
an	average	of	 6000	 rupees	(US$150)	 for	 a	truck	 travelling	  from	 Peshawar	to

238
Kabul,	 compared	 to	 30,000-50,000	 rupees,	 which	 truckers	 paid	 before.	 The
transport	mafia	 gave	Taliban	 leaders	a	 stake	in	 their	 business	by	 encouraging
them	to	buy	 trucks	or	arranging	 for	 their	relatives	 to	do	so.	And	 with	 the	drugs
mafia	 now	 willing	   to	 pay	 a	 zakat(tax)	 to	 transport	 heroin,	 the	 transit	 trade
became	even	more	crucial	to	the	Taliban	exchequer.
       Pakistan	was	 the	most	damaged	victim	 of	 this	trade.	The	Central	 Board	of
Revenue	(CBR)	estimated	that	 Pakistan	lost	3.5	 billion	 rupees	(US$80	million)
in	customs	revenue	in	the	financial	 year	1992/3,	 11	billion	 rupees	in	 1993/4,	20
billion	 rupees	during	1994/5	and	30	billion	 rupees	(US$600	million)	  in	1997/8	–
a	staggering	 increase	every	 year	 that	reflected	 the	 Taliban's	 expansion.13	An
enormous	nexus	 of	 corruption	 emerged	in	  Pakistan	due	 to	 the	ATT.	  All	  the
Pakistani	agencies	involved	were	taking	bribes	–	Customs,	Customs	Intelligence,
CBR,	 the	  Frontier	  Constabulary	 and	 the	  administrators	 in	  the	  tribal	  belt.
Lucrative	 customs	jobs	on	the	Afghan	 border	 were	‘bought’	  by	applicants	who
paid	bribes	to	senior	bureaucrats	to	get	 the	posting.	These	bribes,	considered	an
investment,	were	then	made	up	 by	the	 newly	 appointed	officials	 who	 extracted
bribes	from	the	ATT.
       This	 nexus	extended	to	politicans	 and	cabinet	ministers	 in	Baluchistan	 and
the	NWFP.	The	chief	 ministers	and	governors	of	 the	two	 provinces	issued	route
permits	for	trucks	 to	operate	and	wheat	and	sugar	permits	for	the	export	of	these
commodities	to	Afghanistan.	 Senior	army	officers	complained	 to	me	in	1995	and
again	in	1996,	that	the	competition	 between	the	chief	ministers	and	governors	of
the	two	 provinces	 in	 issuing	 route	 permits	 was	a	 major	 source	of	 corruption
paralyzing	 the	 entire	 administrative	 machinery,	 interfering	  and	often	  at	odds
with	 the	ISI's	 policy	 on	Afghanistan	 and	creating	 widespread	Taliban	 ‘control’
over	Pakistani	politicans.
       As	  the	mafia	  extended	their	 trade,	 they	 also	 stripped	 Afghanistan	 bare.
They	 cut	 down	 millions	  of	 acres	of	 timber	  in	 Afghanistan	 for	 the	 Pakistani
market,	denuding	 the	countryside	 as	there	was	 no	reforestation.	 They	 stripped
down	rusting	 factories,	 destroyed	 tanks	and	 vehicles	 and	even	electricity	  and
telephone	poles	for	 their	steel	 and	sold	the	scrap	to	 steel	mills	 in	 Lahore.	 Car-
jacking	 in	Karachi	 and	other	 cities	 flourished	 as	the	mafia	 organized	local	 car
thieves	to	steal	vehicles	and	then	shifted	 the	vehicles	to	Afghanistan.	 The	mafia
then	resold	 them	 to	 clients	 in	 Afghanistan	 and	 Pakistan.	Sixty-five	  thousand
vehicles	were	stolen	from	Karachi	 alone	in	1992-98	 with	the	majority	 ending	 up
in	Afghanistan,	only	 to	reappear	in	Pakistan	with	their	number	plates	changed.14
       The	 transport	mafia	also	smuggled	in	electronic	 goods	from	Dubai,	 Sharjah

239
and	other	Persian	Gulf	ports	while	 exporting	heroin	 hidden	in	Afghan	 dried	fruit
and	seasoned	timber	–	on	Ariana,	the	national	 Afghan	airline	 now	controlled	 by
the	Taliban.	Flights	from	 Kandahar,	Kabul	and	Jalalabad	took	off	 directly	for	 the
Gulf,	 moving	 the	Taliban	 into	 the	 jet	 age	and	giving	  Silk	 Route	smuggling	 a
modern	commercial	edge.
       The	  ATT	   fuelled	  the	  already	 powerful	   black	  economy	  in	  Pakistan.
According	 to	 an	 academic	 study,	 the	underground	 economy	 in	 Pakistan	 has
snowballed	from	 15	billion	 rupees	in	1973	 to	1,115	billion	 rupees	in	 1996,	with
its	share	in	 GDP	increasing	from	 20	 per	cent	to	 51	per	cent.15During	the	same
period,	tax	 evasion	 –	 including	 customs	 duty	 evasion-has	escalated	from	 1.5
billion	 to	152	billion	  rupees,	accelerating	at	a	rate	of	88	 billion	 rupees	per	year.
The	smuggling	 trade	 contributed	 some	100	 billion	  rupees	to	 the	underground
economy	in	1993,	 which	had	escalated	to	over	 300	billion	 rupees	in	1998.	 That
is	equivalent	 to	30	 per	cent	 of	 the	country's	 total	 imports	of	 US$10	 billion	  or
equal	to	the	 entire	revenue	collection	 target	for	 1998/9	 (300	billion	  rupees).	In
addition,	 the	Afghanistan-Pakistan	  drugs	trade	 was	estimated	 to	 be	worth	  an
annual	50	billion	rupees.
       In	  the	 NWFP,	 smugglers	 markets	 or	 baraswere	 flooded	  with	 imported
consumer	goods	causing	massive	losses	to	 Pakistani	industry.	 For	 example,	in
1994	Pakistan,	which	  manufactured	its	 own	 air-conditioners,	 imported	 just	 30
million	  rupees’	worth	 of	  foreign	 air-conditoners.	 Afghanistan,	 a	 country	 then
totally	bereft	 of	electricity,	 imported	 through	the	ATT	 1	billion	  rupees’	worth	of
air-conditioners,	 which	  all	 ended	up	 in	  Pakistani	 baras,	 thus	crippling	  local
manufacturers.	When	duty-free	 Japanese	TV	sets	or	dishwashers	were	available
at	virtually	  the	 same	price	 as	Pakistani	 manufactured	ones,	consumers	would
naturally	buy	Japanese	products.	The	bara	at	Hayatabad	outside	Peshawar	set	up
brand-name	shops	to	attract	customers	such	as	Britain's	Marks	 and	Spencer	and
Mothercare,	and	Japan's	Sony	where	the	original	  products	were	available	 duty-
free.	‘The	ATT	 has	destroyed	economic	activity	 in	the	province	 and	people	have
give	up	the	 idea	of	 honest	earnings	and	consider	smuggling	 as	their	due	right,’
said	NWFP	Chief	Minister	 Mahtab	Ahmed	 Khan	in	December	1998.16
       A	  similar	  undermining	 of	 the	 economy	 and	 widespread	 corruption	 was
taking	place	 in	 Iran.	 The	transport	 mafia's	smuggling	 of	 fuel	 and	 other	goods
from	 Iran	 to	 Afghanistan	  and	Pakistan	 led	 to	 revenue	 losses,	crippled	 local
industry	 and	 corrupted	  people	 at	 the	 highest	 level	  of	  government.	 Iranian
officials	 privately	  admitted	to	 me	 that	the	 Bunyads	 or	the	 state-run	industrial
foundations	as	well	 as	the	Revolutionary	  Guards	were	among	the	 beneficiaries

240
from	 the	smuggling	 of	 petroleum	 products,	 whose	sale	in	 Afghanistan	 earned
2,000-3,000-per-cent	 profit	  compared	 to	  Iran.	  Fuel	 was	 devoured	  in	 huge
quantities	by	 the	war	 machines	of	 the	Afghan	 warlords	 and	 soon	petrol	 pump
owners	in	 Baluchistan	 were	ordering	 cheap	fuel	 from	  Iran	through	 the	 mafia,
bypassing	Pakistani	companies	(and	customs	duties)	altogether.
       Pakistan	made	several	half-hearted	attempts	to	rein	 in	the	ATT	 by	 stopping
the	import	of	 items	such	as	electronics,	but	the	government	always	backed	down
as	the	Taliban	refused	to	comply	 with	 the	new	orders	and	the	mafia	 pressurized
government	ministers.	 There	were	no	lobbies	 in	 Islamabad	willing	  to	point	 out
the	damage	being	 inflicted	  upon	Pakistan's	economy	 or	 prepared	to	 force	 the
Taliban	 to	 comply.	 The	 ISI	  was	 unwilling	  to	 use	 the	 threat	of	  withholding
support	to	the	Taliban	 until	 they	complied.	 To	bewildered	 foreign	and	Pakistani
investors	 the	  government	  appeared	 willing	   to	  undermine	  Pakistan's	 own
economy	for	  the	sake	 of	 the	Taliban,	  as	Islamabad	 was	allowing	  a	de	 facto
transfer	of	 revenues	from	  the	Pakistan	state	 to	 the	Taliban.	 It	 was	 a	form	  of
unofficial	 aid,	 which	benefited	 the	Taliban	 and	made	those	Pakistanis	involved
extremely	 rich.	 They	 created	the	 most	 powerful	 lobby	 to	 continue	 Pakistan's
support	to	the	Taliban.
       The	  backlash	 from	   Afghanistan	  added	 fuel	  to	  the	 spreading	 fire	   of
instability	 in	  Pakistan.	In	 the	 1980s	 the	fall-out	  from	 the	 Soviet	 invasion	 of
Afghanistan	 had	created	‘the	 heroin	 and	kalashnikov	 culture’	 that	 undermined
Pakistan's	politics	and	economy.	‘Ten	years	of	 active	involvement	 in	the	Afghan
war	 has	changed	 the	 social	 profile	  of	  Pakistan	 to	 such	 an	extent	  that	 any
government	faces	serious	problems	in	effective	 governance.	Pakistani	society	 is
now	 more	fractured,	 inundated	 with	 sophisticated	 weapons,	brutalized	 due	 to
growing	 civic	  violence	 and	 overwhelmed	 by	 the	 spread	of	 narcotics,’	  wrote
American	historian	Paul	Kennedy.17
       In	 the	late	1990s	the	repercussions	were	much	more	pervasive,	undermining
all	the	 institutions	 of	 the	 state.	Pakistan's	economy	was	 being	crippled	 by	 the
ATT,	its	 foreign	policy	 faced	isolation	from	 the	West	and	immediate	neighbours,
law	and	order	broke	down	as	Islamic	militants	 enacted	their	own	laws	 and	a	new
breed	of	 anti-Shia	Islamic	 radicals,	 who	 were	given	 sanctuary	by	 the	Taliban,
killed	  hundreds	of	  Pakistani	 Shias	 between	 1996	 and	 1999.	 This	  sectarian
bloodshed	is	now	 fuelling	 a	much	 wider	rift	  between	Pakistan's	Sunni	majority
and	Shia	minority	and	undermining	 relations	between	Pakistan	and	Iran.18	At	the
same	time	over	80,000	Pakistani	 Islamic	militants	 have	trained	 and	fought	 with
the	Taliban	since	1994.	They	 form	 a	hardcore	of	Islamic	 activists,	ever	ready	to

241
carry	out	a	similar	Taliban-style	 Islamic	revolution	 in	Pakistan.19
       Tribal	 groups	imitating	 the	Taliban	 sprang	up	across	the	Pashtun	belt	in	the
NWFP	and	Baluchistan.	As	 early	as	1995	Maulana	Sufi	 Mohammed	had	led	 his
Tanzim	Nifaz	 Shariat-i-Mohammedi	 in	Bajaur	 Agency	in	 an	uprising	to	demand
Sharia	law.	The	revolt	 was	joined	 by	hundreds	of	Afghan	 and	Pakistani	Taliban
before	it	 was	crushed	by	 the	 army.	The	 Tanzim	 leaders	then	sought	 refuge	in
Afghanistan	 with	   the	 Taliban.	  In	  December	 1998,	  the	 Tehrik-i-Tuleba	   or
Movement	 of	Taliban	 in	 the	 Orakzai	Agency	 publicly	  executed	a	murderer	 in
front	 of	 2,000	 spectators	in	 defiance	 of	 the	 legal	 process.	They	 promised	 to
implement	 Taliban-style	 justice	 throughout	 the	 Pashtun	belt	 and	 banned	TV,
music	 and	 videos	 in	 imitation	  of	  the	 Taliban.20	Other	  pro-Taliban	 Pashtun
groups	sprang	up	in	Quetta	–	they	burned	down	 cinema	houses,	shot	video	shop
owners,	smashed	satellite	dishes	and	drove	women	off	the	streets.
       Yet	 after	 the	 Taliban	 captured	Mazar	 in	 1998,	Pakistan	 declared	victory,
demanding	that	the	world	 recognize	the	movement	which	now	 controlled	 80	per
cent	of	 Afghanistan.	  Pakistan's	military	  and	 civilian	  leaders	insisted	 that	 the
Taliban's	 success	was	Pakistan's	success	and	 that	 its	 policy	 was	 correct	 and
unchangeable.	Pakistan	considered	Iranian	influence	 in	 Afghanistan	 to	be	 over
and	that	Russia	and	the	Central	 Asian	 states	would	be	obliged	 to	deal	 with	 the
Taliban	through	 Islamabad	while	 the	West	 would	 have	no	choice	but	 to	accept
the	Taliban's	interpretation	of	Islam.
       Even	though	 there	was	mounting	public	concern	about	the	Talibanization	 of
Pakistan,	the	 country's	 leaders	ignored	 the	 growing	 internal	  chaos.	Outsiders
increasingly	saw	Pakistan	as	a	failing	 or	 failed	 state	like	Afghanistan,	 Sudan	or
Somalia.	A	 failed	 state	is	not	 necessarily	a	dying	 state,	although	 it	can	 be	that
too.	A	failed	 state	is	one	in	which	the	repeated	failure	of	policies	 carried	out	by	a
bankrupt	political	 elite	 is	never	considered	sufficient	 reason	to	reconsider	them.
Pakistan's	elite	  showed	 no	 inclination	  to	 change	 its	 policy	  in	  Afghanistan.
General	Zia	had	dreamed	like	 a	Mogul	  emperor	of	 ‘recreating	a	 Sunni	Muslim
space	between	infidel	“Hindustan”,	 “heretic”	 [because	Shia]	Iran	and	“Christian”
Russia’.21	He	believed	that	the	message	of	the	Afghan	Mujaheddin	would	spread
into	Central	 Asia,	 revive	Islam	 and	create	a	new	 Pakistan-led	Islamic	 block	 of
nations.	What	Zia	never	considered	was	what	his	legacy	would	do	to	Pakistan.

There	was	a	sense	of	change	and	renewal	in	Tehran	in	the	spring	of	1999.	For
nearly	20	years	since	the	Islamic	 revolution,	Tehran's	women	had	shrouded
themselves	in	the	dictated	garb	of	hijab	-the	uniform	black	tents.	Now	suddenly
the	hijabwas	sprouting	faux-leopard-skin	trimmings	and	fur.	Some	women	were
wearing	raincoats	or	donning	the	hijablike	a	cape	revealing	short	skirts,	tight
jeans,	black	silk	stockings	and	high	heels.	Rather	than	an	imposed	dress	code,
female	modesty	now	appeared	to	be	up	to	the	individual.	The	loosening	up	of	the
hijabwas	only	one	sign	of	the	transformation	of	Iranian	society	after	the	election
of	Sayed	Mohammed	Khatami	to	the	Presidency	in	May	1997,	when	he	took	70
per	cent	of	 the	 popular	vote	in	 a	 stunning	victory	 against	a	more	hardline
conservative	candidate.	Khatami	had	garnered	the	votes	of	the	youth,	who	were
fed	up	with	25-per-cent	unemployment	and	high	inflation	and	hopeful	that	he
would	usher	in	economic	development	and	a	more	open	society.
       Khatami's	victory	created	an	immediate	thaw	in	Iran's	relations	with	the
outside	world	as	it	opened	up	to	the	West,	wooed	its	old	enemy	the	USA	with
the	need	for	“a	dialogue	between	civilizations’	and	sought	an	improvement	in
relations	with	the	Arab	world.	Afghanistan	was	to	become	the	primary	issue	in
helping	thaw	relations	between	Iran,	the	USA	and	the	Arab	world.	During	his
visit	 to	Kabul	 in	 April	  1998,	US	 Ambassador	Bill	Richardson	had	already
signalled	that	the	USA	saw	Iran	as	a	dialogue	partner	to	help	resolve	the	Afghan
crisis.	Iran	was	also	talking	to	an	old	foe,	Saudi	Arabia.
       ‘The	positive	climate	between	Iran	and	Saudi	Arabia	is	encouraging	and
both	 sides	are	 ready	 to	 co-operate	for	 the	 resolution	 of	  the	 conflict	 in
Afghanistan,’	Iran's	new	Foreign	Minister	Kamal	Kharrazi	said	in	May	1998.1	A
suave,	English-speaking	diplomat	who	for	11	years	had	represented	Iran	at	the
UN,	 Kharrazi's	soft	 diplomatic	 manner	and	style	 were	 representative	of	a
revolution	that	had	mellowed.
       Iran's	new	leaders	were	deeply	antagonistic	to	the	Taliban,	but	they	were

244
pragmatic	 enough	 to	  realize	 that	  peace	in	  Afghanistan	  was	 necessary	 for
economic	 development	 and	 political	  liberalization	  in	  Iran.	 Stability	  in	 their
neighbourhood	would	also	help	 Iran	end	its	international	 isolation.	 Khatami	was
far	from	 looking	 for	 a	fight	 with	the	 Taliban,	yet	 just	six	months	 later,	after	the
Taliban	killed	 nine	Iranian	diplomats	 in	Mazar,	Iran	 had	mobilized	a	quarter	of	a
million	 soldiers	 on	its	 border	with	  Afghanistan	 and	was	threatening	to	 invade.
As	tensions	with	  the	Taliban	 escalated,	the	new	relationship	 between	 Iran	and
Saudi	Arabia	took	on	even	more	importance.
       Afghanistan	 has	been	just	one	area	of	conflict	in	the	intense	rivalry	 between
the	Persians	and	the	Arabs.	Both	peoples	have	conquered	and	ruled	one	another
against	a	background	of	dispute	between	Sunni	Arabia	 and	Shia	Persia.	In	1501
Shah	Ismail	of	 the	Safavid	dynasty	 turned	Iran	into	 the	first	 and	only	 Shia	state
in	the	 Islamic	 world.	 Both	 the	 Persians	and	the	Arabs	 had	ruled	 over	 Central
Asia	and	 Afghanistan,	 although	Persian	 rule	and	 its	culture	 and	language	 was
much	more	long-standing	and	left	a	permanent	mark.
       In	 the	twentieth	 century	 the	long	 war	between	revolutionary	  Iran	and	Iraq
(1981-88),	which	 led	 to	some	1.5	million	  casualties,	only	 deepened	this	rivalry
as	all	the	Arab	 states	had	supported	Saddam	Hussein's	Iraq.	As	that	war	 began,
another	was	 just	 beginning	 in	 Afghanistan	 and	here	 too	 the	age-old	 rivalries
would	 continue	–	 this	time	 in	 the	context	 of	 the	Cold	 War	 and	the	US	 aim	to
isolate	Iran	with	the	help	of	 the	Arab	states.
       Ostensibly	 both	Iran	and	Saudi	Arabia	 were	on	the	same	side	in	the	Afghan
conflict.	 They	 strongly	 opposed	the	Soviet	 invasion	 of	 Afghanistan,	 supported
the	Mujaheddin	and	backed	international	 measures	to	isolate	the	Afghan	 regime
and	the	Soviet	Union.	 But	 they	supported	opposing	 factions	of	 the	Mujaheddin
and	Iran	never	severed	its	diplomatic	links	 with	 the	Kabul	regime.	Saudi	support
to	the	Mujaheddin	 was	 in	line	 with	 the	US	 and	Pakistani	strategy	 of	providing
the	bulk	 of	 funds	 and	weapons	to	 the	most	 radical	 Sunni	Pashtun	groups	 and
ignoring	 the	 Shia	 Afghans.	 The	 Saudis	also	 separately	funded	 Afghans	 who
promoted	Wahabbism.
       Dollar	  for	dollar,	 Saudi	aid	matched	the	 funds	given	to	 the	Mujaheddin	 by
the	US.	The	 Saudis	gave	nearly	US$4	 billion	 in	 official	  aid	to	 the	Mujaheddin
between	1980	 and	 1990,	 which	 did	  not	 include	 unofficial	  aid	  from	 Islamic
charities,	 foundations,	 the	private	  funds	 of	 Princes	 and	mosque	 collections.2
There	were	also	direct	funds	given	to	the	ISI,	as	in	1989	when	the	Saudis	handed
over	US$26	 million	  dollars	to	 bribe	 Afghan	 leaders	during	 the	negotiations	 to
form	  the	  Mujaheddin	   interim	   government	  in	  exile	   in	  Islamabad.3	  The

245
Mujaheddin	 leaders	 were	obliged	  to	 appoint	 an	Afghan	  Wahabbi	 as	 interim
Prime	Minister.
       In	 March	 1990,	the	Saudis	came	up	with	 an	additional	 US$100	million	  for
Hikmetyar's	 Hizb-e-Islami	  party	 who	 were	 backing	 an	abortive	 coup	 attempt
from	 within	 the	 Afghan	 army	 against	President	 Najibullah	 by	 Hikmetyar	  and
General	Shahnawaz	Tanai	in	Kabul.4	After	1992	the	Saudis	continued	to	provide
funds	and	 fuel	 to	 the	 Mujaheddin	 government	 in	 Kabul.	  The	fuel,	  chanelled
through	 Pakistan,	 became	 a	 major	 source	 of	  corruption	  and	 patronage	 for
successive	Pakistani	governments	and	the	ISI.
       Due	 to	  the	estranged	 relations	 between	Iran	  and	the	 USA,	  the	 Afghan
Mujaheddin	 groups	based	in	 Iran	received	 no	international	 military	  assistance.
Nor	 did	 the	two	  million	  Afghan	 refugees	who	 fled	  to	Iran	 receive	 the	 same
humanitarian	 aid	which	  their	 three	million	   counterparts	in	 Pakistan	 received.
Tehran's	own	support	 to	 the	Mujaheddin	 was	 limited	 on	account	 of	 budgetary
constraints	because	of	the	 Iraq-Iran	 war.	Thus	 throughout	 the	1980s,	the	 USA
effectively	 blocked	 off	  Iran	from	  the	outside	 world	 on	 Afghanistan.	 It	 was	 a
legacy	which	only	 further	 embittered	the	Iranians	against	the	USA	 and	it	 would
ensure	much	greater	Iranian	assertiveness	in	Afghanistan	once	the	Cold	War	had
ended	and	the	Americans	had	left	the	Afghan	stage.
       Iran's	 initial	 support	 to	the	 Mujaheddin	 only	went	 to	 the	Afghan	 Shias,	in
particular	 the	 Hazaras.	It	 was	 the	 era	 in	 which	 Iran's	 Revolutionary	  Guards
funded	Shia	militants	 worldwide	 –	 from	 Lebanon	to	Pakistan.	By	 1982,	Iranian
money	 and	 influence	 had	 encouraged	 a	 younger	 generation	 of	  Iran-trained
radical	Hazaras,	 to	overthrow	  the	traditional	  leaders	who	 had	emerged	in	 the
Hazarajat	in	1979	to	oppose	the	Soviet	invasion.	Later,	eight	Afghan	Shia	groups
were	given	 official	  status	in	 Tehran,	but	 Iran	 could	never	 arm	and	 fund	 them
sufficiently.	 As	a	result,	the	Iran-backed	Hazaras	became	marginal	to	the	conflict
inside	 Afghanistan	  and	 fought	  more	 amongst	  themselves	 than	 against	 the
Soviets.	Hazara	factionalism	was	exacerbated	by	Iran's	short-sighted,	ideological
policies	in	 which	 the	Hazaras	loyalty	 to	 Tehran	was	viewed	 as	more	important
than	unity	amongst	themselves.
       By	 1988,	 with	 the	Soviet	 withdrawal	 now	 imminent,	 Iran	saw	the	 need	to
strengthen	the	Hazaras.	They	 helped	unite	 the	eight	 Iran-based	Hazara	 groups
into	the	single	 Hizb-e-Wahadat	party.	 Iran	now	 pressed	for	Wahadat's	inclusion
in	international	 negotiations	to	form	 a	new	 Mujaheddin	government,	 which	was
to	be	 dominated	by	 the	 Peshawar-based	Mujaheddin	parties.	 Even	though	 the
Hazaras	were	a	small	minority	 and	could	not	 possibly	hope	to	rule	 Afghanistan,

246
Iran	demanded	first	a	50-per-cent	and	then	a	25-per-cent	share	for	the	Hazaras	in
any	future	Mujaheddin	government.
       As	 the	 rivalry	 between	Iran	 and	Saudi	 Arabia	 intensified	 with	 the	 Saudis
importing	more	 Arabs	to	spread	Wahabbism	and	anti-Shiism	inside	Afghanistan,
Pakistan	kept	the	 balance	between	them.	 A	 close	ally	 of	 both	 states,	Pakistan
stressed	the	need	to	maintain	a	united	front	against	the	Kabul	 regime.	The	Iran–
Saudi	rivalry	  escalated	after	the	 1989	 withdrawal	 of	 Soviet	 troops	 when	 Iran
drew	closer	to	 the	Kabul	 regime.	Iran	 considered	the	Kabul	 regime	as	the	 only
force	now	 capable	of	 resisting	 a	Sunni	 Pashtun	takeover	 of	 Afghanistan.	 Iran
rearmed	Wahadat	 and	 by	  the	 time	 Kabul	  fell	  to	 the	 Mujaheddin	  in	 1992,
Wahadat	controlled	  not	 only	 the	 Hazarajat	 but	 a	significant	  part	 of	 western
Kabul.
       The	 Saudis	meanwhile	suffered	a	major	set	back	as	their	two	principle	 neo-
Wahabbi	 proteégés,	 Gulbuddin	  Hikmetyar	  and	  Abdul	  Rasul	 Sayyaf,	  split.
Hikmetyar	opposed	the	newly	 constituted	Mujaheddin	 government	in	Kabul	 and
joined	up	with	 the	Hazaras	to	bombard	the	city.	Sayyaf	supported	the	Mujheddin
government.	This	 division	 was	 an	extension	 of	the	 much	 larger	Saudi	 foreign
policy	 débâcle	after	Iraq	 invaded	Kuwait	 in	 1990.	For	 20	years	the	 Saudis	had
funded	hundreds	 of	 neo-Wahabbi	 parties	 across	the	 Muslim	 world	  to	 spread
Wahabbism	and	gain	influence	within	 the	Islamic	movements	in	these	countries.
       But	  when	Riyadh	 asked	these	 Islamic	 groups	for	 a	 payback	 and	to	 lend
support	to	Saudi	Arabia	 and	the	USA	 led	coalition	 against	Iraq,	 the	majority	 of
them	backed	Saddam	Hussein,	 including	 Hikmetyar	  and	most	Afghan	  groups.
Years	of	Saudi	 effort	and	 billions	 of	dollars	 were	wasted	because	Saudi	Arabia
had	 failed	  to	  evolve	  a	 national	  interest-based	 foreign	  policy.	   The	 Saudi
predicament	is	having	 a	westernized	 ruling	 elite	 whose	legitimacy	 is	 based	on
conservative	fundamentalism,	while	 those	not	part	of	 the	elite	are	radically	 anti-
Western.	The	elite	has	promoted	radical	Wahabbism,	even	as	this	undermined	its
own	power	 at	 home	and	abroad.	Ironically	  only	 the	 moderate	Afghan	 groups,
whom	the	Saudis	had	ignored,	helped	out	the	Kingdom	in	its	hour	of	 need.5
       As	 the	Afghan	 war	 intensified	 between	1992	 and	1995,	so	 did	the	 rivalry
between	Iran	 and	Saudi	Arabia.	 The	 Saudis	and	 the	Pakistanis	 made	frequent
attempts	to	bring	all	 the	factions	together.	However,	 they	also	made	every	effort
to	 keep	Iran	 and	 the	 Hazaras	out	 of	  any	 potential	 agreements.	In	 the	 1992
Peshawar	Accord	 which	  Pakistan	 and	 Saudi	 Arabia	 negotiated	 between	 the
Mujaheddin	on	how	 to	share	power	in	Kabul	and	in	the	subsequent,	but	abortive,
1993	Islamabad	and	Jalalabad	Accords	to	end	the	civil	war,	Iran	and	the	Hazaras

247
were	sidelined.	The	exclusion	of	Iran	 in	the	1990s	by	Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia,
similar	 to	treatment	 by	 the	USA	 of	 Iran	 in	 the	1980s,	was	 to	further	 embitter
Tehran.
       The	 Iranians	had	also	become	more	pragmatic,	backing	not	just	 the	Afghan
Shias	but	 all	 the	 Persian-speaking	ethnic	 groups	 who	 were	 resisting	 Pashtun
domination.	 Iran	 had	a	natural	 link	  with	 the	 Tajiks	 –	they	 originate	 from	 the
same	ancient	race	 and	speak	the	 same	language	 –	but	 the	 Iranians	 had	been
incensed	by	 Ahmad	 Shah	Masud's	 brutal	 attacks	on	 the	Hazaras	 in	 Kabul	 in
1993.	Nevertheless,	Tehran	now	realized	that	unless	it	backed	the	non-Pashtuns,
Pashtun	Sunnis	would	 dominate	 Afghanistan.	 In	 1993,	 for	 the	first	 time,	 Iran
began	to	give	 substantial	military	 aid	 to	the	 President	Burhanuddin	 Rabbani	in
Kabul	and	 the	Uzbek	warlord	 General	 Rashid	Dostum	and	 urged	all	 the	ethnic
groups	to	join	with	 Rabbani.
       Iran's	  new	  strategy	 intensified	   its	  conflict	  of	  interest	  with	  Pakistan.
Islamabad	was	determined	to	 get	its	 Pashtun	proteges	into	 Kabul	 and	both	the
Pakistanis	and	 the	 Saudis	were	 determined	 to	 keep	 the	 Hazaras	out	  of	 any
power-sharing	  arrangement.	 Pakistan's	 adroit	   diplomacy	  in	  the	  1980s	  in
providing	 a	balance	between	Saudi	and	Iranian	interests	was	now	 abandoned	in
favour	of	the	Saudis.
       The	 collapse	of	 the	Soviet	 Union	 and	the	opening	 up	of	 Central	Asia	 had
given	Iran	 a	new	 impetus	to	 end	its	international	 isolation.	 Iran	 moved	 swiftly
into	 Central	 Asia	  with	 a	 path-breaking	 trip	  by	 Foreign	  Minister	  Ali	  Akbar
Velayti	 in	 November	 1991,	 who	 signed	an	 agreement	to	build	  a	railway	  line
between	Turkmenistan	and	Iran.	 But	 here	too	the	USA	 tried	 to	block	 Iran	 with
US	Secretary	of	State	James	Baker	declaring	in	1992	that	Washington	 would	do
everything	 to	 block	  Iranian	 influence	  in	 Central	 Asia.6	 The	 neo-communist
rulers	in	Central	 Asia	were	 initially	 deeply	 suspicious	of	Iran,	 fearing	it	 wanted
to	spread	Islamic	fundamentalism.
       But	  Iran	 resisted	this	 temptation	 and	also	 forged	 close	ties	 with	  Russia,
following	  the	 1989	 ice-breaking	 visit	  to	 Tehran	 by	 Soviet	 Foreign	 Minister
Eduard	Shevardnadze	when	he	met	 with	 Ayatollah	 Khomeini.	  The	Ayatollah's
sanction	of	closer	Iranian-Soviet	ties	just	 before	his	death,	gave	the	new	Russia	a
legitimacy	 in	Iranian	 eyes.	Also	 between	1989	and	 1993,	Russia	provided	 Iran
with	 US$10	  billion	  worth	  of	  weapons	to	  rebuild	  its	 military	  arsenal.	 Iran
improved	 its	 standing	 in	 the	region	  by	 forging	 links	  with	 other	 non-Muslim
former	Soviet	 states	such	as	Georgia,	Ukraine	and	Armenia.	 Tehran	declined	to
support	Azerbaijan	 in	 its	 war	 with	  Armenia,	 even	 though	20	 per	 cent	of	 the

248
Iranian	population	is	 Azeri	and	helped	Russia	and	the	UN	to	end	the	civil	 war	 in
Tajikistan.7	Crucially,	  Iran	 and	the	CARs	 shared	a	 deep	suspicion	of	 Afghan-
Pashtun	fundamentalism	 and	the	 support	it	 received	 from	 Pakistan	 and	Saudi
Arabia.	Thus,	 an	alliance	between	Iran,	 Russia	and	the	CARs	 in	 support	of	 the
non-Pashtun	ethnic	groups	existed	well	before	the	Taliban	emerged.
       In	  contrast,	 Saudi	 Arabia	  made	 few	 state-to-state	 attempts	 to	 improve
relations	with	Russia	or	the	CARs.	The	Saudis	took	nearly	four	 years	before	they
established	embassies	in	Central	Asian	capitals.	Instead	the	Saudis	sent	millions
of	Korans	 to	Central	 Asia,	funded	 Central	Asian	 Muslims	 on	the	Haj	 and	gave
scholarships	for	 their	 mullahs	to	 study	 in	 Saudi	Arabia	 –	 where	they	 imbibed
Wahabbism.	These	measures	only	perturbed	Central	Asia's	rulers.	 Within	 a	few
years	 the	 rulers	  of	  Uzbekistan,	 Kazakhstan	  and	 Kyrgyzstan	  were	  to	 call
Wahabbism	the	biggest	political	threat	to	stability	 in	their	 countries.8
       Saudi	 Arabia	 viewed	 the	Taliban	 as	an	important	 asset	to	their	 dwindling
influence	in	Afghanistan.	 The	first	 Saudi	contacts	with	the	Taliban	 were	through
princely	hunting	 trips.	Maulana	Fazlur	 Rehman	head	of	Pakistan's	JUI	organized
the	first	 bustard	 hunting	 trips	 for	 Saudi	 and	Gulf	  princes	to	 Kandahar	 in	 the
winter	 of	  1994-95.	 The	 Arab	  hunting	 parties	 flew	  into	  Kandahar	 on	 huge
transport	planes	bringing	dozens	of	luxury	 jeeps,	many	of	which	they	 left	behind
along	with	 donations	 for	 their	Taliban	 hosts,	after	 the	hunt.	 Saudi	Intelligence
chief	Prince	 Turki	 then	 began	to	 visit	 Kandahar	regularly.	  After	 Turki	 visited
Islamabad	and	Kandahar	in	 July	1996,	 the	Saudis	provided	funds,	 vehicles	and
fuel	for	the	successful	Taliban	attack	on	Kabul.	 Two	Saudi	companies,	Delta	and
Ningarcho,	were	 now	involved	 in	 the	gas	pipeline	 projects	 across	Afghanistan,
increasing	local	business	pressure	on	Riyadh	to	help	ensure	a	Taliban	victory.
       But	  it	  was	 the	 Wahabbi	  ulemain	 the	 Kingdom	  who	  played	 the	 most
influential	 role	in	 urging	the	Royal	Family	 to	 back	the	Taliban.	The	ulemaplay	a
leading	advisory	 role	 to	the	Saudi	 monarch	in	 the	Council	 of	 the	Assembly	 of
Senior	 Ulemaand	  four	   other	  state	 organizations.	  They	  have	  consistently
supported	the	export	of	Wahabbism	throughout	 the	Muslim	 world	and	the	Royal
Family	 remains	extremely	 sensitive	to	 ulemaopinion.9	King	 Fahd	 had	to	call	 a
meeting	of	350	ulemato	persuade	them	to	issue	a	fatwa	allowing	US	troops	 to	be
based	in	the	Kingdom	  during	 the	1990	war	 with	 Iraq.10	Saudi	Intelligence	 co-
operated	closely	 with	  the	 ulemaas	 did	 numerous	 state-run	 Islamic	 charities,
which	had	funded	the	Afghan	 Mujaheddin	in	 the	1980s	and	now	began	to	do	the
same	for	the	Taliban.	Moreover,	 the	ulemahad	the	vast	network	 of	mosques	and
madrassasin	the	 Kingdom	 under	 their	 control	  and	it	 was	 here	during	  Friday

249
sermons	that	they	built	up	public	grass-roots	support	for	the	Taliban.11
       According	   to	 the	 Saudi	 analyst	 Nawaf	  Obaid,	 the	  key	 players	 in	  the
ulemawho	pushed	for	Saudi	support	to	the	Taliban	 were	Sheikh	Abdul	 Aziz	 Bin
Baz,	the	Grand	Mufti	  and	Chairman	of	 the	Council	 of	 Senior	ulemaand	Sheikh
Mohammed	Bin	 Juber,	the	Minister	 of	Justice	and	a	key	member	of	 the	Council
of	the	ulema.12	In	return,	the	Taliban	demonstrated	their	reverence	for	the	Royal
Family	and	the	ulemaand	copied	Wahabbi	practices	such	as	introducing	religious
police.	In	 April	  1997,	 Taliban	 leader	Mullah	  Rabbani	met	 with	 King	 Fahd	 in
Riyadh	and	 praised	the	Saudis	effusively.	  ‘Since	Saudi	 Arabia	 is	the	 centre	of
the	Muslim	 world	 we	would	 like	to	 have	Saudi	assistance.	King	Fahd	expressed
happiness	at	the	good	measures	taken	by	the	Taliban	and	over	the	imposition	 of
Sharia	in	 our	country,’	  Rabbani	said.13	Meeting	 King	 Fahd	 five	 months	later,
Taliban	 leaders	said	the	 Saudis	had	 promised	 more	aid.	 ‘King	  Fahd	 was	too
kind.	The	 Saudis	have	promised	 us	as	much	as	they	 can	give	 us,’	said	 Mullah
Mohammed	Stanakzai.14
       Riyadh's	 support	 for	 the	Taliban	  made	them	extremely	 reluctant	 to	 exert
any	pressure	on	the	Taliban	to	 deport	Osama	Bin	 Laden,	even	though	the	 USA
was	urging	 them	to	do	 so.	Only	 when	Prince	 Turki	 was	personally	 insulted	by
Mullah	 Omar	  in	 Kandahar	 did	 the	 Saudis	 curtail	  diplomatic	  links	 with	  the
Taliban.	 Significantly,	   it	 was	 a	 personal	 insult	  that	 guided	 Saudi	 decision-
making	 rather	 than	 an	 overall	  change	in	  foreign	 policy.	  Saudi	 Arabia	  still
appeared	to	have	learnt	 little	 from	 its	 negative	experiences	of	 trying	 to	 export
Wahabbism.
       Saudi	 Arabia's	initial	  support	for	 the	Taliban	 convinced	Iran	 that	the	USA
was	also	backing	them	in	an	intensification	 of	its	 1980s	policies	to	surround	Iran
with	hostile	 forces	and	isolate	it.	 The	USA,	according	 to	Tehran,	had	a	new	aim
to	promote	 oil	 and	gas	pipelines	 from	 Central	 Asia	 which	 would	 bypass	Iran.
After	 the	 Taliban	  captured	Kabul,	  Iranian	 newspapers	 echoed	the	 long-held
views	of	 officials.	 ‘The	 Taliban	capture	of	 Kabul	 was	designed	by	Washington,
financed	by	Riyadh	and	logistically	  supported	by	Islamabad,’	wrote	 the	Jomhuri
hlaminewspaper.15
       However,	 for	 Tehran	 the	real	 fall-out	 with	 Afghanistan	 was	 internal.	 The
leadership	was	divided	 between	hardliners,	 who	still	  hankered	after	supporting
Shias	worldwide	 and	moderates	who	 wanted	 a	more	measured	support	 for	 the
anti-Taliban	alliance	 and	less	confrontation	with	 the	Taliban.	 Iran	suffered	 from
the	same	problems	as	Pakistan	in	having	multiple	departments	and	lobbies	trying

250
to	push	 their	 personal	 vested	interests	 in	 the	 making	 of	 Afghan	 policy.	  The
Iranian	military,	  the	 Revolutionary	 Guards,	the	 intelligence	 agencies,	the	Shia
clergy	and	the	powerful	Bunyads	or	Foundations	which	 are	run	by	the	clergy	and
control	 much	 of	  the	 state	 sector	 economy	 and	 also	 finance	 foreign	  policy
adventures	with	their	large,	unaccounted	funds,	were	just	some	of	the	contending
lobbies.
       All	  these	lobbies	had	 to	be	kept	 on	an	 even	keel	by	 the	Foreign	 Ministry
and	 Alaeddin	   Boroujerdi,	  the	  Deputy	  Foreign	   Minister	  for	   Afghanistan.
Boroujerdi,	  who	 ran	  Afghan	 policy	   for	 more	  than	 a	 decade	 was	 a	 smart
diplomat.	He	 had	outlasted	the	earlier	regime	of	 President	Akbar	Ali	  Rafsanjani
to	take	up	the	same	appointment	under	President	Khatami,	until	he	was	forced	to
resign	after	the	Iranian	diplomats	 were	killed	 in	Mazar.	He	 could	be	both	a	dove
and	a	hawk	on	Afghanistan	–	 depending	on	whom	he	was	talking	 to	and	he	also
had	to	ensure	that	Iran's	conflict	 of	interests	with	 Pakistan	and	Saudi	Arabia	 did
not	get	 out	of	 hand.	 In	contrast,	 in	 Saudi	Arabia,	 the	 Foreign	Minister	  Prince
Saud	al	Faisal,	deferred	Afghan	 policy	 to	 his	younger	brother	 Prince	Turki	 and
Saudi	Intelligence.16
       The	 collapse	of	the	Afghan	state	increased	Iran's	own	insecurity	by	 creating
a	massive	 influx	  of	 drugs	and	 weapons.	The	 spectre	 of	 Afghanistan's	 ethnic
conflict	  threatened	 to	 spill	   into	  Iran	 along	  with	  the	 economic	  burden	 of
supporting	millions	  of	Afghan	 refugees,	who	 were	deeply	 disliked	 by	 ordinary
Iranians.	There	are	an	estimated	three	million	  heroin	addicts	in	 Iran	 –	the	same
number	 as	in	  Pakistan	although	  Iran,	 with	  60	 million	  people,	 has	 half	  the
population	of	Pakistan.	The	smuggling	 of	fuel,	 foodstuffs	and	other	goods	out	of
Iran	to	Afghanistan	 created	losses	in	revenue	and	periodic	economic	problems	–
just	when	Iran	 faced	a	dramatic	fall	 in	 revenue	because	of	the	drop	in	world	 oil
prices	and	was	trying	to	rebuild	its	economy.
       Of	 even	 greater	concern	to	 the	Iranians	 was	that,	since	 1996,	the	Taliban
were	also	secretly	 backing	Iranian	 groups	who	 were	anti-regime.	 In	 Kandahar,
the	Taliban	 had	given	 sanctuary	to	Ahl-e-Sunnah	 Wal	 Jamaat,	which	 recruited
Iranian	Sunni	militants	 from	Khorasan	and	Sistan	provinces.	Its	spokesmen	from
Iran's	Turkmen,	 Baluchi	 and	Afghan	 minorities,	  claimed	that	 their	 aim	 was	to
overthrow	the	 Shia	regime	in	 Tehran	and	impose	a	Taliban-style	 Sunni	 regime.
This	was	a	bizarre	aspiration	given	that	over	90	per	cent	of	 Iran's	population	was
Shia,	although	it	 presumably	helped	to	bolster	support	 among	the	small	band	of
insurgents.	The	group	 received	weapons	and	support	 from	 the	Taliban	 and	the
Iranians	were	convinced	that	the	Pakistanis	were	also	sponsoring	them.

251
       Iranian	 military	  aid	 to	 the	anti-Taliban	 alliance	 escalated	after	 the	fall	 of
Kabul	in	 1996	and	again	after	 the	fall	 of	 Mazar	in	 1998.	However,	 Iran	had	no
contiguous	 border	 with	 the	 alliance	  and	was	 forced	  to	 either	 fly	  in	 or	 rail
supplies	  to	   Masud's	  forces,	   which	   involved	    getting	   permission	  from
Turkmenistan,	Uzbekistan	and	Kyrgyzstan.	 In	 1998,	Iranian	Intelligence	 flew	 in
plane-loads	of	 arms	to	 Ahmad	Shah	 Masud's	base	in	 Kuliab	 in	 Tajikistan	 and
Masud	became	a	frequent	visitor	  to	Tehran.	 The	danger	which	 the	Iran	 supply
line	faced	was	highlighted	 when	 Kyrgyzstan's	security	 forces	stopped	a	train	 in
October	1998,	 in	 which	 were	 discovered	16	 railcars	 loaded	with	  700	 tons	of
arms	and	ammunition.	The	train	 had	been	travelling	from	 Iran	to	Tajikistan	 with
the	weapons	disguised	as	humanitarian	aid.17
       The	 Taliban	  were	incensed	 with	 Iran's	 support	 for	 the	 alliance.	 In	 June
1997,	the	Taliban	 closed	down	 the	Iranian	Embassy	in	 Kabul,	 accusing	Iran	 of
destroying	 peace	 and	  stability	  in	  Afghanistan’.18	  A	  Taliban	  statement	 in
September	1997	after	their	failure	 to	capture	Mazar	was	explicit.	 ‘Iranian	 planes
in	gross	violation	 of	 all	 internationally	 accepted	norms	intrude	our	 country's	air
space	to	 airlift	  supplies	 to	 airports	  controlled	 by	 the	 opposition.	  The	 grave
consequencs	of	such	interference	will	rest	with	Iran	which	 is	the	enemy	of	Islam.
Afghanistan	is	capable	of	harbouring	opponents	of	the	Iranian	government	inside
Afghan	territory	 and	thus	of	creating	problems	for	Iran,’	 the	statement	said.19
       However,	 it	 was	the	killing	  of	the	 Iranian	diplomats	 in	Mazar	 in	1998	 that
nearly	 forced	 Iran	 into	  war	 with	 the	 Taliban.	  There	 was	 enormous	popular
support	 for	 an	 Iranian	  invasion	 of	 western	 Afghanistan,	  which	  was	 further
manipulated	by	 hardliners	in	 Tehran	wanting	 to	 destabilize	President	Khatami.
Even	 the	  reticent	 Foreign	  Minister	  Kamal	  Kharrazi	   was	 forced	  to	 adopt
extremely	tough	language.	‘The	 Taliban	are	Pushtuns	and	cannot	sideline	all	the
other	 ethnic	  groups	 from	  the	  political	  scene	 without	   sparking	 continuing
resistance.	In	such	circumstances	there	will	  be	no	peace	in	 the	country.	 I	warn
the	Taliban	and	those	who	 support	them	that	we	will	  not	tolerate	instability	  and
conspiracy	 along	 our	 borders.	 We	 had	an	 agreement	 with	 Pakistan	 that	 the
Afghan	problem	would	 not	be	resolved	through	war.	 Now	this	has	happened	and
we	cannot	accept	it,’	Kharrazi	said	on	14	August	1998.20
       Iran	  felt	  betrayed	 by	 Pakistan	 on	  several	 counts.	 In	 1996,	  just	 when
President	Burhanuddin	Rabbani,	under	Iranian	advice,	was	trying	 to	broaden	the
base	of	 his	government	 and	 bring	 in	 Pashtuns	and	other	 groups,	 the	Taliban
captured	Kabul.	  Iran	 was	 convinced	  that	 Pakistan	 had	 sabotaged	Rabbani's
effort.	In	 June	1997,	Prime	Minister	Nawaz	 Sharif	visited	 Tehran.	Together	with

252
President	Khatami	 the	 two	 leaders	called	 for	 a	 cease-fire	in	 Afghanistan	 and
declared	that	 there	 could	  be	 no	 military	  solution.	  But	 Iran	  considered	that
Pakistan	had	no	 intention	  of	 sticking	 to	 the	 agreement.	‘Pakistan	 has	left	 no
room	for	 our	trust	 and	has	destabilized	its	position	 with	 the	Iranian	 people.	We
cannot	accept	seeing	Pakistan	cause	problems	for	 our	 national	security,’	  wrote
the	Jomhuri	luami.21
       Then,	 in	 the	summer	 of	1998,	 Pakistan	persuaded	Iran	 to	participate	 in	 a
joint	  diplomatic	  peace	 mission.	 Mid-level	   Iranian	  and	 Pakistani	  diplomats
travelled	together	for	the	first	 time	to	Mazar	and	Kandahar	on	4	July	1998	to	talk
to	the	opposing	factions.	Just	a	few	 weeks	later,	the	Taliban	attacked	Mazar	and
slaughtered	the	 Iranian	 diplomats,	 scuttling	  the	 initiative.	  The	 Iranians	 were
convinced	 that	 Pakistan	 had	 duped	 them	 by	  pretending	 to	 launch	  a	 peace
initiative,	 just	 as	 the	ISI	 was	 preparing	 the	Taliban	  for	 the	attack	 on	 Mazar.
Moreover,	Iran	claimed	 that	Pakistan	had	promised	the	safety	of	its	 diplomats	in
Mazar.	When	 they	 were	killed,	  Iran	 was	furious	  and	blamed	 the	Taliban	 and
Pakistan.	Iranian	officials	 said	that	 Mullah	 Dost	Mohammed,	 who	allegedly	 led
the	Taliban	seizure	of	 the	Iranian	 Consulate,	had	first	gathered	the	diplomats	 in
the	 basement	of	  the	 building	  and	 spoken	 by	  wireless	 to	 Kandahar	  before
shooting	them	dead.22
       The	 Taliban	 replied,	 correctly	  as	it	 appeared,	that	 the	 Iranians	were	 not
diplomats	 but	 intelligence	  agents	involved	  in	 ferrying	  weapons	 to	 the	 anti-
Taliban	alliance.	Nevertheless,	in	 the	diplomatic	 skirmishing	 that	followed,	 trust
between	Iran	and	Pakistan	evaporated.23	The	Iranians	were	also	furious	that	the
Taliban	actions	 had	endangered	its	growing	  rapprochement	with	 the	USA.	 US
Secretary	of	State	Madeleine	Albright	 had	said	in	June	1998,	the	critical	role	that
Iran	plays	 in	the	 region,	‘makes	 the	question	 of	 USA–Iran	 relations	a	 topic	 of
great	interest	and	importance	to	this	Secretary	of	State.’24
       The	 Iranians	had	been	encouraged	that	the	USA	was	taking	 them	seriously
for	the	 first	 time.	 USA–Iran	 co-operation	on	 Afghanistan,	 ‘certainly	 can	 be	an
exemplary	case	and	shows	that	the	US	has	a	better	understanding	of	the	reality	in
this	 region	 and	 the	role	  that	 Iran	 can	play	  for	 the	 promotion	  of	 peace	and
security,’	 Kamal	Kharrazi	 told	 me.	‘We	 have	been	trying	 for	a	long	 time	to	 tell
them	[the	USA]	 that	Iran	 is	a	key	player	 in	the	region.’25	Iran	 and	the	USA	had
also	 drawn	 closer	 because	 of	 Washington's	  changed	perceptions	  about	 the
Taliban.	 Both	 countries	 now	 shared	the	 same	views	 and	were	 critical	  of	 the
Taliban's	drug	 and	gender	policies,	 their	harbouring	 of	 terrorists	 and	the	threat

253
that	 the	  Taliban's	 brand	  of	  Islamic	  fundamentalism	  posed	 to	 the	  region.
Ironically	 for	 the	USA,	 the	new	threat	 was	no	longer	 Shia	fundamentalism,	but
the	Sunni	fundamentalism	of	the	Taliban.
       The	 Taliban	 were	 now	 even	proving	 an	 embarrassment	to	Saudi	 Arabia,
which	 helped	bring	 Tehran	closer	 to	 Riyadh.	The	 Taliban's	 harbouring	 of	Bin
Laden	 had	 exposed	their	  extremism	 and	 posed	 a	 threat	 to	  Saudi	 stability.
Significantly,	 the	 rapprochement	between	Iran	and	 Saudi	Arabia	 did	 not	falter,
even	when	Iran	 was	threatening	 to	invade	 Afghanistan	 in	 1998.	In	 May	 1999,
President	Khatami	visited	Saudi	Arabia,	 the	first	Iranian	leader	to	do	so	in	nearly
three	decades.
       The	 Taliban	 pose	a	security	 threat	 to	the	 Saudis,	especially	 through	their
support	for	Saudi	dissidents.	In	 the	past	the	Saudis	had	deferred	to	the	Taliban's
fundamentalism,	 without	  giving	 due	 thought	 to	 what	 kind	  of	 state,	 political
compromises	and	power-sharing	 should	 evolve	in	 Afghanistan,	 but	 they	could
no	longer	afford	 to	 take	such	a	casual	attitude.	 With	 so	much	 of	Saudi	 foreign
policy	 run	on	the	basis	of	 personal	relationships	and	patronage	rather	than	state
institutions,	 it	 has	become	difficult	   to	see	how	 a	 policy	 towards	 Afghanistan,
geared	more	to	Saudi	national	self-interest	and	stability	 in	the	region,	rather	than
Wahabbism,	can	evolve.
       If	 President	Khatami	 were	to	 push	forward	his	 reform	agenda	at	home,	the
Iranian	 regime	  would	  increasingly	  desire	 and	 need	 a	 peace	 settlement	 in
Afghanistan	 –	to	 end	the	 drain	on	 its	 resources	from	 funding	 the	anti-Taliban
alliance,	stop	the	 drugs,	weapons	and	sectarian	spillover	 from	 Afghanistan	 and
move	towards	 a	further	 rapprochement	with	 the	USA.	 Ironically,	  the	 Taliban's
extremism	 had	also	 helped	 bring	 Iran	 and	 Saudi	 Arabia	 closer	 together	 and
weakened	Pakistan's	relationship	with	 both	 countries.	The	big	 loser	from	 Iran's
return	to	the	diplomatic	 mainstream	was	 Pakistan.	However,	to	end	 its	isolation
from	 the	 West,	  Iran	 needed	 to	 demonstrate	 that	 it	  was	 a	 responsible	 and
stabilizing	 member	 of	 the	 international	 community.	  Its	 first	  and	biggest	 test
could	be	in	helping	to	bring	 peace	to	Afghanistan.

                                           THE	    FUTURE
                                    OF	   AFGHANISTAN



	
Afghanistan	has	become	one	of	‘the	world's	orphaned	conflicts	–	the	ones	that
the	West,	selective	and	promiscuous	in	its	attention	happens	to	ignore	in	favour
of	Yugoslavia’,	 said	former	UN	 Secretary	General	Boutros	Boutros-Ghali	in
1995.1	The	world	has	turned	away	from	Afghanistan,	allowing	civil	war,	ethnic
fragmentation	and	polarization	to	become	state	failure.	The	country	has	ceased
to	exist	 as	a	 viable	state	and	when	 a	state	fails	 civil	 society	 is	destroyed.
Generations	of	children	grow	up	 rootless,	without	identity	 or	 reason	to	live
except	to	fight.	Adults	are	traumatized	and	brutalized,	knowing	only	war	and	the
power	of	the	warlords.	‘We	are	dealing	here	with	a	failed	state	which	looks	like
an	infected	wound.	You	don't	even	know	where	to	start	cleaning	it,’	said	UN
mediator	Lakhdar	Brahimi.2
       The	entire	Afghan	population	has	been	displaced,	not	once	but	many	times
over.	The	physical	destruction	of	Kabul	has	turned	it	into	the	Dresden	of	the	late
twentieth	century.	The	crossroads	of	Asia	on	the	 ancient	Silk	Route	is	 now
nothing	but	miles	of	rubble.	There	is	no	semblance	of	an	infrastructure	that	can
sustain	society	–	even	at	the	lowest	common	denominator	of	poverty.	In	1998
the	ICRC	reported	that	the	number	of	Afghan	families	headed	by	a	widow	had
reached	98,000,	the	number	of	families	headed	by	a	disabled	person	was	63,000
and	45,000	people	were	treated	for	war	wounds	that	year	alone.	There	was	not
even	an	estimate	of	those	killed.	The	only	productive	factories	in	the	country	are
those	where	artificial	limbs,	crutches	and	wheelchairs	are	produced	by	the	aid
agencies.3
       Afghanistan's	divisions	are	multiple	–	 ethnic,	sectarian,	rural	and	urban,
educated	and	uneducated,	those	with	guns	and	those	who	have	been	disarmed.
The	economy	is	a	black	hole	that	is	sucking	in	its	neighbours	with	illicit	trade
and	the	smuggling	of	drugs	and	weapons,	undermining	them	in	the	process.	‘It
will	 take	at	 least	ten	to	 15	years	before	there	will	  be	a	functioning	 central
authority	capable	of	doing	the	minimum	of	 the	administration	needed	for	the

256
development	 of	 the	 country.	  And	  that	 is,	 in	  my	  view,	 a	 rather	  optimistic
statement,’	said	Swedish	aid-worker	Anders	Fange.4
       Complex	 relationships	 of	power	 and	authority	 built	 up	over	centuries	have
broken	down	completely.	 No	single	group	or	 leader	has	the	legitimacy	to	reunite
the	country.	 Rather	 than	 a	national	 identity	  or	 kinship-tribal-based	 identities,
territorial	 regional	 identities	 have	 become	paramount.	 Afghans	 no	longer	 call
themselves	 just	  Afghans	  or	  even	  Pashtuns	 and	  Tajiks,	  but	  Kandaharis,
Panjshiris,	 Heratis,	 Kabulis	 or	 Jowzjanis.	 Fragmentation	 is	 both	 vertical	 and
horizontal	and	 cuts	across	ethnicity	 to	encompass	a	single	 valley	 or	town.	 The
Pashtun	tribal	structure	has	been	destroyed	by	the	loss	of	common	tribal	property
and	grazing	 grounds,	 and	 by	 war	 and	 flight.	 The	 non-Pashtun	 identify	  their
survival	with	 individual	 warrior	 leaders	and	the	valley	of	their	birth.
       The	 tribal	 hierarchy	which	 once	mediated	conflicts	 has	been	killed	 or	is	 in
exile.	The	 old,	educated,	ruling	 elite	 fled	 after	the	 Soviet	invasion	 and	no	 new
ruling	 elite	 has	emerged	in	 its	 place	 which	 can	 negotiate	a	 peace	settlement.
There	is	 no	 political	  class	to	 compromise	 and	make	 deals.	There	 are	lots	 of
leaders	representing	segments	of	the	population,	but	no	outright	leader.	In	such	a
scenario,	with	 no	end	to	 the	war	 in	 sight,	the	question	 of	whether	 Afghanistan
will	 fragment	 and	send	waves	of	 ethnic	 fragmentation	 and	instability	  spinning
through	the	region,	becomes	paramount.
       Much	  of	 the	blame	 for	 the	 continuation	 of	 the	 war	 lies	 in	 the	hands	 of
outsiders	who	 continue	 to	  back	their	  proxies	 in	 an	 ever-increasing	 spiral	 of
intervention	and	violence.	 The	FSU	began	the	process	with	its	brutal	invasion	 of
Afghanistan,	 but	 suffered	hugely.	 ‘We	  brought	 Afghanistan	 with	 us	 –	 in	 our
souls,	in	our	 hearts,	in	our	 memory,	in	 our	customs,	in	 everything	 and	at	every
level,’	 said	 Alexander	 Lebed,	 who	 served	 as	a	 major	 in	 the	 Soviet	 army	 in
Afghanistan	and	is	now	a	presidential	candidate.	‘This	 feeble	political	 adventure,
this	attempt	 to	export	 a	still	 unproved	 revolution,	 marked	the	 beginning	of	 the
end,’	he	added.5
       The	 Afghan	Mujaheddin	 contributed	 to	the	demise	of	the	Soviet	Union,	 the
Soviet	empire	and	even	communism	itself.	 While	 the	Afghans	take	all	 credit	for
this,	 the	 West	 has	 gone	 the	 other	 way,	  barely	 acknowledging	  the	 Afghan
contribution	 to	the	end	of	 the	Cold	 War.	The	 withdrawal	 of	 Soviet	troops	from
Afghanistan	heralded	the	 end	of	 the	Gorba-chov	 experiment	in	 perestroika	and
glasnost	–	the	idea	that	the	Soviet	system	could	be	changed	from	within.	There	is
a	 lesson	 to	  be	 learnt	  here	 for	  today's	  meddlers	 those	 who	  intervene	  in
Afghanistan	can	face	disintegration	 themselves	not	because	of	the	power	 of	 the

257
Afghans,	 but	 because	of	  the	forces	  that	 are	unleashed	 in	 their	 own	  fragile
societies.
       By	 walking	 away	from	 Afghanistan	as	early	as	it	did,	the	USA	 faced	within
a	few	years	dead	diplomats,	destroyed	embassies,	bombs	in	New	York	and	cheap
heroin	 on	 its	  streets,	 as	 Afghanistan	 became	 a	 sanctuary	 for	  international
terrorism	and	 the	drugs	mafia.	 Afghans	 today	 remain	deeply	 bitter	 about	their
abandonment	by	the	USA,	for	 whom	they	fought	 the	Cold	War.	In	 the	1980s	the
USA	 was	prepared	‘to	  fight	 till	  the	 last	Afghan’	  to	 get	even	 with	 the	 Soviet
Union,	 but	when	 the	Soviets	 left,	 Washington	 was	not	 prepared	to	 help	bring
peace	or	feed	a	hungry	people.	Regional	 powers	took	advantage	of	 the	political
vacuum	 the	 US	 retreat	 created,	saw	 an	 opportunity	  to	 wield	  influence	 and
jumped	into	the	fray.
       Today	 the	 USA,	 by	 picking	 up	 single	 issues	and	creating	 entire	 policies
around	them,	whether	it	be	oil	 pipelines,	the	treatment	of	 women	or	terrorism,	 is
only	demonstrating	 that	it	 has	learnt	 little.	 The	 abortive	Unocal	 project	 should
have	taught	many	lessons	to	US	 policy-makers,	but	 there	appear	to	be	no	signs
of	 it	  as	 US	  diplomats	  scurry	 across	 Central	  Asia	  trying	  to	 persuade	 oil
companies	and	governments	to	commit	 to	building	 a	main	 export	pipeline	 from
Baku	to	Ceyhan.	But	 even	that	is	 likely	 to	 be	indefinitely	 delayed.	The	 start-up
for	construction	 scheduled	for	 the	year	2000	 has	been	progressively	delayed	to
2003	and	most	recently	to	2005.6
       The	 lessons	from	 the	Unocal	 project	 are	several.	No	 major	 pipeline	 from
Central	 Asia	 can	 be	 built	  unless	 there	 is	 far	  greater	 US	 and	 international
commitment	 to	 conflict	   resolution	 in	  the	 region	 in	 Afghanistan,	  Tajikistan,
Nagorno-Karabakh,	 Chechnya,	Georgia	 and	 with	 the	 Kurds.	 The	 region	 is	 a
powder	keg	 of	unresolved	 conflicts.	 Nor	 can	secure	pipelines	 be	built	 without
some	degree	of	 strategic	 consensus	in	 the	region.	 Iran	 and	 Russia	cannot	 be
isolated	from	 the	region's	 development	for	 ever.	 They	will	  resist	and	 sabotage
projects	as	long	as	they	are	not	 a	part	of	them.	 Nor	can	pipelines	 be	built	 when
ethnic	conflicts	are	tearing	states	apart.	Ethnicity	is	the	clarion	 call	of	the	modern
era.	Trying	 to	resolve	ethnic	 problems	and	keep	states	together	needs	persistent
and	consistent	 diplomacy	 rather	 than	 virtual	 bribes	 to	 keep	 various	warlords
quiet.
       Oil	  companies	cannot	build	  pipelines	which	  are	vulnerable	 to	civil	  wars,
fast-moving	 political	 changes	and	events,	instability	  and	an	 environment	beset
by	Islamic	  fundamentalism,	 drugs	and	 guns.	The	 old	 Great	 Game	was	 about
perceived	threats	 in	 which	  force	 was	 never	directly	  used.	 Russia	and	 Great

258
Britain	 marked	out	borders	and	signed	treaties,	creating	Afghanistan	 as	a	buffer
between	them.	The	new	 Great	Game	must	be	one	 where	the	aim	 is	to	 stabilize
and	settle	the	region,	not	increase	tensions	and	antagonism.	The	USA	is	the	only
world	power	which	 has	the	ability	 to	influence	all	 the	neighbouring	states	to	stop
interfering	in	 Afghanistan.	 It	has	to	do	so	with	 far	 more	commitment	than	 it	has
demonstrated	so	far.
       Pakistan,	weakened	by	the	demise	of	 its	strategic	partnership	with	 the	USA
after	the	end	of	 the	Cold	 War	and	 in	the	throes	 of	a	deep	economic	 crisis,	was
nevertheless	determined	to	extend	its	zone	of	influence	by	trying	 to	nominate	the
next	government	 in	  Kabul.	 Faced	with	  a	 belligerent	 Indian	 neighbour	 seven
times	 its	  size,	 Pakistan's	 obsession	 with	  security	 has	 naturally	  shaped	 its
domestic	politics	 and	foreign	 policy	 concerns	since	it	 was	created	in	1947.	 But
the	military-bureaucratic-intelligence	    elite	 that	 has	 guided	 Pakistan's	destiny
since	the	1950s	has	never	allowed	 civil	  society	to	 function.	 Only	 this	elite	 has
had	the	right	to	 determine	the	nature	of	the	 threat	to	Pakistan's	national	security
and	its	 solutions-not	  elected	governments,	 parliament,	 civic	  organizations	 or
even	common	sense.
       Since	   1988,	  four	   elected	   governments	  have	  been	  dismissed,	   ten
governments	have	 come	and	 gone	and	 domestic	 stability	  is	still	  as	distant	 a
dream	as	ever.7	With	such	deep	crises	of	identity,	political	 legitimacy,	 economic
mismanagement	and	social	 polarization,	 the	elite	 has	nevertheless	indulged	 in
the	worst	example	of	imperial	 overstretch	by	any	third	world	 country	in	 the	latter
half	 of	 this	 century.	 Pakistan	 is	 now	 fighting	  proxy	  wars	 on	 two	 fronts,	 in
Kashmir	and	Afghanistan	 and	even	though	 the	repercussions	from	these	wars	–
Islamic	 fundamentalism,	  drugs,	 weapons	 and	 social	 breakdown	  –	 are	 now
aggressively	spilling	 into	 the	 country,	there	 is	no	 reappraisal	or	policy	  review.
Pakistan	is	now	ripe	 for	a	Taliban-style	 Islamic	 revolution,	 which	 would	almost
certainly	jeopardize	stability	 in	the	Middle	 East,	South	and	Central	Asia.
       What	  Pakistan's	policy-makers	  have	 failed	 to	 realize	 is	 that	 any	 stable
government	 in	  Kabul	 will	   have	 to	 depend	 on	  Pakistan	 for	 reconstruction,
foodstuffs,	fuel	 and	access	to	the	outside	world.	Pakistan's	own	 economy	would
benefit	as	it	would	 provide	 workers,	technicians	and	materials	 for	Afghanistan's
reconstruction.	The	Afghan	refugees	would	return,	 easing	the	financial	burden	of
sustaining	 them	 and	Pakistan	 could	 begin	  to	 reassert	some	 control	 over	 its
dilapidated	state	institutions	and	borders.
       While	 Pakistan	has	had	a	forward	 policy	in	 Afghanistan,	 Iran's	interference
has	essentially	been	defensive,	 maintaining	 a	limited	  influence	 and	resisting	 a

259
total	Taliban	 takeover.	But	 Iran	has	contributed	 heavily	 to	the	fragmentation	 of
Afghanistan	by	playing	 the	Shia	card,	the	Persian	language	card	and	keeping	the
very	ethnic	groups	it	 supports	divided	amongst	themselves.	The	disparateness	of
the	Hazaras	and	the	Uzbeks,	the	 two	ethnic	 groups	Iran	 has	provided	 the	most
aid	to,	is	 sufficient	 to	show	 how	Iran's	 policy	 of	divide	 and	rule	 has	devastated
the	anti-Taliban	alliance.	Iran's	policies	 have	reflected	the	intense	power	struggle
within	the	Iranian	 elite	which	has	only	intensified	 in	the	last	two	years.
       Moreover,	 the	complete	breakdown	of	trust	 and	understanding	between	Iran
and	Pakistan	has	set	back	the	peace	process	and	proved	ruinous	for	the	Afghans.
There	is	no	common	ground	 between	the	two	states	on	a	solution	to	 the	Afghan
civil	 war	and	even	more	ominously	 both	 states	are	funding	proxy	 wars	between
Shias	and	Sunnis	in	each	other's	countries	as	well	 as	in	Afghanistan,	 increasing
the	likelihood	 of	 a	major	 sectarian	explosion	 in	the	 region.	With	  the	advent	of
the	Taliban,	sectarianism	and	ethnic/sectarian	cleansing	has	reared	its	ugly	 head
for	the	first	time	 in	Afghanistan's	history.
       The	 Central	 Asian	states	are	the	 new	players	 on	the	block,	 but	 they	 have
quickly	 taken	to	 protecting	 what	 they	see	as	threats	to	 their	 national	 interests.
Pashtun	domination	of	 Afghanistan	 does	not	suit	them	 and	they	abhor	 the	kind
of	 Islamic	   sentiments	 the	 Taliban	  espouse.	 Until	   their	  ethnic	  cousins	 in
Afghanistan	are	part	of	some	power-sharing	formula	 in	Kabul,	 the	Central	Asian
states	will	 not	 cease	to	aid	them	 to	resist	 the	Taliban.	 This	 places	in	 jeopardy
Pakistan's	 plans	 for	   accessing	 pipeline	  and	 communication	   routes	 across
Afghanistan	 from	  Central	 Asia.	  If	  the	 Taliban	  were	 to	 conquer	 the	  entire
country,	the	 Central	Asian	 states	would	 have	to	 accept	the	Taliban	 reality,	 but
they	 would	 be	 unlikely	  to	 trust	 their	  energy	exports	 to	 go	 through	  Taliban
controlled	Afghanistan	 and	Pakistan.
       Saudi	  Arabia,	 it	  appears,	has	 proved	 incapable	 of	  evolving	  a	 rational
foreign	policy	 which	 suits	its	 national	interests	rather	 than	merely	appeasing	its
domestic	Wahabbi	lobby.	 It	took	 Mullah	 Omar	to	personally	insult	 the	House	of
Saud	before	 the	 Saudis	pulled	 away	 from	  the	 Taliban.	 The	 Saudi	 export	 of
Wahabbism	has	now	boomeranged	back	home	 and	is	increasingly	 undermining
the	authority	of	 the	Royal	Family.	 Osama	Bin	 Laden's	critique	of	 the	corruption
and	mismanagement	of	 the	 regime	 is	not	 falling	  upon	 deaf	ears	amongst	 the
Saudi	population.	 And	 unless	Afghanistan	 moves	towards	 peace,	dozens	more
Bin	 Ladens	 are	ready	 and	 waiting	 to	 take	 his	 place	 from	 their	 bases	inside
Afghanistan.
       For	   Muslims	  everywhere	   Saudi	 support	  for	   the	  Taliban	  is	  deeply

260
embarrassing,	because	the	Taliban's	interpretation	  of	 Islam	is	 so	negative	 and
destructive.	Increasingly,	  Western	 popular	 perception	 equates	Islam	 with	  the
Taliban	 and	Bin	  Laden-style	 terrorism.	 Many	  Western	 commentators	do	 not
particularize	the	Taliban,	 but	condemn	Islam	 wholesale	for	 being	intolerant	 and
anti-modern.	The	 Taliban,	 like	 so	 many	 Islamic	 fundamentalist	 groups	today,
divest	Islam	of	 all	its	 legacies	except	theology	Islamic	 philosophy,	science,	arts,
aesthetics	and	mysticism	 are	ignored.	 Thus	the	rich	 diversity	  of	Islam	 and	the
essential	message	of	the	Koran	to	build	 a	civil	  society	that	is	 just	and	equitable
in	which	rulers	are	responsible	for	their	 citizens	–	is	forgotten.
       The	 genius	of	early	 Muslim-Arab	  civilization	 was	 its	multi-cultural,	  multi-
religious	 and	multi-ethnic	  diversity.	 The	 stunning	 and	numerous	state	failures
that	abound	 in	 the	 Muslim	  world	  today	 are	 because	that	original	  path,	 that
intention	  and	 inspiration,	   has	 been	 abandoned	 either	  in	  favour	  of	  brute
dictatorship	or	 a	narrow	 interpretation	 of	 theology.	 Muslim	 history	 has	been	a
cycle	of	conquest,	renewal	 and	defeat.	‘Perhaps	it	has	been	the	destiny	of	 Islam
to	attract	and	 use	the	primitive	 peoples	who	 surround	or	 cross	its	territory,	  but
then	to	fall	 prey	to	their	 violent	 power.	Ultimately	  order	is	restored	and	wounds
are	healed.	The	successful	primitive	 warrior	 is	tamed	 by	the	all-powerful	  urban
life	of	 Islam,’	wrote	 Ferdinand	Braudel.8
       Following	  this	Muslim	 tradition,	 could	the	Taliban	 also	change	or	moderate
their	 policies	 and	 absorb	 Afghanistan's	 rich	  ethnic	 and	 cultural	 diversity	  to
become	the	country's	legitimate	rulers?	In	their	present	form	that	is	unlikely.	  The
Taliban	are	essentially	 caught	between	a	tribal	 society	which	 they	try	 to	 ignore
and	 the	 need	 for	  a	 state	 structure	  which	  they	 refuse	 to	  establish.	 Tribal
fragmentation	amongst	 the	Pashtuns	is	 already	coming	 back	 to	haunt	 them	as
they	fail	 to	satisfy	 even	the	local	 demands	of	power-sharing,	 while	 they	ignore
the	non-Pashtuns.	This	 was	 never	the	 case	in	 the	 past.	‘Despite	  the	seeming
dominance	of	  the	Pashtuns,	 the	actual	 process	 of	 state-building	 entailed	 the
participation	of	 the	elite	of	 all	 the	ethnic	groups	and	a	prominent	 role	played	by
non-Pastuns	in	both	 the	 bureaucracy	and	 the	military,’	  writes	 Afghan	  scholar
Ashraf	 Ghani.9The	 Taliban	  are	bucking	  the	 entire	 trend	  of	 Afghan	  history
because	they	have	no	understanding	of	it.
       At	 the	same	time,	the	Taliban	refuse	to	define	the	Afghan	 state	they	want	to
constitute	and	rule	over,	largely	 because	they	have	no	idea	what	they	want.	 The
lack	of	a	central	 authority,	state	organizations,	a	methodology	 for	command	and
control	and	mechanisms	which	 can	reflect	 some	level	of	 popular	participatation
(Loya	 Jirga	 or	  Islamic	 Shura	 or	 parliament),	  make	 it	 impossible	  for	 many

261
Afghans	to	 accept	the	Taliban	 or	 for	 the	outside	 world	 to	recognize	 a	Taliban
government.	There	can	 be	no	effective	  government	unless	there	is	 a	common,
acceptable	definition	of	 what	kind	of	 state	is	now	required	to	heal	the	wounds	of
war.	But	 the	Kandahari	group	 around	Mullah	 Omar	brooks	 no	outsiders	and	no
advice.	Divisions	 within	  the	Taliban	 are	multiplying	  fast	 and	it	 is	not	 unlikely
that	more	 moderate	Taliban	 may	 mount	a	 coup	against	 Mullah	 Omar	 and	the
Kandahari	ulema.
       No	   warlord	  faction	  has	  ever	 felt	   itself	  responsible	  for	  the	 civilian
population,	but	 the	Taliban	 are	incapable	of	 carrying	out	 even	the	minimum	  of
developmental	work	 because	they	believe	that	Islam	will	  take	care	of	everyone.
This	has	raised	fundamental	questions	for	the	UN	 and	the	NGO	 community	that
humanitarian	aid	is	in	fact	 prolonging	the	civil	 war	 because	foreign	aid	keeps	the
population	 alive,	  absolving	 the	 warlords	  of	 the	  responsibility	  of	 having	  to
provide	for	 the	people	and	allowing	 them	 to	channel	all	 their	resources	into	 the
war	effort.	 This	 dilemma	is	 now	common	 for	the	 UN	and	aid	 agencies	in	other
failed	states	such	as	Sudan	and	 Somalia	and	presents	the	 greatest	challenge	to
the	international	humanitarian	community	 in	the	future.
       It	  seems	 that	 the	 only	  effective	  Afghan	  NGO	 is	  based	on	  organized
smuggling	 and	 the	 drugs	  trade.	 Thus	 the	 limited	  reconstruction	  which	 the
Taliban	has	undertaken	so	far	 is	 entirely	 related	to	improving	  the	efficiency	 of
smuggling	and	drugs	trafficking,	 such	as	repairing	roads,	setting	up	petrol	pumps
and	inviting	 US	 businessmen	to	set	up	a	 mobile	telephone	 network	which	 will
qualitatively	 speed	up	the	 movement	of	 drugs	and	illicit	  trade.	 The	benefits	 of
this	reconstruction	 all	 accrue	to	 the	 transport	and	 drugs	mafia.	 No	 warlord	 is
building	schools,	hospitals,	water	supply	 systems	or	anything	remotely	related	to
civic	development.
       In	 their	 present	form,	 the	Taliban	 cannot	hope	to	 rule	Afghanistan	 and	be
recognized	by	 the	international	 community.	  Even	if	  they	were	 to	 conquer	the
north,	it	  would	 not	 bring	 stability,	 only	  continuing	 guerrilla	 war	 by	 the	 non-
Pashtuns,	but	this	time	from	 bases	in	Central	Asia	and	Iran	which	 would	 further
destabilize	 the	  region.	 Yet	  in	  the	  Pashtun	 belt	 of	  Afghanistan,	  the	  only
alternative	to	the	Taliban	is	further	 disorder	and	chaos.	‘The	majority	 of	Afghans
south	of	 Kabul	 would	  most	probably	  agree	that	the	 Taliban,	 although	 not	 as
popular	today	 as	when	they	 came,	are	better	 for	the	 people,	their	 security	 and
welfare,	 compared	to	  what	 was	there	 before	 them	 and	 that	 there	is	 no	 real
alternative	but	anarchy.’10The	Taliban	cannot	be	wished	away,	but	a	more	likely
scenario	is	that	 the	Taliban	 will	  form	 factions	 with	 separate	and	rival	 Taliban

262
fiefdoms	in	Kabul,	 Kandahar	and	possibly	Herat.
       The	 anti-Taliban	  alliance	 is	 incapable	 of	 conquering	 or	 ruling	  over	 the
southern	Pashtun	region.	So	far	 Masud	has	proved	 unable	to	galvanize	 enough
Pashtuns	who	  reject	 the	 Taliban	  and	 who	  would	  give	 him	  some	 national
legitimacy.	 The	opposition's	 only	chance	for	 survival	 depends	on	winning	 over
sections	of	the	Pashtuns,	which	will	 doubtless	prolong	 the	war,	but	 also	weaken
the	Taliban	 and	offer	 the	 possibility	 that	 both	 sides	could	 then	negotiate.	The
anti-Taliban	 alliance	 has	also	 failed	 to	 set	 up	 minimum	 state	 structures	or	 a
representative	 leadership	 which	  absorbs	 even	  all	  the	 non-Pashtuns.	 Their
bickering,	 internal	 differences	 and	leadership	power	 struggles	 have	decimated
them	in	the	eyes	of	many	Afghans,	who	may	loathe	the	Taliban	 but	have	no	faith
in	the	anti-Taliban	alliance	either.
       The	 fear	 of	 fragmentation	  is	 ever	present	 and	the	 lines	 have	 been	well
drawn	since	1996	–	a	Pashtun	south	under	the	 Taliban	and	a	non-Pashtun	north
divided	by	the	Hindu	 Kush	mountains,	leaving	Kabul	 contested	by	the	two	sides.
With	 the	devastating	 massacres,	sectarian	pogroms	and	ethnic	 cleansing	in	 so
many	areas,	the	 chances	of	 fragmentation	 appear	extremely	 high.	 Fortunately
there	is	no	Slobodan	 Milosevic	 or	Saddam	Hussein	amongst	the	 warlords,	who
would	 be	 prepared	to	  preserve	power	 and	 their	 fiefdoms	  at	 the	 expense	of
partition	 of	the	 country.	 Despite	their	 interference,	fragmentation	 suits	none	 of
Afghanistan's	neighbours	because	it	would	open	a	Pandora's	box	of	ethnicity	that
would	rapidly	 spill	 across	Afghanistan's	borders,	create	massive	refugee	influxes
and	further	spread	the	culture	of	 drugs,	weapons	and	Islamic	fundamentalism	 in
their	 already	 fragile	 states.	Formal	  fragamentation	 and	 even	partition	  of	 the
Afghan	state	is	still	 possible,	but	 so	far	none	of	 the	players	desire	it.	That	 is	the
one	positive	hope	for	the	future	of	the	peace	process.
       Peace-making	by	 the	UN	 has	so	far	 failed	 to	 yield	 any	dividends,	 but	not
for	lack	 of	 trying.	 The	reason	is	simply	 that	 as	long	as	outside	powers	 fuel	the
warlords	with	 money	 and	weapons,	the	civil	 war	 does	not	have	a	 likelihood	 of
winding	 down.	A	 possible	solution	 might	 lie	 in	a	process	which	 would	 have	to
begin	from	outside	Afghanistan.	 All	 the	regional	 states	would	first	have	to	agree
to	an	arms	 embargo	on	Afghanistan,	 implement	 it	 sincerely	 and	allow	 it	 to	be
monitored	 by	 the	 UN	 effectively.	  The	 regional	  states	would	 have	 to	 accept
limited	 areas	of	influence	in	Afghanistan	 rather	than	continuing	 to	push	for	their
proxies	to	rule	 the	entire	country.	 An	 Iran-Pakistan	dialogue	would	 be	essential
in	which	 Pakistan	would	 accept	limiting	 its	 influence	to	 the	Pashtun	belt,	while
Iran	accept	the	same	in	western	and	central	Afghanistan	 with	 guarantees	for	the

263
Shia	minority.
       In	 short,	each	neighbouring	 state	would	have	to	recognize	not	 only	its	 own
national	 security	 needs,	 but	 also	 those	of	  its	 neighbours.	 Outside	 influence
cannot	now	be	eliminated	 in	 Afghanistan,	 but	it	 must	be	 contained	and	limited
with	 mutual	  agreement	 to	 acceptable	 levels.	 No	  neighbouring	  country	 can
presume	to	 undermine	 the	acknowledged	 security	 interests	 of	 its	 neighbours.
Negotiating	 such	 agreements	would	 be	 extremely	 tricky	  because	they	would
involve	 not	 just	 diplomats,	 but	 the	military	  and	 intelligence	 officials	  of	 each
state.	The	UN	 and	 the	international	 community	  would	 also	have	 to	 guarantee
that	 such	 agreements	would	  not	  be	 furthering	  the	 future	  disintegration	  of
Afghanistan	 or	 interfering	  with	  the	 process	of	 government	  formation	 inside
Afghanistan.
       Afghanistan's	  internal	 settlement	 can	no	 longer	 be	 achieved	 by	 what	 is
euphemistically	called	 ‘a	 broad-based	government.’	There	is	 no	possibility	  that
Mullah	 Omar	and	Masud	are	going	to	 be	able	to	agree	to	sit	down	in	 Kabul	 and
rule	together.	Instead,	what	is	needed	is	a	cease-fire,	a	weak	central	government
for	an	 initial	 period,	 the	agreed	demilitarization	 of	 Kabul	 and	a	high	 degree	of
autonomy	in	the	 regions	controlled	 by	the	factions.	 All	 the	factions	 would	 have
to	agree	to	build	 up	 a	strengthened	central	government	 in	the	 long	term,	 while
maintaining	their	 own	autonomy	in	the	short	term.	In	 this	way,	they	would	 retain
their	independent	military	  units,	but	 would	 also	contribute	 to	a	central	 policing
force	in	Kabul.
       The	factions	 would	receive	outside	aid	for	 reconstruction	on	an	independent
basis,	but	work	together	through	 the	central	government	to	 rebuild	 the	country's
shattered	infrastructure.	 This	  would	 in	  turn	 generate	greater	 confidence	 and
understanding	between	them.	All	 the	factions	would	 then	have	to	agree	to	set	in
motion	  some	  form	   of	   legitimizing	   process	  through	  elected	  or	   chosen
representative	bodies	in	 their	regions,	 which	 ultimately	 could	 lead	 to	a	central
Jirga	or	Shura	in	Kabul.
       It	  cannot	be	 underestimated	how	 difficult	   it	 would	 be	 to	 negotiate	such
agreements,	given	 that	 at	present	 there	is	 no	 will	  among	 the	 belligerents	 to
negotiate.	One	lure	could	be	a	substantial	reconstruction	package	put	together	by
international	donors,	the	World	 Bank	or	 large	private	charities,	which	 would	 not
be	disbursed	until	there	was	a	minimum	 agreement.	This	 would	essentially	 be	a
bribe	for	the	warlords	 and	an	incentive	for	 the	Afghan	people	to	pressurize	them
to	accept	 an	agreement.	Any	 serious	 peace	process	would	 need	much	 greater
commitment	to	 peace-making	in	Afghanistan	 from	 the	international	 community

264
than	it	has	shown	so	far.
       Peace	 in	 Afghanistan	  would	 pay	 enormous	 dividends	  across	the	 entire
region.	  Pakistan	 would	   benefit	  economically	   from	  the	  reconstruction	  in
Afghanistan	and	it	 could	 begin	to	 tackle	the	leftovers	 of	 the	Afghan	 war	 on	its
own	 soil	 the	proliferation	  of	 weapons,	 drugs,	terrorism,	  sectarianism	and	 the
black	economy.	 Pakistan's	diplomatic	 isolation	 in	 the	 region	would	 end	 and	it
could	reintegrate	itself	 into	 the	Central	 Asian	network	 of	 communication	 links,
offering	 as	it	does	the	shortest	route	to	the	sea.	Iran	would	 return	 to	its	position
in	the	world	community	 and	its	role	 as	a	great	trading	state	at	the	centre	of	South
Asia,	  Central	 Asia	  and	  the	 Middle	   East.	 Turkey	   would	  have	 links	  and
commercial	ties	to	 Turkic	 peoples	in	Afghanistan	 with	 whom	 it	 has	a	historical
connection.
       China	 would	 feel	 more	 secure	and	be	 able	to	 carry	 out	a	 more	 effective
economic	development	programme	in	its	deprived	 Muslim	 province	of	 Xinjiang.
Russia	could	 build	 a	 more	 realistic	 relationship	 with	 Central	 and	 South	Asia
based	on	economic	realities	rather	than	false	hegemonic	ambitions,	while	 laying
its	Afghan	 ghosts	to	rest.	Oil	 and	gas	pipelines	crossing	Afghanistan	would	 link
the	country	into	the	region	 and	speed	up	foreign	assistance	for	its	reconstruction.
The	USA	could	 evolve	a	more	realistic	 Central	Asian	 policy,	access	the	region's
energy	in	a	securer	environment	and	deal	with	the	threat	of	terrorism.
       But	 if	 the	war	 in	 Afghanistan	 continues	to	be	ignored	 we	can	 only	expect
the	 worst.	 Pakistan	 will	  face	 a	 Taliban-style	  Islamic	  revolution	  which	 will
further	destabilize	 it	and	 the	entire	region.	 Iran	will	  remain	on	the	 periphery	of
the	world	 community	  and	its	 eastern	borders	 will	 continue	 to	 be	wracked	 by
instability.	 The	Central	 Asian	states	will	 not	 be	able	to	deliver	 their	 energy	and
mineral	exports	 by	 the	shortest	routes	 and	as	their	 economies	crash,	they	 will
face	an	 Islamic	 upsurge	 and	 instability.	  Russia	will	   continue	 to	 bristle	 with
hegemonic	aims	in	Central	Asia	 even	as	its	own	society	and	economy	crumbles.
The	stakes	are	extremely	high.

                         THE	    TALIBAN	         RESURGENT
                                                2000-2009



	
When	 the	 19	 suicide	bombers	rammed	their	 planes	into	 the	 buildings	in
Washington,	DC,	and	New	York	City	on	11	September	2001,	it	was	the	end	of
an	era	for	the	West.	The	innocence	of	the	post-Cold	War	period	–	the	belief	that
global	political	threats	had	now	subsided	and	we	could	all	get	on	with	our	lives	–
came	to	an	 abrupt	end.	Terrorist	attacks	by	 Muslim	 extremists,	Westerners
discovered,	did	not	just	take	place	in	distant	lands	against	unknown	people;	they
threatened	the	heartland	of	the	West.	In	Central	and	South	Asia,	however,	the
Western	retaliation	to	the	attacks	brought	the	hope	that	the	Taliban	regime	would
be	overthrown,	finally	bringing	an	end	to	the	long-running	wars	in	Afghanistan
that	had	begun	with	the	Soviet	invasion	in	1979.	The	war	against	the	Taliban
ushered	in	the	promise	of	peace	and	reconstruction	in	Afghanistan	and	across	the
region.
       The	 brutal	  deterioration	of	  the	  social	 and	 economic	 conditions	 in
Afghanistan	under	the	sway	of	the	 Taliban	and	Al	 Qaeda	in	the	18	 months
before	11	September	should	have	signalled	to	the	world	that	enormous	dangers
were	lurking	there	as	Afghanistan	became	a	terrorist	sanctuary	for	Osama	Bin
Laden	and	some	2,500	of	his	fighters.	Extremists	from	South	and	Central	Asia,
the	Middle	East,	the	Far	East,	Africa	and	even	Europe	poured	into	Al	Qaeda
camps	to	 receive	training	 in	 battlefield	 tactics,	bomb	 making	and	 making
poisons.
       In	the	nine	months	before	September	2001	the	international	community	had
tried	to	tighten	restrictions	on	the	Taliban,	but	the	measures	were	insufficient	to
control	the	regime	 or	its	 Al	  Qaeda	allies.	On	19	 January	the	UN	 Security
Council	passed	Resolution	1333,	which	imposed	sanctions	on	the	Taliban	that
included	a	 complete	arms	 ban	 and	the	 seizure	of	  Taliban	 assets	outside
Afghanistan.	The	Taliban	were	furious,	as	there	was	no	similar	arms	ban	on	the
Taliban's	opposition,	the	United	Front	(now	called	the	Northern	Alliance	or	NA).
Pakistan's	Interservices	Intelligence	defied	the	ban	by	continuing	to	provide	the
Taliban	with	weapons,	and	the	UN	was	forced	to	pass	another	resolution	in	July
putting	greater	pressure	on	Islamabad	to	stop	supplying	them	with	arms.

267
       As	 a	result	 of	these	sanctions	both	 Pakistan	and	the	Taliban	 became	more
isolated	from	the	world	 community,	but	the	sanctions	themselves	seemed	to	have
little	 other	effect.	Pakistan's	military	 regime,	led	by	 President	Pervez	Musharraf,
mobilized	 national	 Islamic	 parties	 to	 hold	 anti-American	 and	 anti-UN	 rallies,
while	it	 continued	 to	support	the	Taliban,	 which	 was	now	 also	being	helped	by
Al	Qaeda.
       As	  pressure	 mounted	  on	 the	  Taliban,	  the	 moderate	  wing	  within	  its
leadership	–	who	despised	the	Arabs,	was	opposed	to	international	terrorism,	and
was	secretly	willing	 to	negotiate	with	 the	United	 Nations	and	others	–	suffered	a
major	setback	when	their	leader,	Mullah	 Mohammed	 Rabbani,	died	of	 cancer	in
a	Karachi	hospital	on	16	 April.	 Rabbani	was	the	de	facto	second	in	command	of
the	Taliban	and	had	strongly	 opposed	the	growing	influence	 of	the	Arabs	on	 the
movement.	With	 Rabbani	gone,	Al	 Qaeda	persuaded	Mullah	Mohammed	 Omar
to	issue	extreme	edicts	imposing	mandates	that	were	unrelated	to	Afghan	culture
and	tradition.	Over	a	few	 weeks	the	Taliban	ordered	the	closing	down	 of	foreign
hospitals,	declared	that	 all	Afghan	 Hindus	 would	 have	to	 wear	yellow	  badges,
banned	the	Internet,	put	eight	Western	humanitarian	 workers	on	trial	 and	forced
the	UN's	World	 Food	Programme	to	shut	down	its	 bakeries,	which	had	provided
affordable	bread	to	millions	 of	hungry	people.
       With	 the	support	of	 some	2,500	Arab	fighters	 the	Taliban	also	attempted	to
seize	the	last	 slivers	 of	 territory	 held	 by	 the	NA	  and	its	 leader,	Ahmad	 Shah
Masud.	The	Taliban	first	 conquered	the	Hazarajat	in	central	 Afghanistan	and,	as
punishment	to	 the	 resisting	 Hazaras,	who	 were	 Shia	 Muslims,	 Mullah	  Omar
ordered	the	destruction	of	 the	two	 enormous	statues	of	the	Buddha	 in	Bamiyan
that	had	stood	for	1,800	years.	They	were	blown	up	by	dynamite	and	tank	fire	 on
10	March,	causing	international	 outrage.	As	the	Hazaras	fed	their	homeland,	 the
drought	 and	 the	 war	 intensified,	  turning	 more	 than	 a	 million	   Afghans	 into
refugees	within	their	 own	country.	 Many	 Afghans	were	reduced	to	eating	 grass,
rodents	and	animal	fodder,	and	Afghan	girls	were	sold	to	buy	food.
       On	 the	 eve	of	 11	 September	it	 was	 self-evident	 to	 the	few	  international
actors	who	paid	attention	to	Afghanistan	 that	with	 Al	Qaeda	firmly	 ensconced	in
the	country,	a	hopelessly	inept	Taliban	 regime	in	 charge	of	it,	and	drought,	 civil
war,	mass	migrations	and	drug	trafficking	 ravaging	it	 the	stage	had	been	set	for	a
major	international	crisis.
       Al	 Qaeda	had	prepared	for	the	11	September	attacks	well.	Two	 days	earlier
Ahmad	Shah	Masud	had	been	assassinated.	Two	young	Moroccans	pretending	to
be	journalists	who	had	been	recruited	by	Al	Qaeda	in	Belgium	 had	blown	him	up

268
with	a	suicide	 bomb	packed	into	a	television	 camera.	Al	 Qaeda	had	planned	the
assassination	for	several	weeks	earlier,	 which	 would	 have	allowed	 the	Taliban
time	to	defeat	the	NA,	 leaving	them	in	 control	 of	the	entire	country	 when	the	11
September	attacks	occurred.	This	 would	 have	left	 any	invading	 force	 bereft	 of
allies	on	the	ground.	The	murder	 of	Masud	was	to	 be	Osama	Bin	Laden's	gift	 to
Mullah	  Omar	 and	 a	 guarantee	 of	  Al	  Qaeda's	continued	  safe	 sanctuary	 in
Afghanistan	despite	the	inevitable	US	retaliation.
       Within	   days	of	  the	 attacks	 President	George	 W.	  Bush	 announced	that
America	 was	now	 at	 war	 with	 international	  terrorists	and	 declared	a	 state	of
emergency	in	the	USA.	 The	world	 rallied	 around	the	USA	as	NATO	 pledged	to
support	any	military	 action	Washington	 might	take.	On	 15	September,	President
Musharraf	was	given	an	ultimatum	 by	President	Bush	(“you	 are	either	with	us	or
against	us”),	and	the	military	  regime	immediately	 decided	to	switch	 sides,	from
helping	 the	Taliban	 to	 supporting	 the	US	 invasion	 of	 Afghanistan	 that	 would
destroy	it.	 The	reason,	as	Musharraf	 stated,	was	that	 any	other	 response	could
have	led	 to	 the	bombing	 of	 Pakistan,	 threats	to	 its	 nuclear	 facilities,	 and	 the
creation	of	 US	 military	  bases	in	 neighbouring	 India,	 Pakistan's	 long-standing
enemy.	The	Islamic	right	erupted	in	 anger	at	the	decision,	but	Musharraf	held	his
ground.
       Mullah	  Omar	rallied	 the	Taliban	 to	defy	the	 USA	and	refused	all	 demands
that	he	 give	 up	 power	 or	 surrender	Osama	 Bin	 Laden	 and	 Al	 Qaeda	to	 the
Americans.	 The	 ISI	 made	 several	unsuccessful	 attempts	 to	 persuade	Mullah
Omar	to	surrender	Bin	 Laden	and	save	his	regime,	but	Omar	refused,	though	he
knew	the	 Taliban	 leaders	were	 deeply	divided	  on	the	 issue,	and	he	 faced	the
possibility	 of	a	revolt	from	 within	 his	own	ranks.	Omar	was	also	bolstered	by	the
reassurance	from	his	supporters	in	 Pakistan	and	Al	  Qaeda	that	the	USA	 might
launch	a	bombing	 campaign	–	 which	 the	Taliban	 could	 survive	–	 but	it	 would
never	send	ground	troops	into	Afghanistan.
       The	 USA	was	certainly	 reluctant	to	put	many	troops	on	the	ground,	wary	 of
becoming	 embroiled	 in	  the	 same	 morass	that	 had	 led	  to	 the	 failed	  Soviet
occupation	in	 the	1980s.	Instead,	the	 CIA	 head,	George	Tenet,	put	 together	an
audacious	plan	in	 which	 NA	 Afghan	 forces	on	 the	ground	 would	 link	 up	 with
teams	of	 CIA	  and	 US	 Special	 Operations	Forces.	 The	 NA	  would	 help	 find
targets	for	US	 air	 power,	which	 in	 turn	 would	 support	NA	 ground	 attacks.	US
infantry	 would	  never	 be	 heavily	 involved	  in	  ground	 attacks.	 The	 US	 State
Department	began	to	secure	bases	in	Central	Asia,	Pakistan	and	the	Persian	Gulf
for	use	by	US	forces	as	aircraft	carriers	arrived	off	 the	shores	of	Pakistan.

269
       On	  7	  October,	 Operation	  Enduring	  Freedom’	  began	 with	  heavy	  US
bombing	raids	on	Taliban	 bases	and	infrastructure	across	the	country,	as	well	as
against	the	50,000	Taliban	 troops	massed	outside	Kabul	 who	were	 defending	a
long	front	 line	 against	NA	 forces.	Four	 weeks	of	 bombing	 followed	 before	the
first	NA	 breakthrough	occurred,	on	 9	November,	with	 the	fall	 of	Mazar-e-Sharif
in	 the	north	 to	 the	 Uzbek	 and	 Tajik	 forces	 of	 Generals	 Rashid	Dostum	 and
Mohammed	Atta.	 The	Taliban	were	routed,	and	within	 the	next	 three	days	all	of
northern,	western	and	central	Afghanistan	fell	to	 the	NA.	As	the	Taliban	 fed	they
were	pounded	mercilessly	from	the	air	 by	US	aircraft,	 and	many	were	killed	 and
wounded.	 Meanwhile,	   CIA	   money	  had	 persuaded	 many	  of	  the	  Pashtun
commanders	to	switch	sides	and	abandon	the	Taliban.1
       Having	 lost	 the	north,	 the	Taliban	 next	 abandoned	Kabul	 and	retreated	to
their	southern	headquarters	of	Kandahar,	while	 several	thousand	still	held	out	 in
the	Pashtun	enclave	of	 Kunduz	 in	 the	 far	north	 east.	Also	 trapped	 in	 Kunduz
were	dozens	of	Pakistani	 ISI	officers	 who	 had	remained	behind	 in	Afghanistan
to	 help	 the	Taliban.	  In	 mid-November,	  at	 the	special	 request	 of	 Musharraf,
President	Bush	allowed	 the	Pakistani	air	 force	to	 carry	 out	an	airlift	  over	three
nights	to	bring	out	ISI	 officers.	Along	 with	 them	the	Pakistanis	saved	the	lives	of
many	leading	 Taliban	 and	 Central	 Asian	 militants,	 and	 even	some	 Al	 Qaeda
members.	Thousands	 of	  remaining	 Taliban	  fighters	  were	 killed	  or	 died	  as
prisoners	of	war	after	surrendering	to	General	Dostum.
       Mullah	   Omar	 surrendered	 Kandahar	  on	 5	  December,	 but	  he	 himself
escaped	into	the	 desert	on	a	 motorbike.	 By	 then	most	 of	 the	Taliban	 had	 left
Kandahar	for	the	safety	of	their	 villages	or	neighbouring	 Baluchistan	province	in
Pakistan.	Al	Qaeda	leaders,	including	 Bin	Laden,	who	 held	out	for	 a	time	in	 the
Tora	Bora	mountains	in	eastern	Afghanistan,	also	escaped	by	crossing	the	border
into	 Pakistan's	tribal	 agencies.	The	 USA	  had	failed	 to	 stop	 this	 mass	escape
because	Washington	had	refused	to	deploy	American	ground	forces	 in	the	battle
and	instead	had	relied	upon	local	NA	 militias	 to	 keep	the	enemy	from	escaping.
It	was	the	biggest	mistake	of	the	war.
       According	  to	military	  officers	 I	spoke	 with	 several	months	later	in	 Kabul,
the	Taliban	had	lost	 some	8,000	to	12,000	men,	 20	per	cent	of	 their	total	 force,
with	 an	estimated	twice	 that	number	 wounded	and	 some	7,000	taken	prisoner.
But	although	they	 were	seriously	damaged,	they	were	not	defeated:	almost	 their
entire	leadership	structure	 remained	intact,	 and	the	 survivors	 had	been	able	 to
escape	and	reorganize	in	Pakistan.
       The	 war	had	gone	faster	than	 anyone	could	have	predicted,	but	 along	with

270
military	 success	came	the	growing	realization	that	the	business	of	forming	a	new
government	in	  Kabul	 had	 been	left	  behind.	 The	 UN,	 under	 the	 auspices	of
Ambassador	Lakhdar	 Brahimi	  and	his	 deputy	 Francesc	Vendrell,	 organized	 a
conference	near	Bonn	of	 various	Afghan	 groups	 in	order	 to	try	 to	 work	 out	an
agreement	about	 forming	  the	 next	  government	 in	  Kabul.	 Although	   several
Afghan	groups	 were	represented,	the	dominant	faction	 was	 the	NA,	 which	 had
emerged	as	the	military	 victor.	 The	Pashtun	tribes	were	underrepresented	at	the
conference,	and	the	Taliban	were	not	represented	at	all.
       The	 meeting	began	on	27	November,	and	after	lengthy,	 all-night	 wrangling
it	ended	on	5	 December	when	Hamid	 Karzai,	a	prominent	 Pashtun	tribal	 leader
from	 Kandahar	who	 had	 remained	 loyal	 to	 the	faction	  of	 former	 King	 Zahir
Shah,	was	elected	as	the	future	 interim	 President	of	Afghanistan.	 Karzai	 was	a
moderate	politician,	rather	than	a	warlord,	 and	in	the	early	1990s	he	had	actually
supported	the	Taliban	 from	his	 base	in	Quetta.	But	 he	had	turned	 against	them
and	 started	 to	  organize	  the	 overthrow	  of	  the	  Taliban	  regime	  after	  they
assassinated	his	father	in	1999.	Following	 the	11	September	attacks,	Karzai	was
one	of	the	few	Pashtun	commanders	who	took	the	risk	of	 going	into	Afghanistan
to	 rally	  the	 Pashtuns	against	 the	 Taliban.	 Once	 inside	 Afghanistan	  he	 was
quickly	helped	by	the	CIA,	 who	supplied	 him	with	 weapons,	food	and	advisers.2
       The	 Bonn	  agreement	signed	 on	 6	 December	called	 for	  ‘a	 broad-based,
gender-sensitive,	multi-ethnic	 and	fully	 representative	government’,	 the	holding
of	 an	 emergency	 Loya	 Jirga	 by	 June	 2002	 that	 would	  decide	upon	  a	new
transitional	 government	and	 presidential	and	 parliamentary	 elections	to	 follow
later.	Then	 a	 constitutional	 Loya	  Jirga	 would	 be	 summoned	to	 adopt	 a	new
constitution	by	2003.	Former	 King	 Zahir	Shah	was	to	be	given	the	title	Father	of
the	Nation.	The	Bonn	agreement	was	not	a	peace	treaty:	the	vanquished	were	not
represented,	and	it	made	no	 provision	 for	 a	cease-fire	or	the	 demobilization	 of
forces.	Brahimi	  and	Vendrell	  were	later	 to	 regret	 that	 there	were	 no	Taliban
present	or	 that,	 since	they	 had	 not	 been,	the	 UN	 had	 not	held	 a	 subsequent
conference	at	which	  the	Taliban	 would	  have	been	represented.	Yet	 given	 the
rushed	circumstances	–	 the	 quick,	 unexpected	end	 to	 the	war,	 the	 dangerous
political	 vacuum	 in	 Kabul,	 the	 late	 realization	 in	 Washington	 that	an	 interim
government	would	 be	 necessary	–	and	the	desire	 by	all	 the	 outside	players	 to
prevent	a	full-scale	  foreign	 occupation,	the	 Bonn	 agreement	was	the	 best	and
least	contentious	compromise	possible.
       It	 soon	became	apparent	that	the	Bush	administration	had	no	great	desire	to
rebuild	 Afghanistan	 or	 even	 to	 provide	 sufficient	  troops	 for	 its	 security	 and

271
recovery.	Within	  weeks	 of	 winning	  the	war	 in	  Afghanistan,	 US	 troops	 were
training	for	 the	invasion	 of	Iraq,	 and	US	Special	Operations	Forces	were	pulled
out	 of	  key	 locations	  in	  Afghanistan	  where	 they	 were	  hunting	  Al	  Qaeda.
Afghanistan	fell	 victim	 to	 the	Bush	strategy	of	 preserving	US	resources,	money
and	troops	 for	 Iraq.	 In	 Afghanistan,	 in	 order	 to	 minimize	 their	 exposure,	 the
Americans	cut	 deals	with	 the	 newly	 installed	 NA	 warlords	 –	 even	though	 the
majority	 of	these	had	participated	 in	the	1990s	civil	  war	and	were	 hated	by	the
population.
       According	  to	US	officials	  in	Kabul	 who	 were	opposed	to	the	policy,	 these
warlords	and	their	 militias	 were	 funded	by	 the	CIA	 and	told	 to	 keep	the	peace
outside	 Kabul	 and	 hunt	  down	 Al	  Qaeda	 members.	Rapacious,	 corrupt	  and
ruthless,	the	 militias	  terrorized	 the	population	  and	eventually	  went	into	  drug
trafficking	  and	other	illicit	   businesses.	In	May	 2002	 Democratic	 Senator	(and
later	Vice	 President)	Joseph	Biden	issued	a	dire	warning:	 America	 has	replaced
the	Taliban	with	 the	warlords….	We	are	actually	making	 them	the	centrepiece	of
our	strategy’.3	But	 US	Secretary	of	 Defense	Donald	Rumsfield	 insisted	that	 the
strategy	of	having	 the	warlords	 share	power	with	 the	government	 was	the	right
one.
       The	 Loya	Jirga	 held	in	June	2002	resulted	in	 the	election	 of	Hamid	 Karzai
as	interim	 President,	but	 the	euphoria	 created	around	the	 country	by	 the	 Jirga
never	 translated	 into	 improvements	  on	 the	 ground	  because	of	  the	 lack	 of
resources	available	to	the	new	interim	 government.	There	were	barely	 sufficient
US	troops	 to	 patrol	the	 cities,	 let	 alone	the	 countryside,	and	 it	 took	 the	USA
some	time	to	recognize	the	need	to	train	 a	professional	Afghan	 army	and	police
force.	Likewise,	 the	Afghans’	 hopes	that	billions	 of	 US	dollars	 would	 flow	 into
the	country	 to	 rebuild	 the	infrastructure,	 create	 jobs,	invest	 in	 agriculture	 and
industry	and	provide	 incentives	for	 the	Taliban	to	return	 home	and	live	in	 peace
with	 them	  were	 blighted	  by	 the	 lack	  of	 US	  funding	  and	 attention	 to	  the
problems.
       After	  considerable	 pressure	was	exerted	 on	the	 USA	 by	 close	 European
allies	who	 insisted	that	 a	multinational	 peace-keeping	force	 was	necessary	at	a
minimum	 for	Kabul,	 if	 not	the	country,	Rumsfield	 reluctantly	 gave	his	approval.
A	number	of	European	countries	formed	 a	peace-keeping	force,	the	International
Security	 Assistance	Force	 (ISAF),	  to	help	 out	 in	 Kabul.	  Consisting	 of	 some
5,000	soldiers	drawn	from	 more	than	20	 countries,	the	ISAF	 was	never	allowed
to	expand	to	 other	cities	 despite	incessant	pleas	that	 they	 do	so	from	 Lakhdar
Brahimi	   and	  Francesc	  Vendrell,	   who	   was	  now	   the	  European	   Union

272
representative	in	Kabul,	 as	well	as	from	 President	Karzai.	 The	UN	 tried	to	 start
disarming	the	hundreds	of	 thousands	of	men	who	 made	up	the	Afghan	 militias,
but	the	efforts	moved	very	slowly,	 largely	because	of	the	lack	of	US	support.
       Meanwhile,	  the	Taliban,	  its	senior	 leadership	intact,	 had	 been	welcomed
back	to	 Pakistan	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 former	  supporters.	Many	 Taliban	  members
returned	 to	 their	 families,	  who	  still	  lived	 in	  refugee	 camps	 in	 Baluchistan
province;	others	returned	to	 the	Pakistani	madrassas	from	 which	 they	had	been
recruited;	 while	 senior	 figures	 were	 welcomed	 by	 the	ISI	  and	the	 provincial
governments	of	the	North	West	Frontier	Province	 and	Baluchistan.
       The	  Pakistani	 military	   rigged	  the	 general	 elections	  of	  2002,	 keeping
Benazir	 Bhutto	 and	Nawaz	 Sharif,	 the	 leaders	 of	 the	two	  main	 parties	from
taking	part.	 But	although	 there	was	huge	public	 opposition	 to	the	news	of	 both
the	rigging	and	the	fact	 that	the	two	 leaders	had	been	kept	out,	as	a	result	of	the
military's	 actions	 the	 elections	in	 the	 two	 border	 provinces	 with	 Afghanistan
were	won	 by	 the	Jamiat-e-Ulema	 Islam	 party,	the	 same	party	 that	had	helped
launch	the	 Taliban	 in	 1994,	 whose	 members	believed	 in	 the	 strict	 Deobandi
interpretation	of	Islam.	 The	JUI	once	again	offered	its	support	to	the	Taliban.
       Taliban	 members	who	 had	originally	  returned	to	 their	destitute	 villages	in
Afghanistan	also	soon	arrived	in	Pakistan,	looking	 for	jobs	and	financial	 support.
A	 few	 Taliban	 commanders	surrendered	to	 US	 forces,	 but	they	 were	 harshly
treated	and	then	packed	off	to	the	prison	camp	for	terrorists	 at	Guantánamo	Bay,
the	US	 naval	base	on	 Cuba.	The	 USA	 made	no	 attempt	to	 negotiate	with	 the
Pashtuns	or	the	 Taliban,	 and	the	 Pashtuns	distrusted	 the	Americans	 from	 the
start.	As	US	bombing	 of	Taliban	 hideouts	and	targets	in	Afghanistan	 continued,
killing	 many	civilians	 in	 the	process,	the	Pashtuns’	anger	against	the	Americans
increased.	Matters	were	not	helped	by	the	fact	 that	US	forces	tended	to	 view	all
Pashtuns	as	potential	  Taliban	 supporters.	 The	 Pashtun	concentrations	 in	 the
southern	and	eastern	regions	became	increasingly	 alienated,	a	 disaffection	 that
was	soon	exploited	by	the	revived	Taliban	movement.
       Mullah	  Omar,	 who	 had	been	hiding	 out	 in	 Helmand	 province,	arrived	 in
Quetta	in	 the	 winter	 of	 2002.	 Taking	 key	 figures	 from	 the	 former	 regime	 to
create	a	new	 Taliban	 Shura,	 Omar	appointed	 four	 commanders	 to	reorganize
resistance	in	 the	four	 southern	 provinces	 of	 Afghanistan	 (Uruzgan,	 Helmand,
Kandahar	 and	 Zabul).	 These	 figures	  were	 Mullah	  Obaidullah	  Akhund,	  the
former	Defence	Minister;	  Mullah	 Akthar	 Mohammed	Usmani,	 the	former	 army
chief;	Mullah	 Dadullah,	the	one-legged	corps	commander	who	had	destroyed	the
statues	of	the	Buddha;	 and	former	 Interior	 Minister	  Mullah	 Abdul	 Razaq.	The

273
four	  began	 to	  raise	  funds	  in	  Karachi	  and	  Quetta	  from	  supporters	 and
sympathizers,	and	particularly	 from	 the	Deobandi	madrassas,	and	they	received
considerable	backing	from	 the	JUI-led	 provincial	  governments.	Moreover,	 they
travelled	to	the	Persian	Gulf	and	Saudi	Arabia	 and	revived	their	contacts	there	in
order	 to	 enlist	 more	  Arab	 donations	 for	  their	 cause	 to	 fight	  US	 forces	 in
Afghanistan.
       In	 eastern	Afghanistan	and	in	the	seven	tribal	 agencies	in	northern	Pakistan
known	as	the	Federal	Administered	 Tribal	Agencies	 (FATA),	 the	reorganization
was	led	by	separate	groups	allied	to	the	Taliban.	The	major	group	was	headed	by
the	former	 Taliban	 Minister	 of	 Tribal	 Affairs,	 Jalaluddin	 Haqqani,	 and	his	son
Sirajuddin,	 who	 operated	out	of	 Miranshah	 in	 North	 Waziristan.	 The	 two	had
especially	close	ties	to	both	Al	 Qaeda	and	the	ISI.	 Other	groups	were	led	by	 the
veteran	Pashtun	Islamist	Gulbuddin	 Hikmetyar,	 who	 arrived	from	 exile	 in	 Iran,
and	Saifur	Rahman	Mansur,	 who	 had	led	the	Taliban	 and	Arab	 forces	in	 battle
against	the	Americans	in	the	 mountains	near	Gardez	in	the	spring	offensive	 that
the	USA	  dubbed	Operation	 Anaconda’.	  The	battle	 had	 raged	for	  two	 weeks
before	the	Taliban	retreated	into	Pakistan.
       The	 Pakistan	 army	had	 stopped	deploying	 troops	 around	 FATA	  in	 early
2002	because	of	 the	build	 up	 of	 tensions	with	 India	 after	 the	storming	 of	 the
Indian	parliament	 by	 Kashmiri	 militants.	 For	 much	of	 that	 year	problems	with
India	 preoccupied	the	army	 and	 allowed	 Al	 Qaeda	to	 move	 around	at	 will	 in
FATA,	  forging	  new	 allies	  among	 the	 local	  Pakistani	 Pashtun	 tribes.	 Arab
militants	 married	  into	 the	 tribes	 while	  at	 the	 same	time	 helping	  revive	 the
Afghan	Taliban	with	 training,	 funding	and	supplies	of	weapons.
       Meanwhile,	 the	ISI	 continued	funnelling	 clandestine	support	to	the	Taliban,
owing	  to	 the	  Pakistani	 army's	  fear	 that	  by	  backing	  the	 US	  invasion	  of
Afghanistan,	it	 had	 helped	bring	 to	 power	the	 NA,	 whom	 the	military	  loathed
because	the	NA	received	support	from	 Pakistan's	regional	rivals	 India,	 Iran	and
Russia.	(Most	of	the	important	 ministries	in	 the	Karzai	government	were	held	by
the	NA.)	 The	 army	 was	also	deeply	 perturbed	by	 the	sudden	infux	  of	 Indians
into	Kabul,	 fearing	that	India	 would	now	 attempt	to	destabilize	Pakistan	through
its	western	 border.	 By	 stoking	 up	 the	conflict	  with	 India,	 the	 army	 hoped	to
enlist	US	support	in	bringing	 about	a	final	settlement	of	 the	Kashmir	dispute,	but
the	Bush	administration	had	little	 interest	in	 doing	so.	Already	 preoccupied	with
plans	 to	 invade	 Iraq,	  the	 administration	  wanted	 only	  to	  stabilize	 relations
between	India	and	Pakistan.
       Once	 Musharraf	  and	the	 army	 realized	 that	 President	 Bush	intended	 to

invade	Iraq,	 they	 assumed	that	the	 USA	 would	  pull	 out	 of	 Afghanistan	 soon
thereafter;	at	the	least	Washington	 would	 refuse	to	 commit	 sufficient	 resources
to	that	country.	Pakistan	would	be	left	 with	Afghanistan	 on	its	hands,	as	it	was	in
1989	 after	 the	 Soviets	  and	 then	 the	 USA	  withdrew	  from	  the	 region.	  For
Musharraf	it	 seemed	better	to	 hold	 the	Taliban	 in	 reserve	as	a	proxy	 force	for
Pakistan.	 The	  lack	  of	  trust	  between	 the	  Pakistani	  military	   and	 the	  US
government	helped	fuel	the	revival	of	 the	Taliban	movement.
       Nevertheless	the	 ISI	 did	move	 against	Al	 Qaeda,	arresting	several	leading
figures	 who	  were	 hiding	  out	  in	  Pakistani	 cities,	  including	  Khalid	  Sheikh
Mohammed,	the	planner	of	 the	11	September	attacks,	and	Abu	Zubaydah,	a	key
recruiter	for	 Al	 Qaeda.	In	retaliation	Al	 Qaeda	enlisted	local	 Pakistani	extremist
groups	to	 assassinate	Musharraf.	Two	 unsuccessful	suicide	attacks	 were	made
against	him	in	December	2003,	 but	they	failed	 to	convince	the	Pakistan	military
that	the	 country	 now	 faced	a	growing	  threat	at	 home	from	 the	 alliance	 of	 Al
Qaeda,	the	growing	Pakistani	Taliban,	and	the	Afghan	Taliban.
       After	  stockpiling	 weapons	inside	Afghanistan	 during	the	winter	 of	 2002-3,
the	Taliban	 launched	 their	 first	 guerrilla	  attacks	in	 the	 southern	provinces	 of
Kandahar,	Zabul	and	Helmand	 –	all	 adjacent	to	Pakistan.	The	 first	 major	battle
against	US	forces	took	place	in	January	2003	when	a	US	patrol	surprised	a	group
of	some	80	Taliban	 members	near	Spin	Baldak	in	Kandahar	 province.	In	 March
the	Afghan	 nation	 and	 the	international	 community	  realized	the	 extent	 of	 the
new	Taliban	 threat	when	 a	Salvadorian	engineer	belonging	 to	 the	International
Committee	of	 the	Red	 Cross	was	executed	in	 cold	blood	 after	 his	convoy	 was
halted	by	a	Taliban	group	in	Uruzgan	province	 on	27	March.
       Over	  the	 next	 few	  weeks	 several	 more	 aid	  workers	 –	 foreigners	  and
Afghans	 alike	 –	were	 killed,	  indicating	 that	 the	Taliban	 had	 no	 compunction
about	 killing	  civilians.	   The	 Bush	 administration	  was	 preoccupied	 with	  the
invasion	of	 Iraq,	and	in	 Washington	 there	was	little	 importance	 given	to	 small,
localized	 attacks	in	 Afghanistan.	 In	 the	late	 summer,	however,	 US	 forces	 did
launch	a	large	offensive	in	 Zabul	province,	 and	they	were	shocked	when	instead
of	feeling,	the	Taliban	 stood	and	fought	them	for	nine	 days,	despite	intensive	US
air	attacks.	By	autumn	the	Taliban	 had	established	almost	complete	control	over
Zabul	and	Helmand	provinces	and	set	up	supply	lines	from	Pakistan.
       In	 those	critical	 days	when	the	Taliban	were	far	 from	popular	 and	had	little
political	 control	across	the	south,	even	a	few	more	US	troops	could	 have	made	a
huge	difference	 in	stemming	 the	incipient	  insurgency.	But	 insofar	 as	the	USA
paid	any	attention	 to	Afghanistan,	 it	 was	to	focus	on	 killing	 Osama	Bin	 Laden,

275
rather	 than	  on	  stabilizing	   the	  countryside,	  rebuilding	   the	 economy	  and
infrastructure	or	even	dealing	with	 the	Taliban	as	a	serious	threat.
       That	 any	 progress	occurred	 on	the	 political	  front	 was	 largely	 due	to	 the
efforts	of	 the	UN,	which	 helped	the	Pashtuns	gain	greater	power	and	bring	 their
political	 isolation	 to	an	end.	Winning	 the	Pashtuns	over	would	 now	 be	a	matter
of	offering	  them	economic	 development,	jobs,	 good	governance	and	 above	all
US	 funding	  –	 which	  was	 not	 being	 made	 available.	 The	  two	 Loya	  Jirgas
organized	by	 the	UN	  –	the	 first	 in	 June	2002	 which	 chose	Karzai	 as	 interim
President	and	 the	 second	in	  the	 winter	 of	  2003	 which	 agreed	 upon	 a	 new
constitution	 –	  had	 both	 helped	  bring	 the	  Pashtuns	back	  into	 the	  political
mainstream.
       It	 was	 not	surprising	 that	the	 return	of	 the	 Taliban	coincided	 with	 a	huge
spurt	 of	  opium	  production	  in	 the	  south.	 The	  Taliban	 had	  banned	 opium
production	for	a	year	in	2000	because	overproduction	had	led	to	a	collapse	of	the
price	of	 heroin.	After	 11	 September,	therefore,	only	 some	of	the	farmers	 in	the
south	were	growing	poppies	for	 opium	and	heroin	production.	 And,	indeed,	after
11	 September	 most	  of	  them	 would	  have	  welcomed	 the	  chance	 to	 grow
something	else,	but	 they	had	no	 alternative	seeds	or	 fertilizer,	 and	the	 drought
had	seriously	depleted	the	water	supply.	As	they	awaited	the	promised	American
aid	that	never	materialized,	farmers	 in	the	winter	 of	2001-2	 began	once	again	to
plant	the	only	seed	they	had	–	poppy.	The	 Taliban	soon	reappeared	in	the	south,
once	more	taxing	farmers	on	their	 poppy	crop	 while	at	the	same	time	promising
to	protect	them	against	any	government	moves	to	eradicate	it.
       In	 2004	–	the	 first	full	  year	of	the	Taliban	 insurgency	–	some	4,200	metric
tonnes	of	opium	 were	harvested	compared	with	 3,600	tonnes	the	previous	year,
representing	a	 64	 per	cent	 increase.	 In	 its	 annual	 report	 the	United	  Nations
Office	of	 Drugs	and	Crime	 estimated	that	opium	was	now	being	 grown	in	 all	34
provinces	and	that	2.3	million	 Afghans	(14	per	cent	of	the	rural	 population)	were
involved	 in	harvesting	 opium.	 At	 a	time	 when	no	 jobs	were	available,	 poverty
was	  rampant	  and	  promised	  foreign	   investment	  in	   agriculture	   had	  not
materialized,	many	farmers	had	no	choice	 but	to	plant	poppies	and	seek	Taliban
protection.
       Britain	  had	been	appointed	 as	the	lead	 nation	 by	the	 Western	alliance	 to
deal	with	counternarcotics,	but	there	was	no	consensus	amongst	the	international
community	 as	to	 the	best	strategy	to	 adopt.	There	 were	endless	debates	about
whether	foreign	 troops	 should	destroy	 the	crops	in	 the	 fields	or	 wait	 and	then
intercept	 convoys	 of	  opium	  on	 the	  roads	 in	 order	  to	 catch	 the	  big	 drug

276
traffickers.	 The	 problem	 was	that	 no	country,	 especially	 the	 USA,	 wanted	its
military	 forces	 to	 be	 involved	 in	 counternarcotics	 -regardless	of	 the	 fact	 that
foreign	 military	 forces	 were	the	 only	 effective	 force	on	 the	ground.	 The	Bush
administration	  refused	 to	  acknowledge	  that	  drugs	  were	 helping	  fuel	   the
insurgency,	 even	 though	 it	 was	 soon	 clear	 to	 everyone,	 including	  the	 UN,
Western	diplomats,	and	Western	aid	 workers,	that	the	income	 from	drugs	was	a
major	source	of	funding	for	 the	Taliban	and	Al	Qaeda.
       Ultimately	    the	  US	  and	  other	   militaries	   refused	  to	  adopt	  a	  clear
counternarcotics	strategy	until	2008.	By	 then	the	insurgents	had	vastly	expanded
their	 profits,	 not	 just	 taxing	  farmers	 but	 refining	 raw	 opium,	  smuggling	 the
product	across	borders	and	linking	 up	with	 mafa	 groups	in	Turkey,	 Europe	and
Central	 Asia.	 According	  to	 the	 United	 Nations	  Office	  of	 Drugs	 and	 Crime
annual	report,	 opium	 production	  rose	to	 6,100	 metric	 tonnes	in	 2006	 and	 to
8,200	 metric	 tonnes	 the	 following	   year,	 contributing	  some	 50	 per	  cent	 of
Afghanistan's	gross	domestic	product	(estimated	at	US$6.7	billion	in	 2006).
       Drug	  money	 was	 everywhere	–	 fuelling	  the	 insurgency,	 subverting	 and
corrupting	 the	  government,	 the	 police	  and	 the	 judicial	   system.	 And	  since
President	Karzai	made	 no	attempt	to	 stop	the	 wholesale	involvement	 of	 senior
politicians	 and	warlords	 in	 the	 drug	 trade,	drugs	 undermined	formal	  work	 by
development	agencies,	for	the	opium	 trade	provided	the	better	jobs,	 income	and
security	that	the	state	was	unable	 to	give.	Drugs	 also	led	to	 increased	addiction
and	despair	among	the	people.
       The	  first	  presidential	 election	  was	 held	 successfully	 in	  October	 2004.
Karzai	 won,	gaining	 55.4	 per	cent	 of	 the	vote	 while	 his	 nearest	rival,	 Younis
Qanuni	of	 the	NA,	 won	 just	16.3	per	 cent.	There	was	a	large	 turnout:	some	73
per	cent	of	 the	 voting	 population	 took	 part,	 indicating	 that	people	 wanted	the
political	 system	 to	 work.	 People	hoped	 that	an	 empowered	Karzai	 would	  act
more	decisively	 and	provide	better	governance,	but	 in	the	end	little	 changed.	In
the	following	  year's	parliamentary	 elections	 the	turnout	 was	only	 53	 per	 cent,
indicating	the	public	 disillusionment	 with	 the	promise	of	 the	democratic	process
and	the	lack	of	 economic	progress.	The	Taliban	 were	still	 not	 strong	enough	to
derail	either	 of	 the	elections,	 although	 they	threatened	voters	 in	 an	attempt	 to
keep	them	from	voting.	 But	the	elections	demonstrated	that	although	the	Taliban
posed	a	 threat	in	  some	southern	 provinces,	 they	 were	 far	 from	 being	 either
popular	or	widespread.
       By	 late	 2004,	US	 and	NATO	  intelligence	 officers	 had	concluded	 that	the
ISI	 was	 running	  a	 full	  training	 programme	  for	 the	 Afghan	  Taliban	 out	  of

277
Baluchistan	 province,	 allowing	  them	 to	 raise	 funds	 in	 the	 Persian	Gulf	  and
Pakistan	and	 letting	 them	 import	 arms	 and	ammunition,	  mainly	 from	  Dubai.
Mullah	 Omar	 and	 the	senior	 Taliban	 leaders	 operated	out	 of	 villages	 in	 and
around	Quetta	 and	 met	 so	 frequently	 and	 freely	 that	 the	 Taliban	 leadership
council	came	to	be	known	as	the	Quetta	Shura.	US	and	Afghan	soldiers	reported
to	their	 superiors	that	the	 Pakistan	army	would	 give	 covering	 fire	 to	groups	 of
Taliban	on	 the	Afghan-Pakistani	 border	that	were	 either	infltrating	  Afghanistan
or	returning	to	Pakistan	after	a	foray.
       Yet	 for	 several	years	the	 Americans	refused	to	 deploy	 sufficient	 troops	in
the	critical	  southern	 provinces.	 Nor	 did	  they	 acknowledge	 the	 double	 game
Musharraf	 was	playing	 and	 never	called	 his	bluff	  until	 it	 was	 too	 late.	When
NATO	 troops	finally	 deployed	in	the	south	in	 2005,	the	USA	was	unable	to	give
them	sufficient	 intelligence	 about	Quetta	 and	southern	Afghanistan	 because,	as
frustrated	US	military	 personnel	told	me,	for	 several	years	the	USA	had	made	no
sustained	satellite	surveillance	of	 the	south.	The	Taliban	were	 thus	free	to	come
and	go	from	Baluchistan,	with	 nobody	to	stop	or	watch	them.
       The	   2005	   summer	  military	    campaign	  by	   the	  Taliban	   effectively
demonstrated	their	new	weapons,	tactics	and	 prowess.	Having	being	 tutored	by
Al	  Qaeda	fighters	  from	  Iraq,	 the	 Taliban	  had	 dramatically	  improved	  their
ambush	tactics,	their	use	of	 improvised	 explosive	devices	 (IEDs)	and	 mines	on
the	roads	and	their	tactical	 use	of	suicide	 bombers	to	carry	 out	attacks	in	 urban
areas	and	against	troop	convoys.	Karzai	 repeatedly	warned	President	Bush	 that
the	Taliban	constituted	 a	growing	 threat	and	an	even	greater	regional	 challenge
than	 Al	   Qaeda,	  because	 the	 Taliban	   insurgency	  directly	   threatened	 his
government.	But	the	White	House	refused	to	accept	his	arguments,	ignoring	both
the	Taliban	 threat	and	 the	need	to	 rebuild	 Afghanistan	 The	USA	 continued	 to
aim	all	its	military	 efforts	 at	trying	to	capture	Al	 Qaeda	members.
       Realizing	 that	 the	intensity	 of	 the	 insurgency	could	 grow,	 Karzai	 tried	 to
initiate	talks	 with	 the	Taliban	and	their	 allies.	In	 2005	he	appointed	a	Peace	and
Reconciliation	 Commission	 that	 was	charged	 with	 trying	 to	 persuade	Taliban
commanders	and	fighters	 to	 return	home	 by	 offering	 them	 amnesty	and	some
political	 incentives.	 But	the	 programme	was	opposed	by	 the	NA	 leaders	in	 the
cabinet	and	parliament,	 and	received	no	 support	from	 the	Bush	 administration,
which	considered	it	a	policy	 of	appeasement.
       In	 the	meantime,	as	the	USA	 became	bogged	down	in	Iraq	and	the	Taliban
insurgency	 gained	 power	 in	  Afghanistan,	 Washington	  had	 finally	  began	 to
encourage	the	expansion	 of	 the	 ISAF	  –	the	 peace-keeping	force	 in	  Kabul	 –

278
beyond	the	capital.	 Intensive	talks	 had	begun	between	the	 Bush	administration
and	NATO	   as	to	  how	 countries	 could	  deploy	 extra	 troops.	 The	 Provincial
Reconstruction	 Teams	(PRTs)	 that	 the	 Americans	 had	 established	 in	 certain
critical	provinces	 had	been	deemed	a	success,	and	the	demand	grew	for	different
NATO	 countries	 to	set	 up	PRTs	in	 each	of	 Afghanistan's	 34	 provinces.	PRTs
were	groups	of	 up	to	 a	hundred	 soldiers,	assisted	by	trainers	 and	development
workers,	who	were	 expected	to	provide	backup	 for	development	and	training	 to
police	 and	 officials	  in	 the	 provinces.	 Many	  of	 the	 European	 countries	 who
supported	sending	troops	to	Afghanistan	 under	NATO	 auspices	agreed	to	do	so
only	in	order	to	avoid	 sending	troops	to	Iraq	without	offending	 Washington.
       NATO	  took	 command	of	 the	ISAF	 in	 Kabul,	 and	the	first	 German	 troops
arrived	in	northern	Afghanistan	 in	early	2004.	In	 a	four-phase	plan	NATO	 began
to	deploy	troops	 in	PRTs	to	 every	province,	 starting	with	 the	north	in	 2004	and
ending	with	 the	south	 in	2006;	 there	British,	 Dutch	 and	Canadian	troops	 faced
the	full	  brunt	 of	 the	 Taliban	 insurgency.	 Many	  countries,	 however,	 attached
caveats	to	their	 troop	 deployment,	 forbidding	  their	 troops	to	 take	 part	in	 any
fighting.	 Consequently,	 there	were	now	 two	 separate	command	structures:	 the
NATO-ISAF	  command,	 which	  included	 US	 troops	  and	was	 responsible	 for
peace-keeping	in	the	 country,	 and	the	 US-led	coalition,	  still	 called	 ‘Operation
Enduring	Freedom’,	 which	 hunted	down	 the	Taliban	 and	Al	 Qaeda.	Eventually
both	commands	would	be	led	by	US	generals.
       In	 an	effort	to	stem	the	spread	of	these	foreign	troops,	the	Taliban	organized
a	broad	offensive	 for	the	summer	 of	2006	 aimed	at	seizing	the	 southern	capital
of	 Kandahar	  and	 thus	 shaking	  NATO's	  resolve.	 In	  mid-May	   the	 Taliban
launched	 coordinated	 attacks	 in	  four	  provinces	 involving	   several	 thousand
fighters.	British	  forces	set	up	outposts	 in	Helmand	 –	the	 first	 foreign	 troops	to
arrive	 in	 the	 province	  since	 2001	 –	 and	 were	 immediately	 surrounded	 and
attacked	repeatedly	 by	  the	 Taliban.	  The	 fully	  equipped	 Taliban	  were	 now
confident	enough	to	operate	in	battalion-size	 units	of	 up	to	400	men	each	which
could	deploy	hundreds	of	Toyota	 Land	Cruisers	and	motorbikes	to	increase	their
mobility.
       In	 the	south	the	Taliban	appointed	governors	and	judges	in	 a	bid	to	set	up	a
parallel	administration	 and	justice	system	to	woo	 the	local	population.	 It	 was	an
audacious	but	 successful	 move	 that	 soon	 spread	 to	 eastern	Afghanistan.	  In
addition,	the	Taliban	 targeted	the	Afghan	administration	 –	officials,	 bureaucrats,
teachers	and	most	of	 all	 the	police	 force,	 which	 was	 already	demoralized	 and
disorganized.	More	 and	 more	 civilians	 were	 being	 killed	  either	 because	they

279
were	deliberately	  targeted	by	 Taliban	 suicide	 bombers	 or	 because	they	were
caught	in	the	 crossfre.	In	 2006,	according	 to	news	reports	 and	UN	 end-of-year
assessments,	the	Taliban	burned	down	 187	schools	 and	killed	 85	 teachers	and
more	than	600	policemen.
       Suicide	 bombers	became	a	regular	feature	of	the	Taliban	 arsenal.	Although
the	Taliban	had	mounted	only	 six	 suicide	attacks	in	2004,	 the	number	had	risen
in	2006	 to	 a	staggering	141	 attacks	that	 left	 1,166	 casualties.	Infantry	 attacks
were	increasingly	 planned	around	 sending	suicide	 bombers	in	 first	 to	 create	a
breach	in	the	defences	of	the	target.	Meanwhile	the	excessive	use	of	airpower	by
US	forces,	 owing	 to	the	 shortage	of	troops	 and	helicopters	 caused	by	the	 Iraq
war,	antagonized	 the	local	 population,	 since	bombs	 frequently	 killed	  as	many
civilians	 as	they	did	Taliban	 fighters	and	the	Taliban	 had	become	adept	at	using
civilians	 as	 shields	 and	hostages	to	 prevent	 being	 bombed.	 NATO	  had	 also
greatly	 expanded	its	 use	of	 airpower,	 largely	  because	there	were	 insufficient
troops	on	the	ground	and	because	NATO	countries	wanted	to	avoid	casualties.	In
the	last	six	months	 of	2006	there	were	 2,100	air	strikes	 by	US	forces	 compared
to	just	88	air	strikes	over	Iraq	in	 the	same	period.
       In	 September	2006	the	Taliban	 began	to	infltrate	 Kandahur	 from	a	 base	in
the	district	 of	Panjwai	 near	the	outskirts	 of	 the	city.	 The	sparse	Western	forces
patrolling	 outside	 Kandahar	city	  discovered	the	 well-established	 base	and	the
thousands	of	 fighters	 housed	 there	only	  when	the	 Taliban	 launched	 a	 major
offensive	against	 the	city.	 The	 attack	on	 Kandahar,	for	 which	 the	Taliban	 had
prepared	in	Pakistan,	organizing	 large	 amounts	of	arms,	 ammunition	 and	other
logistical	 aid,	was	 a	turning	 point	 in	 Western	thinking	 about	 Pakistan.	For	 the
first	 time	US	 and	NATO	  commanders	publicly	 accused	Pakistan	of	 aiding	 the
Taliban.
       The	 Taliban	 were	also	 adept	at	exploiting	 the	 deep	differences	within	  the
NATO	 alliance	and	the	 fact	that	many	 countries	had	sent	forces	to	 Afghanistan
that	were	 not	 empowered	to	 fight.	 There	 were	now	 troops	 from	 37	 countries
taking	part	in	 peace-keeping	operations,	but	the	need	was	increasingly	 for	more
fighting	 troops.	 In	 2006,	NATO-led	  forces	 numbered	45,000	 men,	but	 only	 a
third	were	available	for	 fighting.
       ‘In	   committing	  the	 alliance	  to	 sustained	 ground	 combat	 operations	 in
Afghanistan	NATO	 has	bet	its	future’,	 said	US	 General	James	Jones,	the	former
head	of	 NATO	  and	later	 the	 National	 Security	 Adviser	  for	 President	Barack
Obama.	‘If	   NATO	  were	 to	 fail,	  alliance	 cohesion	 will	  be	 at	 grave	 risk.	 A
moribund	or	 unravelled	NATO	  would	 have	a	profoundly	 negative	geo-strategic

280
impact’,	 he	 added.4	In	April	  2007,	 Lieutenant	 General	 Karl	 Eikenberry,	 who
commanded	the	 ISAF	  forces,	 became	 the	 first	  US	 general	 to	 publicly	   tell
Congress	and	 NATO	  that	they	 could	  not	 win	 in	 Afghanistan	  without	  doing
something	about	the	sanctuaries	the	Taliban	maintained	in	Pakistan.5
       NATO	  countries	spent	 much	of	 2007	bickering	 amongst	 themselves	as	to
where	 the	  war	 in	  Afghanistan	   was	 heading	 rather	  than	  beefng	 up	  their
contingents,	 providing	  more	 helicopters,	  removing	  the	 restrictions	  on	 their
troops	and	coming	up	with	a	more	comprehensive	policy	 towards	Pakistan.	Even
though	 the	 USA	 was	 now	  pouring	 in	  more	 money	 to	 establish	 an	 Afghan
National	Army	 of	 some	134,000	men	and	a	trained	and	equipped	police	force	of
80,000	men,	the	real	US	focus	remained	on	Iraq.
       The	 Taliban	 made	greater	use	of	 IEDs	 and	suicide	bombers.	 Some	of	 the
deadliest	suicide	attacks	planned	by	the	Jalaluddin	 Haqqani	group	 took	place	in
Kabul,	such	as	the	one	in	which	 31	Afghan	army	 recruits	were	killed	 in	an	army
bus	by	 a	suicide	 bomber	 in	 September	2007.	 A	 few	 months	 later	 a	wave	 of
suicide	bombers	attacked	the	heavily	guarded	Serena	Hotel	in	 Kabul,	 killing	 six
people.	 The	 police	 continued	  to	 be	 a	 major	  target	 for	  the	 Taliban	  in	 the
countryside	–	some	900	policemen	were	killed	in	 2007.
       Al	 Qaeda	also	taught	the	Taliban	how	 to	set	up	sophisticated	media	outlets,
which	produced	tens	of	 thousands	of	DVDs	 and	inspirational	 tapes	that	sold	for
a	few	pennies	in	the	bazaars	of	Pakistan	and	Afghanistan.	The	Taliban	now	 used
web	sites,	 FM	 radio	 stations	and	 email,	 and	their	 spokesmen	(often	 based	in
Quetta)	 gave	  interviews	  to	  journalists	  based	 in	  Pakistan.	 Their	  favourite
propaganda	tool	became	an	FM	radio	station	that	could	be	loaded	on	a	donkey	or
the	back	  of	 a	 pickup	 and	 carried	 around	 an	 area	 to	 avoid	 detection	  while
broadcasting	Taliban	messages.	This	was	all	 in	sharp	contrast	to	 the	Taliban	 of
the	 1990s,	who	  abhorred	 the	 media,	 banning	 most	 media	 outlets	 including
television	 out	 of	 a	refusal	 to	 see	the	 usefulness	of	 propaganda.	Much	 of	 the
Taliban's	newfound	 acumen	came	from	 the	 Al	 Qaeda	media	outlet	 ‘al-Sahab’,
which	issued	89	messages	of	various	kinds	 in	2007	 –	including	 tapes	of	Osama
Bin	Laden	and	Aiman	al-Zawahiri.
       Despite	 the	 Taliban's	 increased	 sophistication,	 for	  the	first	  time	 NATO
started	having	some	luck	 in	their	 efforts	 to	kill	 top	 Taliban	commanders.	There
was	also	 a	limited	  improvement	 in	 intelligence	 cooperation	 between	Pakistan
and	NATO	  and	US	 forces.	 Mullah	 Akthar	  Usmani,	the	 former	 Taliban	 corps
commander	and	member	of	the	Quetta	Shura,	was	killed	in	 a	British	 air	strike	in
Helmand	in	 December	 2006.	In	 March	 2007	 Mullah	  Obaidullah	 Akhund	 was

281
arrested	in	Quetta	by	 the	ISI	 after	considerable	US	and	British	  pressure,	but	he
was	later	freed	in	 a	hostage	exchange	with	Pakistani	Taliban	 who	 were	holding
Pakistani	soldiers.	Mullah	 Dadullah,	 the	much	reviled	 and	brutal	 commander	in
southern	Afghanistan	 who	 had	kicked	 off	 the	 insurgency	in	 2003	 by	killing	  a
Red	Cross	official,	 was	finally	  killed	 in	 May	2007	 in	a	fire	 fight	 in	 Garmser	in
Helmand	after	being	 tracked	down	by	 British	 commandos.	His	brother	 replaced
him	as	commander	but	was	later	arrested	in	Pakistan.
       These	losses	led	 to	the	elevation	 of	 Mullah	 Abdul	 Ghani	 Baradar,	a	close
companion	of	 Mullah	  Omar's	 from	 the	 earliest	days	 of	 the	 Taliban.	 He	 now
presided	over	the	Taliban's	military	 committee	in	Quetta,	appointed	and	demoted
commanders	and	presided	over	the	all-important	war	chest,	from	 which	he	doled
out	 funds	  to	  his	 field	   commanders.6	Baradar	  became	 the	 de	  facto	  field
commander	of	the	Taliban	as	Mullah	Omar	remained	largely	 in	hiding.
       With	  all	the	problems	 within	 NATO	 and	the	lack	 of	US	 focus,	the	Taliban
were	 seeking	  to	  outlast	 Western	  forces,	  and	 to	  some	 extent	  they	  were
succeeding.	As	long	 as	 the	Karzai	 government	 failed	 to	 govern	effectively	  or
provide	services	and	jobs	to	the	people,	as	long	as	it	allowed	corruption	and	drug
trafficking	  to	 take	 place	 under	 its	 very	 nose,	 the	 Taliban	 were	 winning	  by
default.	The	failure	 of	 the	government	 to	provide	 quick	 and	effective	 justice	to
the	people	only	further	helped	the	Taliban	cause.
       Equally	 important	 to	the	Taliban's	 growing	 success	in	Afghanistan	was	the
fact	that	 despite	all	 the	pressure	on	 Islamabad	and	 Pakistan's	growing	 travails
with	the	 home-grown	Taliban	 movement,	the	Pakistan	army	refused	to	 abandon
the	Afghan	 Taliban	  leadership	in	 Quetta.	 Nor	 did	 it	 put	 any	 pressure	on	 the
forces	of	Gulbuddin	 Hikmetyar	 and	Jalaluddin	Haqqani,	 who	were	still	 based	in
FATA	 and	whom	Pakistani	officials	 described	as	strategic	allies	of	Pakistan.
       In	 the	summer	of	2008	the	Taliban	expanded	into	the	provinces	surrounding
Kabul,	from	 which	 they	had	been	ejected	in	2001.	 This	compelled	 US	forces	to
take	up	positions	 in	 these	provinces,	particularly	 to	 safeguard	major	 roads	that
ran	out	of	Kabul	 to	 the	provinces.	Heavy	fighting	  ensued	as	the	Taliban	tried	to
protect	their	  gains,	though	 the	 Americans	 were	 able	 to	 open	 the	 roads,	and
security	improved	 in	these	provinces.	The	 following	  year	the	Taliban	 expanded
into	the	northern	and	western	provinces,	particularly	 Kunduz,	 where	they	fought
German	troops,	and	 Herat,	where	Italian	  and	Spanish	troops	were	 based.	Here
they	were	more	 successful	because	of	the	severe	restrictions	 that	the	European
troops	operated	under	as	their	governments	forbade	them	to	go	 on	the	offensive
against	the	Taliban.

282
       Iraq	 consumed	a	great	deal	of	attention	 during	 the	US	presidential	election
campaign	in	 2008,	but	 the	Democratic	 candidate,	Barack	 Obama,	promised	 to
make	Afghanistan	 his	principal	 focus,	 criticizing	 President	Bush	 for	 neglecting
the	root	causes	of	international	terrorism	that	lay	in	Pakistan	and	Afghanistan.	At
the	same	time,	  however,	the	 election	 campaign	 led	 to	 a	severe	 break	in	 US
policy	 towards	Afghanistan	 that	lasted	throughout	 the	second	half	 of	 2008	and
until	Obama	was	sworn	in	as	president	in	January	2009.	Afghanistan	desperately
needed	more	 troops,	 more	 money	  and	 a	 new	 strategy	 so	 that	 the	 its	 own
presidential	elections,	due	to	 be	held	in	 August	2009,	 could	be	carried	 out	with
some	security.	But	 the	 Bush	administration	 failed	 to	 take	any	 of	the	 decisions
that	were	 so	 desperately	needed,	leaving	 everything	  to	 the	incoming	  Obama
team.
       The	 Taliban	 took	advantage	of	 the	USA's	 inertia	by	 launching	 spectacular
suicide	attacks	in	the	cities	and	large-unit	guerrilla	 assaults	in	the	countryside,	as
well	 as	 stepping	 up	 the	 use	of	  IEDs.	 The	 Taliban	 attempted	 to	 assassinate
President	Karzai	 in	 April	  2008	while	  he	was	 taking	 the	salute	at	 a	parade	 in
Kabul,	 and	on	13	 June	there	was	a	mass	attack	 on	Kandahar	 prison	that	 freed
1,100	inmates,	including	 400	Taliban	members.	The	following	  month	the	Indian
embassy	in	  Kabul	 was	 bombed,	 and	 nine	 US	  soldiers	 were	 killed	  and	 15
wounded	 in	 a	 single	 day's	 fighting	  in	 Kunar	  province	 –	 the	 highest	 single
battlefield	loss	for	the	US	army	 since	the	war	began.
       For	 the	first	 time	 more	Western	 troops	were	dying	 in	 Afghanistan	 than	in
Iraq.	 There	 was	 a	 worsening	 of	 the	 humanitarian	  crisis	 in	  drought-plagued
regions,	 and	 reconstruction	 came	 to	  a	 virtual	  halt	 as	 aid	  agencies	limited
themselves	to	Kabul	after	the	deaths	of	26	aid	workers	in	2008.
       Immediately	   on	 assuming	 office,	  the	 Obama	 administration	  conducted
several	rapid	reviews	 of	US	 policy	 towards	Afghanistan	 and	Pakistan	and	after
consulting	 with	  all	 branches	of	  the	 US	 government,	 especially	 the	 military,
unveiled	its	 strategy	 on	27	 March	 2009.	The	 new	 policy	 promised	 that	major
attention	would	 be	paid	to	what	was	now	 termed	Af-Pak	 and	the	region.	Obama
appointed	veteran	diplomat	Richard	Holbrooke	 as	the	Special	Envoy	for	 Af-Pak,
while	General	David	 Petraeus,	who	had	won	accolades	for	his	counterinsurgency
strategy	in	Iraq,	took	 over	US	 Central	Command	headquarters.	A	new	 US	army
doctrine	acknowledged	that	 stabilizing	 war-torn	 countries	was	just	 as	important
as	defeating	the	enemy	militarily.
       The	 USA	poured	21,000	marines	into	 southern	Afghanistan	in	the	spring	 of
2009	including	 4,000	military	 trainers	 charged	with	speeding	up	the	build	 up	of

283
the	Afghan	  army	 and	police.	 NATO	  promised	 at	 least	9,000	 extra	 troops	 to
provide	security	for	 the	August	presidential	election.	 For	all	the	lead	being	taken
by	 foreign	 actors	 –	 the	 USA,	  NATO,	  the	 European	 Union	 and	 the	 United
Nations	–	most	of	 2009	was	taken	up	preparing	for	 the	election	and	ensuring	its
security.	Everything	 else	had	to	be	put	on	hold.	 In	private	 US	officials	 regretted
the	way	 the	elections	 had	distracted	 attention	 from	 the	implementation	  of	 the
new	Obama	policy.	 Obama,	meanwhile,	 was	unable	 to	point	 to	any	 immediate
success	for	his	policy	or	prove	that	it	was	the	right	one	for	 Afghanistan.
       Another	   issue	 complicating	  matters	  for	  Obama	 was	  the	 fraught	  US
relationship	with	 President	Hamid	Karzai,	 who	in	 the	spring	was	convinced	 that
Obama	and	Holbrooke	  wanted	to	 replace	him	 and	 hold	 the	elections	 under	 a
caretaker	president.	Although	 this	was	never	 the	case,	Karzai's	paranoia,	which
was	 constantly	 being	 fuelled	  by	 his	 aides	 and	 brothers,	 who	  drummed	 up
amazing	conspiracy	 theories	 about	 US	 and	British	  bad	 faith,	 kept	 him	 from
trusting	the	 Westerners,	as	Afghan	 officials	  and	other	 sources	close	to	 Karzai
told	me.
       The	 Taliban	 did	 not	shrink	 from	 the	 challenge	of	 the	 elections.	They	 too
had	prepared	during	the	winter	and	poured	both	men	and	materials	into	the	south
to	confront	the	Marines.	 According	 to	military	 expert	 Anthony	Cordesman,	who
was	advising	  General	 Stanley	 McChrystal,	  on	 the	 eve	 of	  the	 elections	 the
Taliban	 control	 of	 just	 30	 out	 of	 364	districts	  in	 2003	had	 expanded	to	 164
districts.	 Taliban	 attacks	increased	by	 60	per	 cent	between	 October	2008	 and
April	 2009	alone.	 Forty-four	 American	 soldiers	died	 in	 July	and	47	 in	 August,
making	those	the	deadliest	two	months	in	the	war	for	the	US	army.	 British	 losses
were	also	the	highest	they	had	ever	been.7
       The	 Taliban	were	 now	deploying	 mass	suicide	attacks,	with	 up	 to	a	dozen
suicide	bombers	being	used	to	attack	a	target	while	other	soldiers	followed	 them
to	storm	the	location.	The	Americans	insisted	that	these	were	desperate	measures
and	 demonstrated	the	 growing	  weakness	 of	  the	 Taliban,	 but	  they	 terrified
Western	troops	 as	well	 as	local	 police	 and	administrations.	 On	 the	eve	of	 the
elections	it	was	clear	that	the	whole	country	had	become	more	unsafe.
       Forty-one	 politicians	  put	their	 names	down	 to	run	 for	 the	presidency,	 but
the	front	runner	was	clearly	President	Karzai	himself,	 even	though	his	popularity
was	at	its	lowest	 ebb	and	the	alliances	 he	was	striking	 with	 former	 warlords	 to
help	 him	  win	  the	  elections	 had	 disheartened	 many	  Afghans.	  His	  nearest
challengers	were	Dr	 Abdullah	 Abdullah,	 the	 former	 Tajik	 foreign	 minister	 and
close	aide	to	 Ahmad	 Shah	 Masud,	and	 Dr	 Ashraf	 Ghani,	 the	former	 Pashtun

284
finance	minister.
       The	  Taliban	   promised	  to	  intensify	  their	  attacks	  against	 presidential
candidates,	 their	  campaign	 managers,	 and	  the	 provincial	   councils,	  whose
elections	were	taking	 place	on	the	same	day.	The	Taliban	 opened	new	fronts	 in
the	north	and	west,	where	they	had	had	little	presence	before.	Kunduz	became	an
intense	battleground:	 57	 rockets	 landed	 in	 the	 city	 on	 election	 day,	 and	 the
German	troops	were	under	constant	ambush.	The	US	military	 did	not	 try	to	hide
the	truth:	  ‘It's	 serious	 and	 it	 is	 deteriorating….	  The	 Taliban	 insurgency	 has
gotten	 better,	  more	 sophisticated	  in	 their	  tactics’,	  Admiral	   Mike	   Mullen,
Chairman	of	 the	 US	Joint	 Chiefs	 of	 Staff,	 announced	on	CNN's	 ‘State	 of	 the
Nation’	on	23	August.
       There	were	also	high-profile	  Taliban	attacks	in	other	cities,	including	 Kabul
and	Kandahar,	well-laid	  ambushes	and	attacks	 against	security	 forces	and	 the
extensive	use	of	IEDs.	Thousands	of	US,	British	 and	Afghan	 forces	launched	an
offensive	 in	 Helmand	 province	  in	 southern	 Afghanistan	 a	 month	 before	 the
elections	in	 order	 to	 regain	 territory,	  block	 supply	 routes	 from	 Pakistan	 and
release	villagers	from	 the	clutches	of	the	Taliban	 so	that	they	 could	vote.	When
the	elections	took	place	voter	turnout	 was	estimated	at	between	1	and	5	per	cent
in	most	 parts	of	 Helmand	 and	Kandahar	-until	  major	ballot	 stuffng	 for	 Karzai
began	in	the	late	hours	of	20	August.	In	Babaji,	a	town	 in	Helmand	that	had	been
reclaimed	by	British	 forces	with	 the	loss	of	 four	soldiers,	only	 150	people	voted
of	the	80,000	who	could	 have.	The	British	suffered	37	 dead	and	150	wounded	in
the	 six-week	  Helmand	  campaign	  to	 secure	  the	 vote.	  In	  another	 village,
Zangabad,	 in	 Panjwai	  district	  in	  Kandahar	  province	 –	  which	  was	 totally
controlled	by	the	Taliban	 –	not	a	single	vote	was	cast,	but	2,000	votes	for	Karzai
were	sent	up	to	 Kabul	 to	 be	counted.	The	 fraud	and	ballot	 stuffng	 by	 Karzai's
supporters	was	on	an	epic	scale.
       The	Taliban	 had	threatened	to	derail	the	elections	and	in	one	sense	they	did:
the	terrified	population	 did	not	turn	 out	to	vote.	Turnout	 was	half	that	of	 the	first
presidential	elections	in	 2004,	when	it	 was	73	per	cent.	There	were	400	Taliban
attacks	on	  election	 day	 in	  which	  26	 people	 were	 killed	  and	 dozens	 more
wounded	–	one	of	the	worst	days	of	violence	in	the	country's	history.
       The	 most	insensitive	 move	 in	the	 hours	after	 the	polls	 closed	came	when
the	USA,	NATO,	  the	European	Union	 and	the	UN	 all	congratulated	themselves
and	the	citizens	 of	 Afghanistan	 on	the	‘successful	 election’.	 Their	 words	 were
aimed	at	 the	Taliban,	 who	 had	 failed	 to	 stop	the	 elections,	 but	they	 sounded
hollow	and	deceitful	 to	Afghans,	 who	were	more	interested	in	the	validity	  of	the

285
elections.	Meanwhile,	the	Election	 Commission	 received	over	2,500	complaints,
of	 which	 570	 were	 considered	 serious	enough	 to	 affect	 the	 outcome	 of	 the
elections.
       The	 vote	 rigging	  should	 never	have	 happened.	There	 were	 hundreds	of
foreign	observers	–	 personnel	stationed	at	the	embassies	and	representatives	of
the	UN	 –	as	well	 as	a	European	Union	 delegation	and	other	monitoring	  groups
whose	specific	job	was	to	make	sure	that	this	would	 be	a	valid	election.	Afghans
and	other	experts	had	warned	 the	embassies	about	possible	vote	rigging	 weeks
earlier,	but	the	foreign	monitors	 refused	to	go	into	the	countryside	because	of	the
security	risks.	Ultimately	  the	entire	Western	community	 was	caught	napping	 by
the	vote	 rigging.	 The	 biggest	mistake	 was	probably	 the	 UN's	 not	running	 the
elections,	as	it	had	done	in	 2004,	but	instead	handing	 them	over	to	 the	Afghan-
run	Independent	Election	 Commission,	 which	 was	beholden	 to	Karzai	 because
he	had	appointed	its	members.
       For	 weeks	 before	 the	final	  results	came	 out	the	 country	 was	 filled	  with
enormous	uncertainty.	 It	 was	 clear	 that	 even	if	  Karzai	 won	 the	 election,	 the
opposition	and	much	 of	the	public	 might	 not	accept	him	 as	the	legitimate	 ruler.
On	the	other	 hand,	if	 Karzai	 failed	 to	 secure	51	per	 cent	of	 the	vote,	 a	runoff
between	Karzai	and	 Abdullah	 would	 be	held	 in	October.	 The	situation	 left	 the
country	 paralyzed	for	  two	 months,	 and	there	 were	 fears	 that	ethnic	 tensions
would	increase.	Final	results	are	still	awaited.	In	the	completed	first	 count	Karzai
won	 55.6	per	 cent	 of	 the	 vote	and	 Abdullah	  27.8	per	 cent,	 but	 the	Election
Complaints	Commission	identified	 more	 than	2,500	polling	 stations	where	fraud
took	place	 and	ordered	 a	recount	 of	 some	1	 million	  votes,	which	  was	taking
place	as	this	book	 went	to	 press.	It	 is	clear	that	 Karzai	 has	won,	but	 he	has	to
restore	his	credibility	 in	the	eyes	of	the	international	 community	 and	the	Afghan
people.	Whatever	  happens,	the	 Taliban	  has	gained	 immeasurably	  from	 this
botched	process.
       In	  his	 election	  campaign	 Karzai	 had	 promised	  that	 he	 would	 step	 up
negotiations	with	 the	 Taliban	even	 though	they	 had	rejected	any	 proposals	for
talks	–	both	Karzai	and	the	international	 community	 had	become	more	amenable
to	 negotiating	 with	  the	 Taliban.	 The	 USA	 had	 encouraged	 Saudi	Arabia	  to
establish	an	indirect	 link	 with	 them,	and	 several	meetings	were	held	 in	Riyadh
between	representatives	of	Karzai	and	former	Taliban	commanders.	Increasingly
there	were	 attempts	to	 woo	 those	 whom	 the	international	  community	 termed
moderate	Taliban	members.	 These	included	the	 commanders	and	soldiers	 who
were	not	fighting	 for	 ideological	 reasons	but	out	of	 anger,	frustration,	 hatred	of

286
the	Americans,	the	pay	or	fear	of	the	Taliban.
       In	 the	1990s	the	Afghan	Taliban	were	essentially	a	peasant	army	rather	than
an	international	 terrorist	  organization.	 This	 is	 what	 they	 still	 are,	 though	 the
upper	echelons	are	composed	of	hard-core	jihadists	 who	 desire	no	compromise
with	the	 Americans	or	 the	Kabul	 regime.	Some,	like	 Mullah	 Omar,	are	wedded
to	the	Al	 Qaeda	philosophy	 of	global	 jihad.	 Nevertheless,	in	deciding	 to	talk	 to
the	Taliban,	Karzai	 and	the	West	were	belatedly	acknowledging	 that	the	Taliban
were	not	a	monolithic	 organization	 but	one	in	 which	 there	were	several	interest
groups,	some	of	which	 could	be	won	 over.	As	 long	as	the	Taliban	 believed	that
they	were	winning,	 however	 -and	the	botched	 elections	only	 tended	to	confirm
that	–	they	were	unlikely	 to	 accept	the	idea	of	a	negotiated	settlement	to	end	the
war	or	to	put	their	faith	 in	the	Afghan	constitution	 and	parliament.
       The	  real	 impact	  of	  the	 Taliban	  ideology	  was	 being	 felt	  in	  Pakistan.
Compared	to	 the	Afghan	  Taliban,	 the	Pakistani	 Taliban	 that	 arose	across	the
border	proved	to	 be	far	 more	ideological,	 ruthless	and	committed	 to	 Al	 Qaeda.
For	years	Pakistan	has	been	a	ripe	target	for	Islamic	militants	as	it	has	frequently
been	on	the	 brink	 of	 political	  and	social	 chaos.	For	 nearly	 a	half	 century	 the
military	 and	 the	civilians	  have	competed	for	 power,	 and	no	 adequate	political
resolution	is	 yet	in	 sight.	There	 may	never	be	 a	mass	revolutionary	 uprising	 in
Pakistan	like	the	one	in	Iran	 in	1979,	but	a	slow,	 insidious	climate	 of	fear,	terror
and	paralysis	incited	 by	 the	Taliban	 and	other	 extremists	is	 spreading	because
the	state	has	been	unable	or	unwilling	to	 stamp	them	out.	Moreover,	the	country
faces	 growing	   social	  unrest	 fuelled	   by	  the	  sharp	 division	   between	  the
extraordinary	wealth	of	 the	elite	and	the	increasing	poverty	of	the	majority	 of	the
population.	 The	  state	is	  no	 longer	 able	  to	 deliver	  social	 services	 such	 as
education,	healthcare	and	 housing	 to	 those	in	 need.	All	  these	problems	 have
helped	the	Taliban	take	hold	in	Pakistan.
       The	  failure	 of	  the	 USA	 to	 destroy	 Al	  Qaeda	 and	 the	 Afghan	 Taliban
leadership	in	 the	2001	 war	allowed	 many	 Taliban	 and	Al	  Qaeda	commanders
and	fighters	 to	escape	into	 Pakistan	and	take	 up	safe	residence	in	 Baluchistan
and	 the	 tribal	  badlands	of	  FATA.	  While	  the	  bulk	 of	  the	 original	  Taliban
leadership	fed	  to	 Baluchistan	 province,	  many	 fighters	 fed	 to	  FATA.	  These
included	  Arabs,	  Central	   Asians,	  Russian	  Muslims,	   Chechens,	  Africans,
Indonesians	and	Uighurs	 from	 western	China.	 More	 recently	 recruits	from	 the
USA	and	Europe	have	also	trained	in	FATA.
       FATA	  is	 made	 up	of	  seven	tribal	 agencies	–	 Khyber,	 Kurram,	  Orakzai,
Mohmand,	Bajaur	 and	North	and	South	Waziristan	 –	with	 a	population	 of	some

287
4.5	million	  Pashtuns,	in	 addition	  to	 the	28	 million	  Pashtuns	who	 live	 in	  the
NWFP	and	the	15	million	 who	live	 across	the	border	in	Afghanistan.	It	was	from
FATA	 that	attacks	against	Madrid,	 London,	Bali	 and	other	places	were	planned.
With	  high	 mountains,	 rugged	  terrain,	 few	  roads	 and	 a	 sparse,	xenophobic
population	  who	  have	 never	  received	 education,	  medical	  care	 or	  modern
development,	FATA	 is	the	ideal	recruiting	ground	for	 Al	 Qaeda.
       FATA	  was	established	by	 the	British	 in	 1901	as	a	 no-man's-land	between
Afghanistan	 and	  British	  India.	  Britain	  exercised	  indirect	  control	  over	 the
agencies	through	the	Governor	General	of	the	NWFP	 and	political	 agents	on	the
ground.	This	 system	–	now	 totally	 outdated	–	 is	what	 Pakistan	has	maintained
ever	since.	 Even	political	  parties	 were	banned	 from	 operating	 in	 FATA,	  and
Pakistan's	laws	and	constitution	did	not	extend	there.	Efforts	to	carry	 out	reforms
in	FATA	  were	blocked	 both	by	 local	tribal	 chiefs	 who	enjoyed	 their	 privileges
and	by	the	army,	 which	used	FATA	  as	a	training	ground	 for	 the	militants	 to	be
sent	to	Kashmir	or	Afghanistan.
       The	Bush	administration	 did	not	question	Musharraf	 about	FATA's	 status	as
long	 as	the	 Pakistan	army	 and	 ISI	 cooperated	 with	 the	 principal	 US	 aim	 of
capturing	 Al	 Qaeda	 leaders.	Washington's	 limited	  and	highly	  selective	 goals
suited	the	 Pakistan	army	 perfectly,	 because	it	 wanted	 to	preserve	 the	Afghan
Taliban	as	a	 fighting	 force	 in	 order	to	 exert	future	 pressure	on	Kabul,	 prevent
India	 from	  playing	 a	 large	  role	 in	 Afghanistan	  and	 influence	 the	 financial
support	that	the	West	gave	to	the	 Musharraf	regime.	 At	the	same	time	 the	army
had	no	 reason	to	 support	 Al	  Qaeda	so	 it	 was	 willing	  to	 cooperate	with	  the
Americans	 in	  their	 pursuit	  of	 those	 terrorists.	 The	  army,	 like	  the	 Taliban,
believed	that	the	 USA	 and	NATO	  would	 soon	leave	Afghanistan	 and	that	 one
day	pro-Pakistan	Afghan	Pashtun	elements	would	return	to	power	in	Kabul.
       Many	 Pashtuns	from	 FATA	 had	fought	 for	 the	Afghan	 Taliban	 during	 the
civil	 war	in	Afghanistan	 in	the	1990s	and	again	during	and	after	the	US	invasion.
They	had	been	able	 foot	soldiers	 for	 both	the	 Taliban	and	 Al	 Qaeda.	Now	 the
Pakistani	Pashtun	 in	 FATA	  became	the	 hosts	of	 the	 Taliban	 and	 Al	  Qaeda,
providing	 safe	houses,	food,	transport	and	other	logistics	 to	their	guests,	who	 in
turn	paid	 the	local	 Pashtuns	lavishly	for	 the	hospitality	  and	help	they	 received.
Living	 alongside	foreign	 radicals	for	 so	many	years,	it	was	only	 natural	that	 the
local	Pashtuns	would	 also	 become	radicalized,	 even	as	they	 became	rich,	 and
that	they	would	ultimately	 develop	their	own	 political	 agenda.
       Soon	former	 fighters	 and	guides	who	once	used	donkeys	could	afford	 feets
of	pickup	trucks	and	hire	hundreds	of	bodyguards,	who	then	developed	into	local

288
militias.	 As	 Al	 Qaeda	and	the	Afghan	 Taliban	 leaders	went	underground,	 their
local	 Pashtun	acolytes	 increasingly	 took	 on	 the	job	 of	  training,	 fund	 raising,
planning	 and	adapting	 the	new	 guerrilla	  war	technology	 that	 was	 being	 used
against	 US	  forces	 in	  Afghanistan.	  The	  local	  Pashtun	 population	  became
indispensable	to	Al	Qaeda	and	the	Afghan	Taliban	as	both	fighters	and	trainers.
       Between	 2001	and	 2004	the	army	 and	the	ISI	 made	no	 effort	 to	 stop	this
activity,	 vigorously	 denying	 that	 it	 was	even	 going	on.	 They	 also	vehemently
denied	that	the	Afghan	Taliban	or	 Al	 Qaeda	were	in	Pakistan	and	berated	Karzai
and	 any	 Western	  diplomat	  who	 dared	  say	 they	 were.	  But	  after	 the	  two
assassination	attempts	against	President	 Musharraf	 in	 December	 2003,	which
were	planned	in	 South	 Waziristan,	 the	army	 slowly	 woke	 up	 to	the	 threat.	Its
half-hearted	response	was	 to	 send	into	  South	 Waziristan	 in	 March	 2004	 the
Frontier	Corps	(FC)	 –	paramilitary	 troops	 made	up	of	poorly	 armed	and	trained
Pashtuns	led	by	army	officers.	The	small	 FC	force,	without	 air	cover,	artillery	 or
good	intelligence,	 faced	 off	 against	some	 2,000	militants,	  who	ambushed	and
badly	mauled	it.	 About	 200	soldiers	were	 killed,	 and	many	more	were	 captured
and	later	executed.	Still	others	deserted	the	FC.
       The	 Wazir	militants	 and	their	leader,	Nek	Mohammed,	aged	27,	emerged	as
heroes.	On	24	April	 2004	the	army	 signed	the	first	 of	several	humiliating	  peace
deals	with	 the	militants,	 pardoning	 Nek	 Mohammed	 and	the	Pakistani	 Taliban
leaders,	offering	  compensation	 for	  their	  losses,	 freeing	 their	  prisoners	 and
allowing	 foreign	 militants	 to	register	 with	 the	authorities	 (none	did).	 A	 vicious
cycle	ensued.	The	army	would	launch	an	offensive	in	 FATA,	 suffer	setbacks	and
heavy	casualties	and	then	 sign	peace	deals	with	 the	 militants	 that	left	 them	 in
control	 of	 the	 territory	  they	 already	 occupied	 and	 sometimes	 of	 even	 more
ground.
       Most	 detrimental	 to	the	government's	cause	was	the	militants’	 campaign	of
terror	against	the	population	of	FATA.	  They	executed	over	300	tribal	elders	who
did	not	 support	them,	killed	  civilians	 and	drove	 out	thousands	of	 families	 who
had	refused	to	back	the	Taliban.	At	no	point	 did	the	army	ever	attempt	to	 protect
Pashtun	civilians	 who	 were	 trying	 to	 resist	 the	 Taliban,	 not	even	 local	 tribal
chiefs	who	tried	to	organize	militias	 against	them.
       In	 FATA	 the	Taliban	set	up	their	own	 courts	and	administration	and	banned
TV,	music	 and	the	Internet.	They	destroyed	schools	for	girls	 while	 madrassas	in
the	area	multiplied.	  Many	  local	 Pashtuns	were	 convinced	 that	 the	army	 was
playing	 a	double	 game,	curbing	 foreign	 militancy	 when	 US	 pressure	to	do	 so
became	too	strong	but	happy	to	see	the	militants	 continue	fighting	  US	troops	in

289
Afghanistan.	 Through	 this	 period	 there	was	 no	coherent	 US	strategy	 towards
FATA	 since	Bush	was	repeatedly	persuaded	by	Musharraf	 that	negotiating	with
the	Taliban	in	FATA	 and	making	peace	accords	were	good	strategies.
       By	 2007	 over	1,500	Pakistani	 soldiers	and	policemen	 had	been	killed	 in	 a
wave	 of	  ambushes	 and	  suicide	  bomb	  attacks	 in	  major	  cities,	  including
Islamabad,	Lahore	and	 Peshawar.	In	December	 2007	two	 dozen	tribal	 militias
and	other	groups	 from	 Punjab	 and	Kashmir	 met	 in	 FATA,	 where	 they	 joined
together	to	 form	 a	new	 organization,	 the	 ‘Tehreek-e-Taliban	 Pakistan’	 (TTP),
Movement	of	 the	Pakistan	Taliban,	led	 by	the	charismatic	35-year-old	 Baitullah
Mehsud	from	 South	Waziristan,	 a	 close	ally	 of	 Al	 Qaeda,	the	Afghan	 Taliban
and	Jalaluddin	 Haqqani.	Mehsud	 had	fought	 for	 the	 Taliban	 in	 the	1990s	and
then	helped	Al	  Qaeda	leaders	escape	from	Afghanistan	 in	 2001.	 He	was	 later
charged	with	assassinating	Benazir	Bhutto	 and	was	held	 responsible	for	dozens
of	suicide	attacks	in	Pakistan.	The	aim	of	 the	TTP	was	to	take	over	Pakistan	and
turn	it	into	 a	sharia	state	ruled	by	the	Taliban.
       FATA	  had	now	become	a	terrorist	centre	and	a	matter	of	grave	international
concern	as	well	 as	a	 major	threat	 to	Pakistan.	 The	TTP	 provided	 training	 and
manpower	for	 the	insurgency	in	 Afghanistan,	 pursued	the	Talibanization	 of	 the
NWFP,	  trained	  extremists	   from	  other	  Pakistani	   provinces,	  guarded	  the
sanctuaries	of	 Al	  Qaeda	and	 trained	 international	  terrorists,	 while	 its	  media
organs	publicized	 these	activities	 worldwide.	  Leaders	in	 London,	 Washington
and	other	world	 capitals	urged	 Musharraf	to	 do	something	 about	the	growth	 of
extremism	in	FATA,	 but	the	army's	response	remained	half-hearted.
       At	  the	same	time	 jihadism	  was	spreading,	 with	 separate	but	coordinated
jihadi	movements	springing	 up	around	the	country.	In	 the	spring	of	 2007	radical
mullahs	took	 over	the	Red	Mosque	 in	Islamabad	 and	announced	their	intention
of	imposing	 sharia	in	the	capital.	 The	Musharraf	 government	refused	to	step	in,
though	the	 radicals	numbered	barely	 a	 dozen.	Months	 later,	in	 July,	 the	 army
was	forced	 to	 attack	the	 mosque,	by	 which	 time	 thousands	of	 heavily	  armed
militants	 had	holed	 up	 inside.	 A	 three-day	 battle	ensued	 in	 which	 a	hundred
people	were	killed.	 The	militants	 who	survived	fed	 to	FATA,	 where	they	vowed
revenge	and	became	the	core	of	 a	new	 group	of	 suicide	bombers	 for	Baitullah
Mehsud.	Punjabi	jihadi	 groups,	who	until	 this	time	 had	focused	only	on	fighting
India	in	Kashmir,	 also	joined	the	Pakistani	Taliban.
       The	 Taliban	 made	 dramatic	 advances	in	 the	summer	 campaign	of	 2008,
entering	the	settled	 areas	of	the	 NWFP	 for	 the	first	 time,	 attacking	 police	and
army	 posts	in	 Kohat,	  Hangu	 and	the	 Swat	 valley.	 The	 military	  came	 under

290
intense	US	pressure	to	move	 more	decisively	 against	them.	On	 6	August,	 after
several	government	officials	 were	killed,	  the	army	finally	  launched	an	attack	in
Bajaur,	promising	 to	clear	the	 tribal	agency	of	 militants	 within	 six	 weeks.	Over
250,000	people	 fed	 Bajaur	 to	  escape	the	army's	 bombing.	  In	 retaliation	 the
extremists	launched	suicide	attacks	around	the	country,	and	there	were	alerts	for
FATA-trained	 terrorists	 in	 Britain,	  Germany,	Spain,	 Denmark	and	 Holland.	 A
year	later	the	army	was	still	in	Bajaur,	 and	it	controlled	only	 half	the	agency.
       Swat	became	another	major	centre	for	the	Taliban.	 Strategically	located	just
120	miles	 north	of	 Islamabad	and	well	 developed,	with	  large	towns,	roads	and
electricity	 despite	its	high	 mountains,	it	 was	an	ideal	new	 base	for	the	militants
for	it	 gave	 them	access	to	the	broad	 fat	lands	 that	extended	beyond	 the	valley
into	 Punjab,	 the	country's	  largest	province.	  In	 Swat	 an	itinerant	  mullah	 and
former	ski	 lift	  operator,	Maulana	 Fazlullah,	 had	set	up	 an	FM	 radio	 station	in
2004	and	begun	broadcasting	infammatory	 Islamic	texts	and	threats	to	the	 state.
The	Musharraf	  government	 never	shut	 his	 station	 down,	 and	 Fazlullah	 soon
attracted	the	attention	 of	 Al	  Qaeda	and	the	 Taliban,	 who	 poured	 in	 men	and
weapons	to	support	him.
       By	 the	time	 the	army	finally	  went	into	 Swat	in	2007,	Fazlullah	 had	a	well-
armed	militia	  and	 multiple	  radio	 stations.	 The	 army	 was	 badly	 mauled	 and
withdrew,	 leaving	 Fazlullah	 in	 virtual	 control	 of	 the	 Swat	valley.	 In	 2008	 the
army	again	invaded	Swat,	 with	12,000	 soldiers,	but	it	 was	again	defeated	by	an
estimated	3,000	 Taliban	 fighters.	 The	 fighting	  forced	 a	mass	 exodus;	over	 a
hundred	schools,	for	 both	 boys	 and	girls,	 were	 blown	 up	by	 the	 Taliban;	 and
there	were	many	civilian	  casualties.	Again	 the	army	withdrew,	  and	the	Taliban
swiftly	 imposed	their	 brutal	interpretation	 of	 sharia,	which	 included	executions,
foggings,	the	destruction	of	 homes,	preventing	women	from	 leaving	their	 homes
and	executing	all	those	who	had	earlier	resisted	them.
       Meanwhile,	 the	growth	 of	extremism	 in	Pakistan	was	partly	 responsible	for
a	 long-running	  political	  crisis	  in	  2007	 between	 Musharraf	  and	 opposition
political	  parties,	  the	 judiciary	   and	 civil	   society	 that	  culminated	  with	  the
assassination	of	Benazir	Bhutto,	who	 had	been	allowed	to	return	 home	after	her
long	exile.	 She	was	killed	 by	 two	 suicide	attackers	(one	shot	 her	and	the	other
blew	up	 her	 car)	on	 27	December,	 just	 days	before	 the	general	elections	 that
Musharraf	 had	 finally	   agreed	to	  were	 due	 to	 be	 held.	 The	 elections	  were
postponed	after	 her	death	but	 took	 place	 in	 February	2008.	 Bhutto's	 Pakistan
Peoples	Party	 came	 to	 power,	  now	 led	 by	  her	 widower,	 Asif	  Ali	   Zardari.
Relations	 between	 President	 Musharraf	  and	  the	 new	  government	 and	  the

291
opposition	continued	 to	deteriorate	until	 he	stepped	down	in	 August	2008,	 after
nearly	a	decade	in	power.	Zardari	was	elected	as	the	new	president.	But	the	army
still	 dominated	 foreign	  policy	 decisions,	 in	 particular	  those	regarding	 policy
towards	Afghanistan	and	India.
       In	 February	2009	 the	NWFP	provincial	  government	and	the	army	signed	a
peace	deal	with	the	Taliban	in	Swat	that	 allowed	sharia	courts	to	be	set	up	in	the
province	 in	 return	 for	 the	 army's	withdrawing	  and	 the	 Taliban's	 disarming	 –
which	  they	   promptly	   refused	  to	  do.	  Despite	  complaints	   by	  Pakistan's
increasingly	 vocal	 civilians	  that	 the	 accord	 was	 a	 major	 capitulation	  to	 the
militants	and	set	a	terrible	 precedent	that	contradicted	the	 rule	of	 law,	President
Zardari	and	the	national	parliament	 signed	the	deal	into	law	 on	14	April	 without
even	 a	 debate.	 Within	  days	  the	 Swati	  Taliban	  took	 control	  of	  the	  local
administration,	 police	 and	education	 in	 the	Swat	 valley	 and	 began	expanding
into	other	districts	 with	 the	clear	intention	 of	 trying	 to	overthrow	 the	Islamabad
government.
       More	  than	 2.5	 million	  refugees	fed	 Swat	 and	 the	 adjoining	 districts	  of
Buner	and	Dir.	The	public	 was	outraged	and	the	government	embarrassed,	while
the	USA	  was	 horrified,	 accusing	 Pakistan	 of	 abandoning	 its	 responsibilities.
Urged	on	by	 international	pressure,	public	 opinion	and	the	 civilian	 government,
the	army	mobilized	and	attacked	Swat	with	much	 larger	forces	than	it	had	sent	in
before,	finally	 driving	 the	Taliban	 out	of	 Swat	in	 June	and	allowing	the	internal
refugees	to	return	home.	But	the	entire	leadership	of	the	Swati	Taliban,	including
some	20	commanders	and	Fazlullah,	managed	to	escape,	and	by	August	they	had
once	again	resumed	their	sporadic	attacks	in	Swat	against	the	security	forces.
       As	 the	 army	 prepared	once	again	 to	 attack	Taliban	 strongholds	 in	 South
Waziristan	in	 October,	the	Taliban	retaliated	 with	 a	devastating	10-day	series	of
suicide	bombings	and	frontal	 attacks	on	 military	 and	police	 personnel	in	all	 the
major	cities	of	Pakistan.	A	 group	of	Taliban	 managed	to	enter	army	headquarters
in	 Rawalpindi	 and	 take	49	 security	 personnel	 hostage,	who	 were	 freed	 by	 a
commando	action	 22	hours	 later.	And	 on	 15	October	 militants	 launched	 three
coordinated	attacks	 on	police	 and	 intelligence	 officials	  in	 Lahore.	Altogether,
more	than	300	people	were	killed	that	 month.	All	 this	came	at	a	time	when	there
was	still	  no	 clear	 direction	  to	 President	 Obama's	 Afghanistan	 and	 Pakistan
strategy,	the	Afghan	 elections	were	still	 in	 doubt	and	there	were	rising	 tensions
between	the	Pakistan	military	and	the	civilian	 government.
       Meanwhile,	  since	  the	 2001	 war	 the	 Afghan	  Taliban	  have	 spread	 out,
creating	many	 different	  groups.	Today	 there	 are	Pakistani	 and	 Central	 Asian

292
Taliban,	 and	 tomorrow	  there	 may	  well	  be	 Indian	  Taliban	 amongst	 Indian
Muslims	 –	all	 inspired	 by	 the	Taliban-Al	  Qaeda-led	war	 against	the	USA	 and
NATO	 in	Afghanistan,	and	all	 determined	to	create	a	Taliban	sharia	state	in	their
own	region.
       Militant	   extremists	 arose	 in	 Central	 Asia	  almost	 immediately	  after	 the
breakup	of	the	 Soviet	Union	 in	 1991,	but	they	 were	never	considered	a	serious
threat	until	 after	2001.	 Wooing	 Russia	and	the	five	 Central	 Asian	states	for	 air
and	supply	bases	was	essential	to	US	strategy	as	America	prepared	for	the	war	in
Afghanistan.	 While	  the	 regimes	of	  Uzbekistan,	 Kazakhstan,	 Kyrgyzstan	 and
Tajikistan	all	 professed	to	want	 to	help	the	USA,	 they	knew	 that	they	could	 not
make	a	move	without	 the	blessing	of	President	Vladimir	  Putin	of	 Russia,	which
still	had	remarkable	influence	 over	the	former	 Soviet	states.	Only	Turkmenistan,
with	 its	foreign	 policy	 of	 declared	neutrality,	 refused	the	US	 request	for	 bases.
The	Central	Asian	 leaders	hoped	that	joining	  the	US	alliance	 would	 strengthen
their	 dwindling	   credibility	  at	  home	 and	 also	 bring	  them	 a	 financial	  gain.
Moreover,	 they	all	 felt	 threatened	by	 the	Taliban,	 as	well	 as	by	 the	growth	 of
Islamic	extremist	movements	in	Central	Asia.
       The	 USA	  was	particularly	  assiduous	in	  its	 advances	toward	 Uzbekistan
because	Washington	needed	Uzbek	airbases	to	 launch	 the	CIA-Special	 Forces
teams	into	Afghanistan.	 In	 response,	Russia	tried	to	block	 the	USA	 and	hosted
its	own	  summit	 of	 Central	 Asian	 leaders	and	 the	 Afghan	 NA,	 attempting	  to
outbid	the	USA	 by	 offers	of	 support	to	help	 the	NA	 defeat	the	Taliban.	 But	the
Central	 Asian	 leaders	 were	 dissatisfed	 with	  the	 Russian	 offers,	 and	 Uzbek
President	Islam	 Karimov	  was	 the	 first	  to	 break	with	  Russia,	 sending	 secret
messages	to	Washington	saying	that	he	was	ready	to	lease	airbases	to	US	forces.
Putin	realized	that	 Russia	could	not	 stop	the	Central	 Asian	leaders	from	 letting
the	Americans	use	their	airbases.
       On	 22	September,	just	 11	days	after	the	 attacks,	Bush	and	Putin	 spoke	on
the	phone	and	sealed	a	deal	 that	would	 allow	 US	 forces	to	 establish	bases	for
their	 troops	at	 Central	 Asian	 airfields.	  Russia	now	 insisted	 only	 that	 the	 US
presence	not	become	 permanent	and	 that	 it	 be	removed	 once	 Al	 Qaeda	was
defeated.	The	CIA	 began	to	 fy	 in	teams	to	 the	massive	Karshi-Khanabad	 (K2)
airbase	in	southern	 Uzbekistan	to	 prepare	for	 their	 incursion	into	 Afghanistan.
By	 mid-October	 2000	US	 troops	were	 stationed	at	 K2.	 Later,	Kyrgyzstan	 and
Tajikistan	also	provided	airbases	to	US	and	NATO	 fighter	jets.
       Before	 11	September	a	handful	of	sporadic	 attacks	into	Central	Asia	 by	the
Islamic	Movement	 of	Uzbekistan	(IMU)	  had	terrified	 the	regimes.	The	IMU,	 led

293
by	military	  commander	Juma	Namangani	 and	ideologue	Tohir	  Yuldeshev,	had
confronted	the	Uzbek	 police	briefly	  in	Namangan	in	 the	Ferghana	valley	 in	the
early	1990s	and	had	then	fed	to	Tajikistan,	 where	they	 fought	with	 the	Islamists
in	the	civil	  war	which	 lasted	from	 1992	 to	1997.	After	 the	 war	ended	the	IMU
leaders	settled	 in	  the	 Pamir	 mountains	 in	 Tajikistan	  and	 launched	 periodic
attacks	into	Kyrgyzstan	and	Uzbekistan.
       In	 the	winter	 of	2000	 the	IMU	 retreated	into	Afghanistan,	 where	they	were
welcomed	by	Osama	Bin	 Laden	and	Mullah	 Omar	 even	as	the	USA	 designated
them	a	 terrorist	  group.	 The	 IMU	  now	 shifted	 ideological	  course,	 no	 longer
seeking	simply	 to	create	an	Islamic	 state	in	Uzbekistan	 but	aiming	 to	 bring	the
whole	of	Central	 Asia	and	even	the	Western	Chinese	province	of	Xinjiang	 under
its	control.	 Namangani	pledged	loyalty	 to	 Mullah	 Omar	and	began	to	 apply	the
Taliban	Islamic	 code	to	his	own	 troops.	He	also	set	up	an	IMU	 training	 camp	in
Kunduz,	 close	to	 the	 border	with	  Tajikistan,	 modelled	 closely	 on	 Al	 Qaeda's
training	 facilities	 and	 encouraged	young	Central	 Asians	 and	Chechens	to	 join
him	there.	 Suddenly	Al	 Qaeda	had	a	 major	 ideological	 ally	 in	 Central	Asia	 as
well	 as	a	key	 partner	 in	 building	 a	 drug	smuggling	  network	 that	could	 move
Afghan	heroin	through	Central	 Asia	into	Russia	and	Europe.
       President	 Karimov	 was	 stunned	when	 he	learned	of	 the	 proximity	  of	 the
IMU	  and	Al	  Qaeda	and	 the	 operational	 centres	they	 had	 established	on	 the
Afghan-Uzbek	 border.	Just	 before	11	 September,	Mullah	 Omar	 had	appointed
Namangani	the	Taliban's	 military	 chief	 for	 all	 of	northern	 Afghanistan	 and	put
him	in	 charge	of	 the	 defence	of	the	 northern	capital	 Mazar-e-Sharif	 When	 the
USA	attacked,	Namangani	was	killed	 in	a	bombing	raid	 just	before	Mazar	fell	 to
US	and	Afghan	forces	in	November	2001.	The	IMU	  was	routed,	and	hundreds	of
its	fighters	were	killed.	 But	 the	remainder,	led	by	Tohir	 Yuldeshev,	 escaped	into
Pakistan,	where	they	took	refuge	in	FATA.	  Some	married	local	Pashtun	women.
Unlike	Al	 Qaeda's	Arabs,	who	had	the	option	of	 returning	to	the	Middle	 East	via
the	underground	 network	 set	up	 by	 sympathetic	 Pakistani	 militants,	 the	 IMU
militants	 could	not	 return	home	for	 fear	 of	persecution	by	 the	authorities.	 As	a
result	they	became	mercenaries	in	FATA,	  lending	 out	their	 military	 prowess	to
the	highest	bidder,	be	it	 Al	 Qaeda,	neo-Taliban	 leaders	like	Jalaluddin	 Haqqani
or	local	 Pakistani	 Pashtun	militia	  leaders.	They	 gained	 an	even	 more	terrible
reputation	than	 that	 of	 other	 extremists	groups	 for	 being	 cruel,	 heartless	and
tough	fighters.
       The	 US	and	European	presence	in	Central	Asia	failed	to	push	Central	Asian
leaders	toward	  desperately	needed	 political	  and	 social	 reforms.	 There	 were

294
several	changes	 of	 face	 at	 the	 top	 of	 the	 power	 structures,	 but	 meaningful
political	 or	  economic	 changes	remained	few	  and	far	  between.	Parliamentary
elections	were	held	in	Kyrgyzstan	 in	 March	2005,	but	 the	opposition	denounced
them	as	rigged	by	the	deeply	 unpopular	President	Askar	Akayev,	 who	 had	been
in	power	since	1991.	After	 violent	 street	demonstrations	and	the	storming	of	 the
presidential	 palace	 Akayev	 was	 overthrown.	  Kurmanbek	 Bakiyev,	  a	 former
colleague	of	Akayev's	and	a	well-known	 establishment	figure,	became	President,
but	he	 too	was	 quickly	 accused	of	 corruption,	 nepotism	 and	 authoritarianism.
Bakiyev	tilted	 towards	Moscow	and	demanded	larger	payments	from	the	USA	 to
keep	its	airbase	close	to	the	capital,	Bishkek.
       In	 Turkmenistan	there	was	a	similar	 change	when	the	autocratic	and	bizarre
President	Saparmurad	Niyazov	died	of	a	heart	attack	in	 December	2006.	He	had
spent	21	years	in	 power	and	left	 the	country	 impoverished,	 even	though	it	 was
rich	 in	  oil	  and	  gas.	 The	 new	  President,	 Gurbanguly	  Berdymuhammedov,
eventually	began	a	very	cautious	and	slow	 policy	 of	reforms	 and	the	opening	of
the	country	to	the	West.
       Uzbekistan,	 the	largest	and	most	populated	country	in	the	region	 which	had
spawned	the	IMU,	underwent	a	long-term	 crisis:	the	government	was	oppressive
and	dictatorial	  and	 was	 interested	in	  neither	 political	  nor	 economic	 reform.
People	speculated	about	whether,	 if	 President	Karimov	  died,	 positive	 changes
would	 follow.	  Some	 feared	that	 it	  would	 lead	 instead	 to	 a	relentless	 power
struggle	between	various	elite	Uzbek	 factions,	which	 only	Karimov	 was	capable
of	 holding	 together.	 With	  Karimov	  in	 power	 the	 President's	 family	  and	 his
cronies	profted	enormously	from	 business	deals,	while	poverty	 visibly	 increased
among	the	people	and	 the	lack	 of	legalized	 political	 parties	 led	to	 a	growth	 of
underground	Islamic	extremism.
       The	  worsening	 conditions	 in	  Uzbekistan	 gave	 rise	 to	 several	 extremist
Islamic	movements.	The	 oldest	was	the	IMU	 but	 the	largest	was	Hizb	 ut-Tahrir
(HT),	 which	 believed	in	 creating	a	 single	worldwide	  Islamic	state	headed	by	 a
Caliph.	 A	 relatively	 new	 movement	 originating	  from	 the	Middle	  East,	 it	 had
become	popular	amongst	young	Muslims	 on	university	 campuses	in	Europe	but
failed	to	have	any	impact	 in	the	Muslim	 world	 except	in	 Central	Asia.	Although
HT	 actively	 promoted	 nonviolence,	 Karimov	 moved	 ruthlessly	 to	 suppress	it,
jailing	 thousands	of	young	people	on	 the	often	false	 charges	that	they	belonged
to	 HT.	 Karimov	   also	 persuaded	the	 USA	  to	 declare	 HT	 a	 terrorist	  group.
Meanwhile,	 differences	 were	 arising	 among	 the	Uzbek	 exiles	 in	  FATA,	  and
another	group	emerged	in	 2002-3	after	 breaking	away	from	 the	 IMU.	 The	new

295
splinter	group	was	called	‘Islamic	  Jihad	Union’,	 and	it	enlisted	militant	 Turks	 as
well	as	Central	Asians	and	was	especially	close	to	Al	Qaeda.
       The	 Union	 was	said	to	be	responsible	for	 the	March	 2004	multiple	 suicide
attacks	in	  several	 cities	 in	  Uzbekistan	 including	  Tashkent.	 Over	 four	  days
suicide	 attacks	  killed	  47	  people.	 The	  Uzbekistan	  government	  closed	 the
country's	borders,	arrested	400	people	and	 forced	Western	reporters	and	 NGOs
to	leave	 the	country.	 In	 July	 more	suicide	 attacks	took	 place	in	 Tashkent	 and
more	arrests	 followed.	  Tensions	mounted,	 especially	 in	 the	 Ferghana	valley,
which	exploded	 on	13	May	 2005	when	a	mass	demonstration	in	 favour	of	 local
businessmen	who	had	been	imprisoned	 was	fred	 upon	 by	troops.	 At	 least	850
people	were	killed	 in	 the	massacre,	although	the	 regime	claimed	 that	only	 187
had	died.	Thousands	more	were	 arrested,	and	many	more	 fed	the	country.	 The
USA	 and	 NATO	  were	forced	  to	 criticize	 Karimov,	  while	  China	 and	Russia
supported	his	actions.	Karimov	reacted	in	July	 by	ordering	the	eviction	 of	all	 US
forces	from	its	K2	 base.8
       The	 crackdown	  in	 Uzbekistan	 further	  benefited	 the	 IMU	  and	extremist
groups	holed	up	 in	FATA	  as	young	 people	fed	 Uzbekistan	to	 avoid	arrest	and
took	 refuge	 in	 FATA.	  Hundreds	 of	 young	 Uzbeks	 travelled	 to	 Pakistan	and
Afghanistan	for	 training,	and	the	traffic	 in	 militants	 between	these	two	countries
and	Central	Asia	multiplied.	  The	several	hundred	IMU	  militants	 who	had	taken
refuge	in	 Pakistan	after	 2001	 had	now	 become	several	thousand,	with	  dozens
travelling	 back	and	forth	to	 Central	Asia	every	 month.	Tohir	 Yuldeshev	became
an	even	more	important	leader.
       Other	   terrorist	  groups	  also	  benefited.	   In	  September	  2007	  German
authorities	 arrested	three	German	 Muslims	 who	  had	trained	 with	 the	 Islamic
Jihad	Union	in	 FATA	  and	then	returned	to	Germany	 intending	to	 bomb	the	US
air-force	base	at	Ramstein.	The	Union,	led	by	 Najmiddin	 Jalolov	(also	known	 as
Abu	Yahya	 Mohammed	 Fatih),	 recruited	widely	  in	Turkey.	 The	 Central	Asian
Taliban	based	in	 FATA	 were	 now	 a	threat	not	 just	to	 Central	Asia	 but	 also	to
Turkey	and	Europe.
       Karimov,	  now	 more	 aware	of	 the	 dangers	posed	by	 the	Taliban	  and	the
IMU,	 in	February	2009	 allowed	the	USA	 and	NATO	 once	more	to	start	sending
goods	into	Afghanistan	via	 Uzbekistan.	By	May	 he	had	agreed	to	allow	the	USA
to	reopen	 a	cargo	 base	in	 Navoi	  in	 order	to	 send	 supplies	into	  Afghanistan,
although	 to	  avoid	  criticism	  that	  he	 had	 surrendered	 to	  US	  demands,	 he
nominated	the	South	Korean	government	 to	run	 the	base.	This	new	alliance	 did
not	hamper	the	IMU,	 and	in	June	a	series	of	small	suicide	 bombings	and	attacks

296
on	police	stations	began	in	the	Ferghana	valley	and	in	other	towns	in	Uzbekistan.
The	 Uzbeks	 angrily	   closed	 their	  borders	 with	  Tajikistan	  and	  Kyrgyzstan,
claiming	 that	 the	militants	 were	 arriving	  from	 Afghanistan	 through	 these	two
countries,	although	it	 was	more	likely	  that	the	militants	 had	already	 established
secret	underground	bases	in	Uzbekistan	itself	from	which	 they	were	preparing	to
launch	larger	attacks.
       The	 spread	of	 the	 Taliban	 as	a	 role	 model	for	  Islamic	 extremism	 in	 the
region,	as	a	militant	 force	to	impose	sharia	and	its	 interpretation	of	 Islam	on	the
population	and	as	an	armed	group	aiming	to	 overthrow	local	 state	structures	has
continued	because	of	the	lack	 of	 resolve	and	policies	 by	 local	 regimes	and	the
international	 community.	  The	 Taliban	 today	 are	 the	 principal	 defenders	 and
protectors	of	Al	 Qaeda	and	its	attempts	to	spread	global	jihad	by	 enticing	young
people	into	 its	 web	 of	 international	 violence	 and	 terrorism.	 The	 Taliban	 will
remain	a	 danger	to	 the	 world	  until	 local	 Muslim	  governments	 and	the	 West
commit	 to	the	 effort	 needed	to	 combat	extremism	 as	well	 as	 to	deal	 with	 the
outstanding	 problems	 of	 poverty,	  economic	 malaise,	 lack	  of	 education	 and
joblessness	amongst	 the	 populations	 of	  the	 region.	 A	  vast	 new	 social	 and
economic	development	programme	is	needed	not	just	in	 Afghanistan	 but	also	in
Pakistan	and	Central	Asia	if	there	is	to	 be	a	long-term	answer	to	the	threat	posed
by	the	Taliban	and	Al	Qaeda	that	emanates	from	the	region.

                    cultural	     issues,	  after	   the	 capture	    of

                                                      1.
Decree	announced	by	the	General	Presidency	of	Amr	Bil	Maruf	and	Nai	Az
Munkar	(Religious	Police.)	Kabul,	November	1996.
      Women	you	should	not	step	outside	your	residence.	If	you	go	outside	the
house	you	should	not	be	like	women	who	used	to	go	with	fashionable	clothes
wearing	much	cosmetics	and	appearing	in	front	of	every	men	before	the	coming
of	Islam.
      Islam	as	a	rescuing	religion	has	determined	specific	dignity	for	women,
Islam	has	valuable	instructions	for	women.	Women	should	not	create	such
opportunity	to	attract	the	attention	of	useless	people	who	will	not	look	at	them
with	a	good	eye.	Women	have	the	responsibility	as	a	teacher	or	coordinator	for
her	family.	Husband,	brother,	father	have	the	responsibility	for	providing	the
family	with	the	necessary	life	requirements	(food,	clothes	etc).	In	case	women
are	required	to	go	outside	the	residence	for	the	purposes	of	education,	social
needs	or	social	services	they	should	cover	themselves	in	accordance	with	Islamic
Sharia	regulation.	If	women	are	going	outside	with	fashionable,	ornamental,
tight	and	charming	clothes	to	show	themselves,	they	will	be	cursed	by	the
Islamic	Sharia	and	should	never	expect	to	go	to	heaven.
      All	 family	elders	and	every	Muslim	have	responsibility	in	this	respect.	We
request	all	family	elders	to	keep	tight	control	over	their	families	and	avoid	these
social	problems.	Otherwise	these	women	will	be	threatened,	investigated	and
severely	punished	as	well	as	the	family	elders	by	the	forces	of	the	Religious
Police	(Munkrat).
      The	Religious	Police	(Munkrat)have	the	responsibility	and	duty	to	struggle
against	these	social	problems	and	will	continue	their	effort	until	evil	is	finished.

15.	This	 account	is	 based	on	several	 interviews	 with	 UN	 officials	  and	Masud
himself	in	 1996	and	1997.	 There	are	also	reports	that	Najibullah	  was	hoping	to

necessary	because	he	was	responsible	for	the	massacre	of	thousands	of	Afghans,
Razaq	said.	Mullah	Omar	appointed	Razaq	commander	of	the	Taliban	forces	that
captured	Kabul	in	 1996.	He	was	captured	by	 Dostum's	troops	in	 Mazar	in	May,

1.	Pakistani	diplomatic	 sources	told	me	that	Pakistan	had	provided	Dostum	 with
US$10	million	 dollars	in	a	bid	 to	persuade	him	to	ally	with	 the	Taliban.	Iran	paid
him	similar	 sums	to	keep	him	opposed	to	the	Taliban.
2.	Levine,	Steve,	Enemies	of	Enemies,	Newsweek,21	October	1996.
3.	Dostum	had	summoned	Malik	 to	Mazar	from	 the	Baghdis	front	but	he	refused
to	go	 saying	 that	 Dostum	 would	 kill	  him.	 That	 was	the	 trigger	 for	 the	 coup
against	Dostum,	 a	senior	 Pakistani	General	 told	 me	 in	 Islamabad	on	 19	May
1997.
4.	Pakistan's	Foreign	Minister	 Gohar	 Ayub	 issued	a	statement	on	25	May	 1997
extending	recognition	 and	stating	that	the	crisis	 in	Afghanistan	 was	now	 solved
as	the	Taliban	  had	formed	 a	 broad-based	government.	 We	 feel	 that	 the	new
government	 fulfils	  all	 criteria	  for	  de	jurerecognition.	  It	  is	 now	 in	  effective
control	of	 most	of	the	territory	 of	 Afghanistan	 and	is	representative	of	all	ethnic
groups	in	 that	 country,	 said	Ayub.	 Within	  hours	 of	 the	statement	the	 Taliban
were	forced	out	of	Mazar.
5.	The	Taliban	 captured	Ismael	 Khan	 and	some	700	of	 his	 fighters	after	 Khan
had	been	invited	 to	 a	dinner	 by	Malik	  who	 then	allowed	 the	Taliban	 to	 arrest
him.	 Betraying	 a	 guest	in	 your	  home	is	 anathema	for	  Afghans.	 See	Rashid,
Ahmed,	550	 Pakistani	 students	captured	by	 Afghan	 opposition,	 the	 Nation,14
July	1997.
6.	According	 to	 interviews	with	  officials	 from	 the	UN	 and	the	ICRC	 in	 Kabul,
July	1997,	Malik	 held	 1,000	Taliban	 in	Maimana,	 1,000	in	Sheberghan	and	800
in	Mazar.	 Masud	held	 between	600	and	 700	prisoners	in	 the	Panjshir.	 General
Naderi's	Ismaeli	forces	north	 of	the	 Salang	tunnel	held	100	Taliban	 and	Hizb-e-

347
Wahadat	held	  around	 100	 Taliban.	  According	  to	 the	 UN,	  Malik	  held	 200
Pakistanis	in	Mazar,	 another	225	in	 Maimana	while	 Masud	held	 100	Pakistanis
in	the	Panjshir	valley	and	Khalili	 held	nearly	 50.

         Introduction


         The ideas herein presented stem, Ior the most part, Irom my day-to-
day clinical  worN with  patients as they strXggled to avoid or to  gain ever
greater levels oI  matXrity.  ConseTXently, this booN contains portions  oI
many  actXal case  histories.  ConIidentiality   is   essential to   psychiatric
practice, and all case descriptions, thereIore, have been altered in name and
in other particXlars so as to preserve the anonymity oI my patients withoXt
distorting the essential reality oI oXr e[perience with each other.
         There may, however, be some distortion by virtXe oI the brevity oI the
case presentations. Psychotherapy is seldom a brieI  process, bXt since I
have, oI necessity, IocXsed on the highlights oI a case, the reader may be
leIt with  the impression that  the process is one oI drama and clarity.  The
drama is  real and  clarity  may  eventXally be achieved,  bXt it  shoXld be
remembered that in  the  interest  oI  readability,  accoXnts oI  the lengthy
periods oI  conIXsion and IrXstration inherent  in  most therapy have been
omitted Irom these case descriptions.
         I woXld also liNe to apologize Ior  continXally reIerring to God in  the
traditionally   mascXline image,  bXt  I  have  done  so  in   the  interest  oI
simplicity rather than Irom any rigidly held concept as to gender.
         As a psychiatrist,  I Ieel  it  is important to  mention at the oXtset two
assXmptions that Xnderlie this  booN. One  is that  I  maNe no  distinction
between the mind and the spirit,  and thereIore no distinction  between the
process oI achieving spiritXal growth  and achieving mental growth.  They
are one and the same.
         The other assXmption is that this process is a comple[,  ardXoXs and
liIelong tasN. Psychotherapy, iI it is to provide sXbstantial assistance to the
process oI mental and spiritXal growth, is not a TXicN or simple procedXre. I
do not belong to any particXlar school oI psychiatry or psychotherapy; I am
not simply a FreXdian or JXngian or Adlerian or behaviorist or  gestaltist. I
do not believe there are any single easy answers. I believe that brieI Iorms
oI psychotherapy may be helpIXl and are not to be decried, bXt the help they
provide is inevitably sXperIicial.

5
         The MoXrney oI spiritXal growth is a long one. I woXld  liNe to thanN
those oI my  patients who  have given  me the privilege  oI  accompanying
them Ior  maMor portions oI their MoXrney. For their MoXrney has also been
mine, and mXch oI what is presented here is what we have learned together.
I woXld also  liNe to thanN many oI my  teachers and colleagXes. Principal
among them is  my  wiIe,  Lily.   She has been so giving   that it  is  hardly
possible to distingXish her wisdom as a spoXse, parent, psychotherapist, and
person Irom my own.

         Problems     and  Pain


         LiIe is diIIicXlt.
         This is a great trXth, one oI the greatest trXths. *
         *The  first   of the  “Four  Noble  Truths”  which  Buddha  taught  was
“Life is suffering.”

         It is a great trXth becaXse once we trXly see this trXth, we transcend it.
Once we trXly  Nnow that liIe  is  diIIicXlt—once  we  trXly Xnderstand and
accept it—then liIe  is no longer diIIicXlt.  BecaXse once it is accepted, the
Iact that liIe is diIIicXlt no longer matters.
         Most do not IXlly see this trXth that liIe is diIIicXlt. Instead they moan
more or  less  incessantly, noisily  or  sXbtly, aboXt the  enormity  oI  their
problems, their bXrdens, and their diIIicXlties as iI liIe were generally easy,
as iI liIe should be easy. They voice their belieI, noisily or sXbtly, that their
diIIicXlties represent a XniTXe Nind oI aIIliction that shoXld not be and that
has somehow been especially visited Xpon them, or else Xpon their Iamilies,
their tribe, their class, their nation, their race or even their species, and not
Xpon others. I Nnow aboXt this moaning becaXse I have done my share.
         LiIe is a series oI problems. Do we want to moan aboXt them or solve
them? Do we want to teach oXr children to solve them?
         Discipline is the basic set oI tools we reTXire to solve liIe’s problems.
:ithoXt   discipline we can solve nothing. :ith   only  some discipline we can
solve only some problems. :ith  total discipline we can solve all problems.
         :hat    maNes liIe  diIIicXlt   is  that  the  process oI   conIronting  and
solving problems is a painIXl one. Problems, depending Xpon their natXre,
evoNe in Xs IrXstration or grieI or sadness or loneliness or gXilt or regret or
anger or Iear  or an[iety   or  angXish or despair. These are XncomIortable
Ieelings, oIten very XncomIortable, oIten as painIXl as any Nind oI physical
pain, sometimes eTXaling the very worst Nind oI physical pain. Indeed, it is
because oI the pain that events or conIlicts engender in Xs all that we call
them problems. And since liIe  poses an endless series oI problems, liIe is
always diIIicXlt and is IXll oI pain as well as Moy.

8
         Yet it  is in this  whole process oI meeting and solving problems that
liIe  has  its  meaning. Problems  are  the  cXtting edge  that  distingXishes
between sXccess and IailXre.  Problems call  Iorth   oXr coXrage and  oXr
wisdom; indeed, they create oXr coXrage and oXr wisdom. It is only becaXse
oI  problems that  we grow  mentally  and  spiritXally.  :hen    we  desire to
encoXrage the growth oI the hXman spirit, we challenge and encoXrage the
hXman capacity to solve  problems, MXst as in school we deliberately  set
problems Ior oXr children to solve. It is throXgh the pain oI conIronting and
resolving problems that we learn. As BenMamin FranNlin said, “Those things
that hXrt, instrXct.” It is  Ior this  reason that wise people learn not to dread
bXt actXally to  welcome  problems and actXally  to  welcome the  pain oI
problems.
         Most oI Xs are not so wise. Fearing the pain involved, almost all oI Xs,
to a greater or lesser degree, attempt to avoid problems. :e  procrastinate,
hoping that they will  go  away. :e   ignore them, Iorget them, pretend they
do not e[ist.  :e   even taNe drXgs to assist Xs in ignoring them, so that by
deadening oXrselves to the pain we can Iorget the problems that caXse the
pain. :e   attempt to sNirt aroXnd problems rather than meet them head on.
:e   attempt to get oXt oI them rather than sXIIer throXgh them.
         This tendency to avoid problems and the emotional sXIIering inherent
in them is the primary  basis oI all hXman mental illness. Since most oI Xs
have this tendency to a greater or lesser degree, most oI Xs are mentally ill
to a greater or lesser degree, lacNing complete mental health. Some oI Xs
will   go  to  TXite e[traordinary   lengths  to  avoid  oXr  problems  and the
sXIIering they caXse, proceeding Iar aIield Irom all that is clearly good and
sensible in order to try to Iind an easy way oXt, bXilding the most elaborate
Iantasies in which to live, sometimes to the total e[clXsion oI reality. In the
sXccinctly elegant words oI Carl JXng, “NeXrosis is always a sXbstitXte Ior
legitimate sXIIering.” *
         *  Collected  Works  2f  C.  G.  Jung, Bollingen  Ser., No.  20, 2d  ed.
(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1973), trans. R. F. C. Hull,  Vol II,
Psychology and Religion: West and East, 75.

         BXt the  sXbstitXte itselI Xltimately  becomes more  painIXl than  the
legitimate sXIIering it  was designed to avoid. The neXrosis itselI becomes
the biggest problem. TrXe to Iorm, many will then attempt to avoid this pain

9
and this problem in tXrn, bXilding layer Xpon layer oI neXrosis. FortXnately,
however, some possess the coXrage to  Iace their  neXroses and begin—
XsXally with   the  help  oI   psychotherapy—to  learn  how  to   e[perience
legitimate sXIIering. In  any case, when we  avoid the legitimate  sXIIering
that resXlts Irom  dealing  with  problems, we  also avoid  the  growth  that
problems demand Irom Xs. It is Ior this reason that in chronic mental illness
we stop growing, we become stXcN. And withoXt healing, the hXman spirit
begins to shrivel.
         ThereIore let Xs incXlcate in oXrselves and in oXr children the means
oI  achieving  mental and  spiritXal  health.  By  this  I   mean let  Xs  teach
oXrselves and oXr children the necessity Ior sXIIering and the valXe thereoI,
the need to Iace problems directly  and to e[perience  the pain involved.  I
have stated that discipline is the basic set oI tools we reTXire to solve liIe’s
problems. It will  become clear that these tools are techniTXes oI sXIIering,
means by which we e[perience  the pain oI  problems in sXch a way  as to
worN them throXgh and solve them sXccessIXlly, learning and growing in
the process. :hen   we teach oXrselves and oXr children discipline, we are
teaching them and oXrselves how to sXIIer and also how to grow.
         :hat    are these tools, these techniTXes oI sXIIering, these means oI
e[periencing  the pain  oI  problems  constrXctively  that I   call  discipline?
There are  IoXr:  delaying   oI  gratiIication,   acceptance oI  responsibility,
dedication to trXth, and balancing. As will be evident, these are not comple[
tools whose application demands e[tensive training.  To the contrary, they
are simple tools, and almost all children are adept in their Xse by the age oI
ten. Yet presidents and Nings will  oIten  Iorget to  Xse them, to their  own
downIall. The problem  lies not in  the comple[ity  oI  these tools bXt in the
will  to Xse them. For  they are tools with  which  pain is  conIronted rather
than avoided, and iI one seeNs to avoid legitimate sXIIering, then one will
avoid the Xse oI these tools. ThereIore, aIter analyzing each oI these tools,
we shall in the ne[t section e[amine the will to Xse them, which is love.

         Delaying     Gratification


         Not too long  ago a thirty-year-old Iinancial  analyst was complaining
to me over a  period oI months aboXt her tendency to procrastinate in  her

10
Mob. :e had worNed throXgh her Ieelings aboXt her employers and how they
related to Ieelings aboXt aXthority in general, and to her parents speciIically.
:e   had e[amined  her  attitXdes toward worN and sXccess and how these
related to her marriage, her se[Xal identity, her desire to compete with her
hXsband, and her Iears oI sXch competition. Yet despite all this standard and
painstaNing psychoanalytic worN, she continXed to procrastinate as mXch as
ever. Finally, one day, we dared to looN at the obvioXs. “Do yoX liNe caNe?”
I asNed her. She replied that she did. “:hich   part  oI the caNe do yoX liNe
better,” I   went  on, “the  caNe or  the  Irosting?”  “Oh,   the Irosting!”   she
responded enthXsiastically. “And  how  do  yoX  eat  a piece  oI  caNe?” I
inTXired, Ieeling that I mXst be the most inane psychiatrist that ever lived. “I
eat the Irosting Iirst, oI coXrse,” she replied. From her caNe-eating habits we
went on to e[amine her worN habits, and, as was to be e[pected, discovered
that on any given day she woXld devote the Iirst hoXr to the more gratiIying
halI  oI  her   worN and  the  remaining  si[    hoXrs getting  aroXnd  to  the
obMectionable remainder. I sXggested that iI she were to Iorce  herselI to
accomplish the Xnpleasant part oI her Mob dXring the Iirst hoXr, she woXld
then be Iree to enMoy the other si[. It seemed to me, I said, that one hoXr oI
pain Iollowed  by  si[  oI  pleasXre was preIerable to one  hoXr oI  pleasXre
Iollowed by si[  oI  pain. She agreed, and, being basically a person oI strong
will, she no longer procrastinates.
         Delaying gratiIication is a process oI schedXling the pain and pleasXre
oI  liIe   in   sXch  a  way  as  to   enhance the  pleasXre  by  meeting  and
e[periencing the pain Iirst and getting it over with. It is the only decent way
to live.
         This tool  or process oI schedXling is learned by most children  TXite
early in  liIe,  sometimes as early as age Iive. For  instance, occasionally a
Iive-year-old when playing a game with  a companion will  sXggest that the
companion taNe Iirst tXrn, so that the child might enMoy his or her tXrn later.
At age si[   children may  start eating their caNe Iirst  and the Irosting  last.
ThroXghoXt grammar school this  early  capacity to  delay  gratiIication  is
daily e[ercised, particXlarly throXgh the perIormance oI homeworN. By the
age oI  twelve  some children  are already  able to  sit  down  on  occasion
withoXt any parental prompting and complete their homeworN beIore they
watch television. By the age oI IiIteen or si[teen  sXch behavior is e[pected
oI the adolescent and is considered normal.

11
         It  becomes clear  to  their   edXcators at this  age,  however,  that  a
sXbstantial nXmber oI adolescents Iall Iar short oI this norm.  :hile    many
have a  well-developed  capacity  to  delay  gratiIication,   some  IiIteen-or
si[teen-year-olds seem to have hardly developed this capacity at all; indeed,
some seem even  to  lacN the  capacity  entirely.  These are  the  problem
stXdents. Despite average or better intelligence, their grades are poor simply
becaXse they do not worN. They sNip classes or sNip school entirely on the
whim oI  the  moment. They are impXlsive,  and their  impXlsiveness spills
over into their social liIe as well. They get into IreTXent Iights, they become
involved with  drXgs, they begin to get in troXble with the police. Play now,
pay later,  is  their  motto. So  the  psychologists and psychotherapists are
called in.  BXt most  oI  the time  it  seems too late. These adolescents are
resentIXl oI any attempt to intervene in their liIe style oI impXlsiveness, and
even when this resentment can be overcome by warmth and Iriendliness and
a nonMXdgmental attitXde on the part oI the therapist, their impXlsiveness is
oIten  so  severe that  it  preclXdes their   participation  in   the process  oI
psychotherapy in any meaningIXl way. They miss their appointments. They
avoid all important and painIXl issXes. So XsXally the attempt at intervention
Iails, and these children drop  oXt oI school, only  to continXe a pattern oI
IailXre that IreTXently lands them in  disastroXs marriages, in accidents, in
psychiatric hospitals or in Mail.
         :hy     is  this?  :hy      do  a  maMority develop  a  capacity  to  delay
gratiIication while a sXbstantial minority Iail,  oIten irretrievably, to develop
this capacity. The answer is not absolXtely, scientiIically Nnown. The role oI
genetic Iactors is Xnclear. The variables cannot be sXIIiciently controlled Ior
scientiIic prooI. BXt most oI  the signs rather clearly point to the TXality oI
parenting as the determinant.

         The  Sins   of  the  Father


         It is not that the homes oI these XnselI-disciplined children are lacNing
in  parental discipline  oI  a  sort. More  oIten  than  not these children  are
pXnished IreTXently and  severely  throXghoXt their  childhood—slapped,
pXnched, NicNed, beaten and whipped by   their  parents Ior  even  minor

12
inIractions. BXt this  discipline is  meaningless. BecaXse it is Xndisciplined
discipline.
         One reason that it is  meaningless, is that the parents themselves are
XnselI-disciplined, and thereIore serve as Xndisciplined role models Ior their
children.  They are  the  “Do  as  I  say, not  as  I  do”  parents.  They  may
IreTXently get drXnN in Iront oI  their  children. They  may Iight  with  each
other in ¬Iront oI  the children withoXt restraint, dignity or rationality.  They
may be slovenly. They maNe promises they don’t Neep. Their own lives are
IreTXently and obvioXsly  in  disorder and disarray,  and their  attempts to
order the lives oI their children seem thereIore to maNe little sense to these
children. II  Iather beats Xp mother regXlarly, what sense does it maNe to a
boy when his mother  beats him Xp becaXse he beat Xp his sister? Does it
maNe sense when he’s told that he mXst learn to control his temper? Since
we do not have the beneIit oI comparison when we are yoXng, oXr parents
are godliNe IigXres to oXr childish eyes. :hen   parents do things a certain
way, it seems to the yoXng child the way to do them, the way they shoXld be
done. II  a child  sees his parents day in  and day  oXt behaving with  selI-
discipline, restraint, dignity and a capacity to order their own lives, then the
child will  come to Ieel in the deepest Iibers oI his being that this is the way
to live.  II  a child sees his parents day in and day  oXt living  withoXt selI-
restraint or selI-discipline, then he will  come in the deepest Iibers oI being
to believe that that is the way to live.
         Yet even  more important  than role  modeling  is  love.  For even  in
chaotic and disordered homes  genXine love is  occasionally present, and
Irom sXch homes may come selI-disciplined children. And not inIreTXently
parents who are proIessional people—doctors, lawyers,  clXb women and
philanthropists—who lead lives  oI  strict orderliness and decorXm bXt yet
lacN love,  send children   into  the  world  who  are  as Xndisciplined  and
destrXctive and disorganized as any child Irom an impoverished and chaotic
home.
         Ultimately  love is everything. The mystery oI  love will  be e[amined
in later  portions oI  this  worN. Yet, Ior  the  saNe oI coherency, it may  be
helpIXl to  maNe a brieI  bXt limited  mention  oI  it  and its  relationship to
discipline at this point.
         :hen   we love  something it is oI valXe to Xs, and when something is
oI valXe to Xs we spend time with it, time enMoying it and time taNing care

13
oI it.  Observe a teenager. In love  with  his car  and note the time  he will
spend admiring it,  polishing it,  repairing  it, tXning  it. Or  an older  person
with a beloved rose garden, and the time spent prXning and mXlching and
Iertilizing  and stXdying it. So it  is  when we love children;  we spend time
admiring them and caring Ior them. :e give them oXr time. .
         Good discipline  reTXires time. :hen    we  have no time  to  give oXr
children, or no time that we are willing to give, we don’t even observe them
closely enoXgh to become aware oI  when their  need Ior oXr disciplinary
assistance is e[pressed sXbtly. II their need Ior discipline is so gross as to
impinge  Xpon oXr conscioXsness, we may  still  ignore  the  need on  the
groXnds that it’s easier to let them have their own way—“I  MXst don’t have
the energy to deal  with  them today.”  Or, Iinally,  iI  we  are impelled  into
action by their misdeeds and oXr irritation, we will impose discipline, oIten
brXtally, oXt  oI   anger rather  than  deliberation,  withoXt  e[amining   the
problem or even taNing the time to consider which Iorm oI discipline is the
most appropriate to that particXlar problem.
         The parents who  devote time to  their  children even when  it  is not
demanded by glaring   misdeeds will   perceive in  them  sXbtle needs Ior
discipline, to  which they will   respond with gentle Xrging  or reprimand or
strXctXre or praise, administered with thoXghtIXlness and care. They will
observe how their children eat caNe, how they stXdy, when they tell sXbtle
Ialsehoods, when they rXn away Irom problems rather than Iace them. They
will   taNe the  time  to   maNe these minor   corrections  and adMXstments,
listening  to  their  children,  responding to  them,  tightening  a little   here,
loosening a little  there, giving them little  lectXres, little  stories, little  hXgs
and Nisses, little admonishments, little pats on the bacN.
         So it  is  that the  TXality oI  discipline  aIIorded by  loving  parents is
sXperior to the discipline oI Xnloving parents. BXt this is MXst the beginning.
In taNing the  time  to  observe and to  thinN aboXt their  children’s needs,
loving parents will  IreTXently agonize over the decisions to be made, and
will,  in a very real sense, sXIIer along with their children. The children are
not blind  to this. They  perceive it when their  parents are willing  to sXIIer
with them,  and althoXgh they may not respond with  immediate gratitXde,
they will  learn also to sXIIer. “II my parents are willing  to sXIIer with me,”
they will  tell themselves, “then sXIIering mXst not be so bad, and I shoXld
be willing to sXIIer with myselI.”  This is the beginning oI selI-discipline.

14
         The time and the TXality oI the time that their parents devote to them
indicate to children  the degree to which  they are valXed by their  parents.
Some basically Xnloving parents, in  an attempt to  cover Xp their  lacN oI
caring, maNe IreTXent proIessions oI love to their children, repetitively and
mechanically telling  them  how  mXch they  are valXed, bXt not  devoting
signiIicant time  oI  high  TXality to  them. Their  children are never  totally
deceived by  sXch hollow   words. ConscioXsly  they may  cling   to  them,
wanting to  believe that they are loved,  bXt XnconscioXsly they Nnow that
their parents’ words do not match Xp with their deeds.
         On the other hand, children who are trXly loved, althoXgh in moments
oI  piTXe  they  may  conscioXsly  Ieel  or  proclaim   that  they  are  being
neglected, XnconscioXsly Nnow themselves to be valXed. This Nnowledge is
worth more than any  gold. For when  children Nnow that they are valXed,
when they trXly  Ieel valXed in  the deepest parts oI themselves, then they
Ieel valXable.
         The Ieeling oI being valXable—“I am a valXable person”—is essential
to mental health and is a cornerstone oI selI-discipline. It is a direct prodXct
oI  parental love.  SXch a  conviction  mXst be  gained in  childhood;  it  is
e[tremely   diIIicXlt   to  acTXire  it   dXring  adXlthood.  Conversely,  when
children have learned throXgh the love oI their parents to Ieel valXable, it is
almost impossible Ior the vicissitXdes oI adXlthood to destroy their spirit.
         This  Ieeling  oI  being  valXable  is  a cornerstone oI   selI-discipline
becaXse when one considers oneselI valXable one will taNe care oI oneselI
in all ways that are necessary. SelI-discipline is selI-caring. For instance—
since we are discXssing the process oI delaying gratiIication, oI schedXling
and ordering time—let Xs e[amine the matter oI time.  II we  Ieel oXrselves
valXable, then we will Ieel oXr time to be valXable, and iI we’ Ieel oXr time
to be valXable, then we will want to  Xse it well. The Iinancial  analyst who
procrastinated did  not  valXe her  time.  II  she had,  she woXld  not  have
allowed herselI to spend most oI her day so Xnhappily and XnprodXctively.
It was not  withoXt conseTXence Ior her that throXghoXt her childhood she
was “Ianned oXt” dXring all school vacations to live with paid Ioster parents
althoXgh her parents coXld have taNen care oI her perIectly well had they
wanted to. They did not valXe her. They did not want to care Ior her. So she
grew Xp Ieeling herselI to be oI little  valXe, not worth caring Ior; thereIore
she did not  care Ior herselI.  She did not  Ieel she was worth  disciplining

15
herselI. Despite the Iact that she was an intelligent and competent woman
she reTXired the most elementary instrXction in selI-discipline becaXse she
lacNed a realistic assessment oI her own worth and the valXe oI  her own
time. Once she was able to perceive her time as being valXable, it natXrally
Iollowed that she wanted to organize it and protect it  and maNe ma[imXm
Xse oI it.
         As a  resXlt oI the e[perience  oI consistent parental love  and caring
throXghoXt childhood, sXch IortXnate children will enter adXlthood not only
with a deep internal sense oI their own valXe bXr also with a deep internal
sense oI secXrity. All children are terriIied oI abandonment, and with good
reason. This Iear oI abandonment begins aroXnd the age oI si[ months, as
soon as the child is able to perceive itselI to be an individXal, separate Irom
its parents. For  with  this perception oI  itselI  as an  individXal comes the
realization that as an individXal  it is  TXite helpless, totally dependent and
totally at the mercy oI its  parents Ior all Iorms oI  sXstenance and means oI
sXrvival. To the child, abandonment by its parents is the eTXivalent oI death.
Most parents, even when they are otherwise relatively ignorant or calloXs,
are instinctively sensitive to  their children’s Iear oI  abandonment and will
thereIore day in and day oXt, hXndreds and thoXsands oI times, oIIer; their
children needed reassXrance: “YoX Nnow Mommy and Daddy aren’t going
to leave yoX behind”; “OI coXrse Mommy and Daddy will come bacN to get
yoX”;  “Mommy  and  Daddy  aren’t going  to  Iorget  aboXt yoX.”  II   these
words are matched by deeds, month in and month oXt, year in and year oXt,
by the time oI adolescence the child will have lost the Iear oI abandonment
and in its stead will have a deep inner Ieeling that the world is a saIe place
in which  to  be and protection will   be there when  it is  needed. :ith    this
internal sense oI the consistent saIety oI the world,  sXch a child is Iree to
delay gratiIication oI one Nind or another, secXre in the Nnowledge that the
opportXnity  Ior  gratiIication,   liNe  home  and  parents, is   always  there,
available when needed.
         BXt many  are  not  so IortXnate. A   sXbstantial nXmber oI  children
actXally are abandoned by  their  parents dXring childhood,  by  death, by
desertion, by sheer negligence, or, as in the case oI the Iinancial analyst, by
a simple lacN oI caring. Others, while not abandoned in Iact, Iail to receive
Irom their  parents the reassXrance that they will not be abandoned. There
are some parents, Ior  instance, with  their desire to  enIorce discipline  as

16
easily and TXicNly as possible, will actXally Xse the threat oI abandonment,
overtly  or  sXbtly, to  achieve  this  end. The  message they give  to  their
children is: “II  yoX don’t do e[actly what I  want yoX to do I won’t love yoX
anymore, and yoX can IigXre  oXt Ior  yoXrselI what that  might  mean.” It
means, oI coXrse, abandonment and death. These parents sacriIice love in
their need Ior control and domination over their  children, and their reward
is children  who  are e[cessively  IearIXl oI  the  IXtXre. So it  is  that these
children, abandoned either psychologically or in actXality, enter adXlthood
lacNing any deep sense that the world is a saIe and protective place. To the
contrary, they perceive the world as dangeroXs and Irightening, and they are
not aboXt to  IorsaNe any gratiIication   or secXrity  in  the present Ior  the
promise oI greater gratiIication or secXrity in the IXtXre, since Ior them the
IXtXre seems dXbioXs indeed.
         In   sXmmary,  Ior    children   to   develop   the   capacity   to   delay
gratiIication, it is  necessary Ior them to have selI-disciplined role models, a
sense oI selI-worth, and a degree oI  trXst in the saIety oI  their  e[istence.
These “possessions” are ideally  acTXired throXgh the selI-discipline  and
consistent, genXine caring oI their parents; they are the most precioXs giIts
oI themselves that mothers and Iathers can beTXeath. :hen these giIts have
not been proIIered  by one’s  parents, it is  possible to  acTXire them Irom
other soXrces, bXt in that case the process oI their acTXisition is invariably
an Xphill strXggle, oIten oI liIelong dXration and oIten XnsXccessIXl.

         Problem-SolYing        and  Time


         Having toXched Xpon some oI the ways in which parental love or its
lacN may inIlXence the development oI selI-discipline  in  general, and the
capacity to delay gratiIication in particXlar, let Xs e[amine some oI the more
sXbtle  yet  TXite  devastating  ways   in   which   diIIicXlties   in   delaying
gratiIication  aIIect   the  lives   oI   most  adXlts.  For  while   most  oI   Xs,
IortXnately, develop sXIIicient  capacity  to delay  gratiIication  to  maNe it
throXgh high school or college and embarN Xpon adXlthood withoXt landing
in Mail, oXr development nonetheless tends to be imperIect and incomplete,
with the resXlt that oXr ability to solve liIe’s  problems is still imperIect and
incomplete.

17
         At  the age oI thirty-seven  I  learned how to Ii[   things.  Prior to  that
time almost all my attempts to maNe minor plXmbing repairs, mend toys or
assemble bo[ed IXrnitXre  according to  the  accompanying hieroglyphical
instrXction sheet ended in conIXsion, IailXre and IrXstration. Despite having
managed to maNe it throXgh medical school and sXpport a Iamily as a more
or less sXccessIXl e[ecXtive and psychiatrist, I considered myselI  to be a
mechanical idiot. I was convinced I was deIicient in some gene, or by cXrse
oI natXre lacNing some mystical TXality responsible Ior mechanical ability.
Then one day at the end oI  my  thirty-seventh year, while  taNing a spring
SXnday walN, I happened Xpon a neighbor in the process oI repairing a lawn
mower. AIter greeting him I  remarNed, “Boy, I sXre admire yoX. I’ve never
been able to Ii[ those Nind oI things or do anything liNe that.” My neighbor,
withoXt a moment’s hesitation, shot bacN, “That’s becaXse yoX don’t taNe
the time.”   I   resXmed my  walN,  somehow disTXieted by   the  gXrX-liNe
simplicity,  spontaneity  and  deIinitiveness  oI  his   response. “YoX  don’t
sXppose he coXld be right, do yoX?” I asNed myselI. Somehow it registered,
and the ne[t time the opportXnity presented itselI to maNe a minor repair I
was able to remind myselI to taNe my time. The parNing braNe was stXcN on
a patient’s car, and she Nnew that there was something one coXld do Xnder
the dashboard to release it, bXt she didn’t  Nnow what. I  lay down  on the
Iloor below  the Iront seat oI her car. Then I  tooN the time to maNe myselI
comIortable. Once I  was comIortable, I  then tooN the time to  looN at the
sitXation. I looNed Ior several minXtes. At  Iirst  all I  saw was a conIXsing
MXmble oI wires and tXbes and rods, whose meaning I did not Nnow. BXt
gradXally, in no hXrry, I was able to IocXs my sight on the braNe apparatXs
and trace its coXrse. And then it became clear to me that there was a little
latch preventing the braNe Irom being released. I slowly stXdied this latch
Xntil it became clear to me that iI  I were to  pXsh it Xpward with the tip  oI
my Iinger it  woXld move easily and woXld release the braNe. And so I did
this. One single  motion, one oXnce oI  pressXre Irom a Iingertip,  and the
problem was solved. I was a master mechanic!
         ActXally, I don’t  begin to have the Nnowledge or the time to gain that
Nnowledge to be able to Ii[  most mechanical IailXres, given the Iact that I
choose to concentrate my time on nonmechanical matters. So I still XsXally
go rXnning to the nearest repairman. BXt I now Nnow that this is a choice I
maNe, and   I   am  not   cXrsed  or   genetically   deIective   or   otherwise

18
incapacitated or impotent. And  I Nnow that I  and anyone else who is  not
mentally deIective can solve any problem iI we are willing to taNe the time.
         The issXe is important, becaXse many people simply do not taNe the
time  necessary to  solve  many  oI  liIe’s   intellectXal,  social  or  spiritXal
problems, MXst as I did not taNe the time  to  solve mechanical problems.
BeIore my  mechanical enlightenment I  woXld have awNwardly stXcN my
head Xnder the dashboard oI my patient’s car, immediately yanNed at a Iew
wires withoXt having the Ioggiest idea oI what I was doing, and then, when
nothing  constrXctive  resXlted, woXld   have  thrown  Xp  my   hands  and
proclaimed “It’s beyond me.” And this  is precisely the way that so many oI
Xs approach other  dilemmas  oI  day-to-day  living.   The  aIorementioned
Iinancial analyst was a  basically loving  and dedicated bXt rather helpless
mother to her two yoXng children. She was alert and concerned enoXgh to
perceive when her children were having some sort oI emotional problem or
when something was not  worNing oXt  in  her child-raising.  BXt  then she
inevitably tooN one oI  two coXrses oI action with  the children:  either she
made the very Iirst change that came to her mind within a matter oI seconds
—maNing them  eat  more  breaNIast or  sending  them  to  bed  earlier—
regardless oI whether sXch a change had anything to do with the problem,
or else  she came to  her  ne[t  therapy  session with  me (the  repairman),
despairing: “It’s beyond me. :hat   shall I do?”  This woman had a perIectly
Neen and analytical mind, and when she didn’t procrastinate, she was TXite
capable oI solving comple[ problems at worN. Yet when conIronted with a
personal problem, she behaved as iI she were totally lacNing in intelligence.
The issXe was one oI time. Once she became aware oI a personal problem,
she Ielt so discomIited that she demanded an immediate solXtion, and she
was not  willing   to  tolerate  her discomIort   long  enoXgh to  analyze the
problem. The solXtion to  the problem represented gratiIication to her, bXt
she was Xnable to delay this gratiIication  Ior  more than a minXte or  two,
with the resXlt that her solXtions were XsXally inappropriate and her Iamily
in chronic  tXrmoil. FortXnately, throXgh her own  perseverance in therapy
she was gradXally able to learn how to  discipline herselI  to taNe the time
necessary to analyze Iamily problems so as to develop well-thoXght-oXt and
eIIective solXtions.
         :e    are not  talNing here aboXt esoteric deIects  in  problem-solving
associated only with people who clearly maniIest psychiatric distXrbances.

19
The Iinancial   analyst  is  everyman. :ho     among  Xs can  say  that  they
XnIailingly devote sXIIicient time to  analyzing their children’s problems or
tensions within the Iamily? :ho    among Xs is so selI-disciplined that he or
she never says resignedly in the Iace oI Iamily problems, “It’s beyond me”?
         ActXally, there is  a deIect in  the approach to problem-solving more
primitive and more destrXctive than impatiently inadeTXate attempts to Iind
instant solXtions, a deIect even more XbiTXitoXs and Xniversal. It is the hope
that problems will  go  away oI  their own  accord. A  thirty-year-old  single
salesman in groXp  therapy in  a  small  town  began to  date the  recently
separated wiIe oI another groXp member, a banNer. The salesman Nnew the
banNer to be a chronically angry man who was deeply resentIXl oI his wiIe’s
leaving him. He Nnew that he was not being honest either with the groXp or
with the banNer by not conIiding his relationship with the banNer’s wiIe. He
also Nnew that it was almost inevitable that sooner or later the banNer woXld
learn aboXt the continXing relationship. He Nnew that the only solXtion to
the problem woXld be to conIess the relationship to the groXp and bear the
banNer’s anger with the groXp’s sXpport. BXt he did  nothing.  AIter  three
months the banNer IoXnd oXt aboXt the Iriendship, was predictably enraged,
and Xsed the incident to TXit  his therapy. :hen    conIronted by  the groXp
with his destrXctive behavior the salesman said: “I Nnew that talNing aboXt
it woXld be a hassle, and I gXess I Ielt that iI I  did nothing, maybe I  coXld
get away with it  withoXt the hassle. I gXess I thoXght that iI I  waited long
enoXgh the problem might go away.”
         Problems do not go away. They mXst be worNed throXgh or else they
remain, Iorever a barrier to the growth and development oI the spirit.
         The groXp made the salesman aware in no  Xncertain terms that his
tendency to avoid problem-solving by ignoring a problem in the hope that it
woXld go away was in  itselI his  maMor problem. FoXr months later, in the
early aXtXmn, the salesman IXlIilled a Iantasy by rather sXddenly TXitting
his sales Mob and starting his own IXrnitXre-repair bXsiness, which woXld not
reTXire him to travel. The groXp deplored the Iact that he was pXtting all his
eggs in one basNet and also TXestioned the wisdom oI maNing the move
with  winter  coming  on, bXt  the salesman assXred them he woXld maNe
enoXgh to get by in  his new  bXsiness. The sXbMect was dropped. Then in
early FebrXary he annoXnced that he woXld have to TXit the groXp becaXse
he coXld no longer pay the Iee. He was dead broNe and woXld have to start

20
looNing Ior  another Mob. In Iive months  he had repaired a  total oI  eight
pieces oI IXrnitXre. :hen    asNed why he hadn’t  started looNing Ior a  Mob
sooner, he replied: “I  Nnew si[ weeNs ago that I was rXnning throXgh my
money Iast, bXt  somehow I  coXldn’t  believe that  it  woXld come  to  this
point. The whole  thing  MXst didn’t seem very Xrgent, bXt, boy, it’s Xrgent
now.” He had, oI coXrse, ignored his problem. Slowly it  began to dawn on
him that Xntil he solved his problem oI  ignoring problems he woXld never
get beyond step one—even with all the psychotherapy in the world.
         This   inclination   to   ignore   problems   is   once   again  a   simple
maniIestation  oI   an  Xnwillingness  to   delay  gratiIication.   ConIronting
problems is, as I have said, painIXl. To willingly  conIront a problem early,
beIore we are Iorced to  conIront  it by  circXmstances, means to pXt aside
something pleasant  or  less  painIXl  Ior   something  more  painIXl.  It   is
choosing to  sXIIer  now  in  the  hope  oI  IXtXre gratiIication   rather  than
choosing to continXe present gratiIication in the hope that IXtXre sXIIering
will not be necessary
         It  may seem that the salesman who ignored sXch obvioXs problems
was emotionally immatXre or  psychologically  primitive,  bXt, again, I  tell
yoX he is everyman and his immatXrity and primitiveness e[ist in Xs all. A
great general, commander oI an army, once told me, “The  single greatest
problem in this army, or I gXess in any organization, is that most e[ecXtives
will  sit  looNing at problems in  their  Xnits, staring them right  in  the Iace,
doing nothing,  as iI   these problems will   go away  iI  they  sit there  long
enoXgh.” The general wasn’t talNing aboXt the mentally weaN or abnormal.
He was talNing aboXt other generals and senior  colonels, matXre men oI
proven capability and trained in discipline.
         Parents are e[ecXtives, and despite the Iact that they are XsXally ill-
prepared Ior  it,  their  tasN can  be  every bit   as comple[   as directing  a
company or corporation. And  liNe the army e[ecXtives,  most parents will
perceive problems  in  their   children  or  in   their  relationship  with   their
children Ior  months or years beIore they taNe any eIIective action, iI  they
ever do. “:e    thoXght maybe he woXld grow oXt oI it,”   the parents say as
they come to the child psychiatrist with  a problem oI  Iive  years’ dXration.
And  with  respect Ior  the  comple[ity   oI  parenting, it   mXst be said  that
parental decisions are diIIicXlt, and that children oIten do “grow oXt oI it.”
BXt it almost never hXrts to try to help them grow oXt oI it or to  looN more

21
closely at the problem. And while children oIten “grow oXt oI it,” oIten they
do not; and as with so many  problems, the longer children’s problems are
ignored, the larger they become and the more painIXl and diIIicXlt to solve.

         Responsibility


         :e    cannot  solve  liIe’s   problems  e[cept   by  solving   them.  This
statement may  seem  idiotically    taXtological  or  selI-evident,   yet  it   is
seemingly beyond the comprehension oI mXch oI the hXman race. This is
becaXse we mXst accept responsibility Ior a problem beIore we can solve it.
:e   cannot solve a  problem by  saying “It’s  not  my problem.”  :e    cannot
solve a problem by hoping that someone else will solve it Ior Xs. I can solve
a problem only when I  say “This is my problem  and it’s Xp to me to solve
it.”  BXt many, so many, seeN to avoid the pain oI their problems by saying
to themselves: “This problem was caXsed me by other people, or by social
circXmstances beyond my control, and thereIore it is Xp to other people or
society to solve this problem Ior me. It is not really my personal problem.”
         The e[tent to which people will  go psychologically to avoid assXming
responsibility Ior personal problems, while always sad, is sometimes almost
lXdicroXs. A  career sergeant in  the  army, stationed  in  ONinawa and in
serioXs troXble  becaXse oI   his   e[cessive  drinNing,   was  reIerred  Ior
psychiatric evalXation and, iI possible, assistance. He denied that he was an
alcoholic, or even that his  Xse oI alcohol was a personal problem, saying,
“There’s nothing else to do in the evenings in ONinawa e[cept drinN.”
         “Do yoX liNe to read?” I asNed.
         “Oh yes, I liNe to read, sXre.”
         “Then why don’t yoX read in the evening instead oI drinNing.”
         “It’s  too noisy to read in the barracNs.”
         “:ell,    then, why don’t yoX go to the library?”
         “The library is too Iar away.”
         “Is the library Iarther away than the bar yoX go to?”
         “:ell,    I’m  not mXch oI a reader. That’s not where my interests lie.”
         “Do yoX liNe to Iish?” I then inTXired.
         “SXre, I love to Iish.”
         “:hy    not go Iishing instead oI drinNing?”

22
         “BecaXse I have to worN all day long.”
         “Can’t yoX go Iishing at night?”
         “No, there isn’t any night Iishing in ONinawa.”
         “BXt there is,”  I said. “I  Nnow several organizations that Iish at night
here. :oXld  yoX liNe me to pXt yoX in toXch with them?”
         “:ell,    I really don’t liNe to Iish.”
         “:hat    I hear yoX saying,” I clariIied, “is  that there are other things to
do in ONinawa e[cept drinN, bXt the thing yoX liNe to do most in ONinawa is
drinN.”
         “Yeah, I gXess so.”
         “BXt yoXr drinNing  is getting yoX in  troXble, so yoX’re Iaced with  a
real problem, aren’t yoX?”
         “This damn island woXld drive anyone to drinN.”
         I  Nept trying   Ior  a  while,  bXt  the sergeant was  not  the least  bit
interested in seeing his drinNing as a personal problem which he coXld solve
either with  or withoXt  help, and I  regretIXlly  told his  commander that he
was not   amenable to  assistance. His  drinNing  continXed,  and he  was
separated Irom the service in mid-career.
         A  yoXng wiIe,  also in  ONinawa, cXt her  wrist  lightly  with  a  razor
blade and was broXght to the emergency room, where I saw her. I asNed her
why she had done this to herselI.
         “To Nill myselI, oI coXrse.”
         “:hy    do yoX want to Nill yoXrselI?”
         “BecaXse I can’t stand it  on this dXmb island. YoX have to send me
bacN to the  States. I’m  going  to Nill  myselI  iI   I  have to  stay here  any
longer.”
         “:hat    is  it  aboXt living   in  ONinawa that’s so  painIXl Ior  yoX?”  I
asNed. She began to cry in a whining sort oI way. “I don’t have any Iriends
here, and I’m alone all the time.”
         “That’s  too  bad. How   come yoX  haven’t  been able  to  maNe any
Iriends?”
         “BecaXse I have to live in a stXpid ONinawan hoXsing area, and none
oI my neighbors speaN English.”
         “:hy    don’t  yoX drive  over to  the American  hoXsing area or to the
wives’ clXb dXring the day so yoX can maNe some Iriends?”
         “BecaXse my hXsband has to drive the car to worN.”

23
         “Can’t yoX drive him  to worN, since yoX’re alone and bored all day?”
I asNed.
         “No.  It’s a sticN-shiIt car, and I don’t Nnow how to drive a sticN-shiIt
car, only an aXtomatic.”
         “:hy    don’t yoX learn how to drive a sticN-shiIt car?”
         She glared at me. “On these roads? YoX mXst be crazy.”

         Neuroses    and   Character      Disorders


         Most people who come to see a psychiatrist are sXIIering Irom what is
called either a neXrosis or a character disorder. PXt most simply, these two
conditions are disorders oI  responsibility,  and as  sXch they are opposite
styles oI relating to  the world and its  problems. The neXrotic assXmes too
mXch responsibility;  the  person with   a  character disorder, not  enoXgh.
:hen   neXrotics are in  conIlict  with  the world  they aXtomatically assXme
that they are at IaXlt.  :hen   those with  character disorders are in conIlict
with the world they aXtomatically assXme that the world is at IaXlt. The two
individXals MXst described had character disorders: the sergeant Ielt that his
drinNing was ONinawa’s IaXlt,  not his,  and the wiIe   also saw herselI  as
playing no role whatsoever in her own isolation. A neXrotic woman, on the
other  hand, also  sXIIering  Irom   loneliness and  isolation   on  ONinawa,
complained: “I drive  over to the Non-Commissioned OIIicers’  :ives   ClXb
every day to looN Ior Iriendship,  bXt I don’t  Ieel at ease there. I thinN that
the other wives don’t liNe me. Something mXst be wrong with me. I shoXld
be able to maNe Iriends more easily. I oXght to be more oXtgoing. I want to
Iind  oXt what it  is  aboXt me that maNes me so XnpopXlar.” This woman
assXmed total responsibility Ior her loneliness, Ieeling she was entirely  to
blame. :hat   she IoXnd oXt in  the coXrse oI therapy was that  she was an
XnXsXally intelligent and ambitioXs person and that she was ill at ease with
the other sergeants’ wives, as well as with  her hXsband, becaXse she was
considerably more intelligent and ambitioXs than they. She became able to
see that her loneliness while her problem, was not necessarily dXe to a IaXlt
or deIect  oI  her own.  Ultimately   she was divorced,  pXt herselI  throXgh
college while raising her children, became a magazine editor, and married a
sXccessIXl pXblisher.

24
         Even  the  speech patterns  oI  neXrotics  and  those with   character
disorders are diIIerent.   The speech oI  the  neXrotic  is  notable Ior   sXch
e[pressions as “I  oXght to,”  “I  shoXld,”  and “I  shoXldn’t,”  indicating  the
individXal’s selI-image as an inIerior man or woman, always Ialling short oI
the marN, always maNing the wrong choices. The speech oI a person with a
character disorder, however, relies heavily  on  “I   can’t,”  “I  coXldn’t,”   “I
have to,” and “I had to,”  demonstrating a selI-image oI a being who has no
power oI choice, whose behavior is completely directed by e[ternal  Iorces
totally  beyond  his   or  her  control.   As   might  be  imagined,   neXrotics,
compared with   character-disordered people, are  easy to   worN with   in
psychotherapy becaXse they assXme responsibility Ior their diIIicXlties and
thereIore  see  themselves as   having  problems.   Those  with   character
disorders are mXch more diIIicXlt, iI not  impossible, to worN with becaXse
they don’t  see themselves as the soXrce oI  their  problems; they  see the
world rather than themselves as being in need oI change and thereIore Iail
to  recognize   the  necessity   Ior   selI-e[amination.   In   actXality,   many
individXals have both a neXrosis and a character disorder and are reIerred to
as “character neXrotics,” indicating that in some areas oI their lives they are
gXilt-ridden by  virtXe oI  having  assXmed responsibility that is  not really
theirs,  while   in  other  areas  oI  their   lives   they  Iail   to  taNe  realistic
responsibility Ior themselves. FortXnately, once having established the Iaith
and trXst oI sXch individXals in the psychotherapy process throXgh helping
them with the neXrotic part oI their personalities, it is oIten possible then to
engage them in  e[amining  and correcting  their  Xnwillingness to  assXme
responsibility where appropriate.
         Few oI Xs can escape being neXrotic or character disordered to at least
some  degree  (which   is  why    essentially  everyone  can  beneIit   Irom
psychotherapy iI he or she is serioXsly willing to participate in the process).
The reason Ior this is  that the problem oI  distingXishing what we are and
what we are not responsible Ior in this liIe is one oI the greatest problems oI
hXman e[istence. It is never completely solved; Ior the entirety oI oXr lives
we mXst continXally assess and reassess where oXr responsibilities lie in the
ever-changing coXrse oI events. Nor is  this assessment and reassessment
painless iI  perIormed adeTXately and conscientioXsly. To  perIorm either
process adeTXately we mXst possess the willingness and the capacity  to
sXIIer continXal selI-e[amination. And  sXch capacity or willingness is  not

25
inherent in any oI Xs. In a sense all children have character disorders, in that
their instinctXal tendency is to deny their responsibility  Ior  many conIlicts
in  which  they  Iind  themselves. ThXs two  siblings  Iighting   will   always
blame each other Ior initiating the Iight and each will totally deny that he or
she may have been the cXlprit. Similarly, all children have neXroses, in that
they will   instinctXally  assXme responsibility Ior  certain deprivations that
they e[perience bXt do not yet Xnderstand. ThXs the child who is not loved
by his parents will always assXme himselI or herselI to be Xnlovable rather
than see  the  parents  as deIicient   in  their   capacity  to  love.  Or   early
adolescents who are  not  yet  sXccessIXl at dating  or  at  sports will   see
themselves as serioXsly deIicient hXman beings rather than the late or even
average bXt  perIectly  adeTXate bloomers they  XsXally  are.’  It  is   only
throXgh a   vast  amoXnt  oI   e[perience  and  a   lengthy  and  sXccessIXl
matXration that we gain the capacity  to see the world  and oXr place in  it
realistically, and thXs are enabled to realistically  assess oXr responsibility
Ior oXrselves and the world.
         There is  mXch that  parents can do  to  assist their  children  in  this
matXration process. OpportXnities present themselves thoXsands oI times
while children are growing  Xp when parents can either conIront them with
their tendency to avoid or escape responsibility Ior their own actions or can
reassXre them that certain sitXations are not their IaXlt. BXt to seize these
opportXnities, as  I   have  said,  reTXires oI   parents sensitivity   to   their
children’s needs and the willingness  to taNe the time and maNe the oIten
XncomIortable eIIort to meet these needs. And this in tXrn reTXires love and
the willingness to assXme appropriate responsibility Ior the enhancement oI
their children’s growth. 
         Conversely, even above and beyond simple insensitivity  or  neglect,
there is  mXch that  many  parents do  to  hinder  this matXration  process.
NeXrotics, becaXse oI their willingness  to  assXme responsibility, may be
TXite e[cellent parents iI their neXroses are relatively mild and they are not
so overwhelmed by Xnnecessary responsibilities that they have scant energy
leIt Ior  the  necessary responsibilities oI parenthood. Character-disordered
people, however, maNe disastroXs parents, blissIXlly Xnaware that they oIten
treat their children  with  vicioXs destrXctiveness. It is  said that “neXrotics
maNe themselves miserable; those with character disorders maNe everyone
else miserable.” ChieI among the people character disordered parents maNe

26
miserable are their children.  As  in other  areas oI their  lives, they  Iail  to
assXme adeTXate responsibility Ior their parenting. They tend to brXsh oII
their children  in  thoXsands oI little   ways rather than  provide  them with
needed attention. :hen their children are delinTXent or are having diIIicXlty
in school, character-disordered parents will aXtomatically lay the blame on
the  school system  or  on   other  children  who,  they  insist,   are a  “bad
inIlXence”  on  their  own  children.  This  attitXde, oI   coXrse, ignores the
problem. BecaXse they  dXcN responsibility, character-disordered parents
serve as role models oI irresponsibility  Ior  their children.  Finally,  in their
eIIorts  to  avoid  responsibility  Ior   their  own  lives,  character-disordered
parents will oIten lay  this responsibility Xpon their children: “YoX  Nids are
driving me nXts,” or “The only reason I stay married to yoXr Iather [mother]
is becaXse oI yoX Nids,” or  “YoXr  mother’s a  nervoXs wrecN becaXse oI
yoX,” or “I  coXld have gone to college and been a sXccess iI it weren’t Ior
having to sXpport yoX.”  In sXch ways these parents in eIIect  say to their
children, “YoX are responsible Ior  the TXality oI my  marriage, my mental
health and my lacN oI sXccess in liIe.” Since they lacN the capacity to see
how inappropriate this is, the children will   oIten accept this responsibility,
and insoIar as they do  accept it, they  will  become neXrotic. It  is in  sXch
ways that character-disordered parents almost invariably prodXce character-
disordered or neXrotic children. It is the parents themselves who visit their
sins Xpon their children.”
         It  is  not  simply  in   their  role  as parents that  character-disordered
individXals  are ineIIective   and  destrXctive; these  same character traits
XsXally e[tend  to   their  marriages, their   Iriendships  and their   bXsiness
dealings—to any  area oI   their  e[istence  in  which  they  Iail   to  assXme
responsibility Ior  its TXality. This  is inevitable since, as has been said, no
problem can be solved  Xntil an  individXal  assXmes the responsibility Ior
solving it.  :hen    character-disordered individXals blame someone else—a
spoXse, a child, a Iriend, a parent, an employer—or  something else—bad
inIlXences, the  schools,  the   government, racism,   se[ism,  society,  the
“system”—Ior  their  problems, these problems  persist. Nothing  has been
accomplished.  By   casting   away   their   responsibility   they   may   Ieel
comIortable with themselves, bXt they have ceased to solve the problems oI
living,  have ceased to grow spiritXally, and have become dead weight Ior
society. They have cast their ‘ pain  onto society. The saying oI the si[ties

27
(attribXted to Eldridge Cleaver) speaNs to all oI Xs Ior all time: “II  yoX are
not part oI the solXtion, then yoX are part oI the problem.”

         Escape   from    Freedom


         :hen   a psychiatrist maNes the diagnosis oI a character disorder, it is
becaXse the pattern oI avoidance oI responsibility is relatively gross in the
diagnosed individXal. Yet almost all oI Xs Irom time to time seeN to avoid—
in ways that  can be TXite sXbtle—the pain oI assXming responsibility Ior
oXr own problems. For the cXre oI my own sXbtle character disorder at the
age oI  thirty  I  am indebted  to Mac  Badgely.  At  the  time Mac  was  the
director oI  the  oXtpatient psychiatric  clinic  where I  was  completing my
psychiatry residency training. In this clinic  my Iellow  residents and I were
assigned new patients on rotation. Perhaps becaXse I was more dedicated to
my patients and  my  own edXcation than most  oI  my Iellow   residents, I
IoXnd myselI worNing mXch longer  hoXrs than they. They ordinarily  saw
patients only once a  weeN. I oIten saw my  patients two  or three times  a
weeN. As a resXlt I woXld watch my  Iellow  residents leaving the clinic  at
IoXr-thirty  each aIternoon Ior   their  homes, while  I  was  schedXled with
appointments Xp to eight or nine o’clocN at night, and my  heart was Iilled
with resentment. As I became more and more resentIXl and more and more
e[haXsted I  realized that  something had  .to  be done.  So I  went  to  Dr.
Badgely and e[plained the sitXation to him. I wondered whether I might be
e[empted Irom  the rotation oI  accepting new patients Ior a Iew  weeNs so
that I might have time to catch Xp. Did he thinN that was Ieasible? Or coXld
he thinN oI some other solXtion to  the problem? Mac listened to  me very
intently and receptively, not interrXpting once. :hen   I was Iinished aIter  a
moment’s silence, he said to me very sympathetically’, “:ell,  I  can see that
yoX do have a problem.”
         I  beamed, Ieeling Xnderstood. “ThanN yoX,”  I  said. “:hat     do yoX
thinN shoXld be done aboXt it?”
         To this Mac replied, “I told yoX, Scott, yoX do have a problem.”
         This  was  hardly  the  response I  e[pected.  “Yes,”   I  said,  slightly
annoyed, “I Nnow I have a problem. That’s why I came to see yoX. :hat do
yoX thinN I oXght to do aboXt it?”

28
         Mac  responded: “Scott,  apparently yoX haven’t  listened to  what  I
said. I   have heard  yoX, and  I  am  agreeing with   yoX. YoX  do  have a
problem.”
         “Goddammit,”  I said, “I  Nnow I have a problem. I  Nnew that when I
came in here. The TXestion is, what am I going to do aboXt it?”
         “Scott,”  Mac replied, “I  want  yoX to listen. Listen closely  and I will
say it again.  I agree with  yoX. YoX do  have a problem. SpeciIically,  yoX
have a problem with time. Your time. Not my time. It’s not my problem. It’s
your problem with  your time.  YoX, Scott PecN, have a problem with yoXr
time. That’s all I’m going to say aboXt it.”
         I tXrned and strode oXt oI Mac’s oIIice, IXrioXs. And I stayed IXrioXs.
I hated Mac  Badgely. For  three months I  hated him. I  Ielt  that he had  a
severe character disorder. How else coXld he be so calloXs? Here I had gone
to him hXmbly asNing Ior MXst a little bit oI help, a little  bit oI  advice, and
the bastard wasn’t even willing to assXme enoXgh responsibility even to try
to help me, even to do his Mob as director oI the clinic. II he wasn’t sXpposed
to help manage sXch problems as director oI the clinic, what the hell was he
sXpposed to do?
         BXt aIter three months I  somehow came to see that Mac  was right,
that it  was I,  not  he, who  had the  character disorder. My  time  Zas  my
responsibility. It was Xp to me and me alone to decide how I wanted to Xse
and order my  time. II  I  wanted to  invest my  time more heavily  than my
Iellow   residents  in   my   worN,   then  that   was   my   choice,  and   the
conseTXences oI that choice were my responsibility. It might be painIXl Ior
me to  watch my  Iellow   residents leave their  oIIices  two  or three  hoXrs
beIore me, and it might be painIXl  to listen to my  wiIe’s  complaints that I
was not devoting myselI sXIIiciently to the Iamily, bXt these pains were the
conseTXence oI a choice that I had made. II I did not want to sXIIer them,
then I  was Iree to  choose not to  worN so hard and to  strXctXre my time
diIIerently. My worNing hard was not a bXrden cast Xpon me by hardhearted
Iate or a hardhearted clinic director; it was the way I had chosen to live my
liIe and order my  priorities. As  it happened, I chose not to change my liIe
style. BXt with my change in attitXde, my resentment oI my Iellow residents
vanished. It simply  no  longer made any sense to resent them  Ior having
chosen a liIe  style  diIIerent  Irom   mine when  I  was  completely Iree  to

29
choose to be liNe them iI I wanted to. To resent them was to resent my own
choice to be diIIerent Irom them, a choice that I was happy with.
         The diIIicXlty  we•  have in accepting responsibility  Ior  oXr behavior
lies in the desire to avoid the pain oI the conseTXences oI that behavior. By
reTXesting Mac Badgely to assXme responsibility Ior  the strXctXre oI my
time I was attempting to avoid the pain oI worNing long hoXrs, even thoXgh
worNing long  hoXrs was an inevitable  conseTXence oI my choice  to. be
dedicated to  my  patients and  my  training.  Yet  in  so doing  I   was also
Xnwittingly seeNing to increase Mac’s aXthority over me. I was giving him
my power, my Ireedom. I was saying in eIIect, “TaNe charge oI me. YoX be
the boss!”  :henever    we  seeN to  avoid  the responsibility   Ior  oXr  own
behavior, we do so by attempting to give  that responsibility to  some other
individXal or organization or entity. BXt this  means we then give away oXr
power to  that entity,  be it   “Iate”  or  “society”  or  the  government or  the
corporation or oXr boss. It is Ior this reason that Erich Fromm so aptly titled
his  stXdy  oI  Nazism   and  aXthoritarianism  Escape from   Freedom.  In
attempting to avoid  the pain  oI  responsibility, millions  and  even billions
daily attempt to escape Irom Ireedom.
         I have a brilliant  bXt morose acTXaintance who, when I allow him to,
will   speaN Xnceasingly and eloTXently  oI  the  oppressive Iorce   in  oXr
society:  racism,  se[ism,   the  military-indXstrial   establishment,  and  the
coXnty police who picN on him  and his Iriends becaXse oI their long hair.
Again and again I have tried to  point oXt to him  that he is not a child.  As
children, by virtXe oI  oXr real and e[tensive dependency, oXr parents have
real and e[tensive power over Xs. They are, in Iact, largely responsible Ior
oXr well-being, and we are, in Iact, largely at their mercy. :hen  parents are
oppressive, as so oIten they are, we as children are largely powerless to do
anything aboXt it;   oXr choices are  limited.  BXt  as adXlts, when  we are
physically healthy, oXr choices are almost Xnlimited.
         That does not mean they are not painIXl.  FreTXently oXr choices lie
between the lesser oI two evils, bXt it is still within oXr power to maNe these
choices. Yes, I  agree with my  acTXaintance, there are indeed oppressive
Iorces at worN within the world. :e    have, however, the Ireedom to choose
every step oI the way the manner in which we are going to respond to and
deal with these Iorces. It is his choice to live in an area oI the coXntry where
the police don’t liNe “long-haired types” and still grow his hair long. He has

30
the Ireedom to  move  to  the city,  or  to  cXt his  hair, or  even to  wage a
campaign Ior the oIIice oI  police commissioner. BXt despite his brilliance,
he does not acNnowledge these Ireedoms. He chooses to lament his lacN oI
political  power instead oI accepting and e[Xlting  in his immense personal
power. He speaNs oI his love oI Ireedom and oI the oppressive Iorces that
thwart it, bXt every time he speaNs oI how he is victimized by these Iorces
he actXally is giving  away his Ireedom. I  hope that someday soon he will
stop resenting liIe simply becaXse some oI its choices are painIXl.*
         *  Nowhere, to my  knowledge, is the issue of the freedom to  choose
between two evils more eloquently and even poetically defined than by the
psychiatrist Allen Wheelies, in the chapter “Freedom and Necessity” in his
book How   People Change  (New  York:  Harper  &   Row, 1973).  It   was
tempting to quote the chapter in its entirety, and I recommend it to anyone
who desires to explore the issue more fully.

         Dr. Hilde  BrXch, in the preIace to her booN Learning Psychotherapy,
states that basically all  patients come to psychiatrists with  “one  common
problem: the sense oI helplessness, the Iear and inner conviction oI being
Xnable to ‘cope’ and to change things.” †
         †Cambridge, Mass., Harvard Univ. Press, 1974, p. ix.

         One oI  the  roots  oI  this “sense  oI  impotence”  in  the maMority oI
patients is some desire to partially  or  totally  escape the pain oI Ireedom,
and, thereIore, some IailXre, partial or total, to accept responsibility Ior their
problems and their  lives. They  Ieel  impotent becaXse they have, in Iact,
given their power away. Sooner or later, iI they are to be healed, they mXst
learn that the  entirety oI  one’s adXlt  liIe  is a  series oI personal choices,
decisions. II they can accept this totally, then they become Iree people. To
the e[tent  that they  do  not accept this  they will   Iorever  Ieel themselves
victims.

         Dedication      to  Reality


         The third  tool oI  discipline or  techniTXe oI dealing with  the pain oI
problem-solving, which mXst continXally be employed iI oXr lives are to be

31
healthy and oXr spirits are to grow, is dedication to the trXth. SXperIicially,
this shoXld be obvioXs. For trXth is reality. That which is Ialse is Xnreal. The
more clearly we see the reality oI the world,  the better eTXipped we are to
deal with the world.  The less clearly  we see the reality oI  the world—the
more oXr minds are beIXddled by Ialsehood, misperceptions and illXsions—
the less able we will   be to determine correct coXrses oI action and maNe
wise decisions. OXr view oI reality is liNe a map with which to negotiate the
terrain oI liIe. II the map is trXe and accXrate, we will generally Nnow where
we are, and iI  we  have decided where we want  to go,  we will   generally
Nnow how to get there. II the map is Ialse and inaccXrate, we generally will
be lost.
         :hile    this is obvioXs, it is something that most people to a greater or
lesser degree choose to ignore. They ignore it becaXse oXr roXte to reality is
not easy. First oI all, we are not born with maps; we have to maNe them, and
the maNing reTXires eIIort.  The more  eIIort  we  maNe to appreciate and
perceive reality, the larger and more accXrate oXr maps will be. BXt many
do not  want  to  maNe this  eIIort.   Some stop  maNing it  by  the  end  oI
adolescence. Their maps are small and sNetchy, their views oI  the world
narrow and misleading. By the end oI  middle age most people have given
Xp the eIIort.   They Ieel  certain  that  their  maps are complete  and their
:eltanschaXXng is correct (indeed, even sacrosanct), and they are no longer
interested in new inIormation. It  is as iI  they are tired. Only a relative and
IortXnate Iew continXe Xntil the moment oI death e[ploring the mystery oI
reality, ever enlarging and reIining and redeIining their Xnderstanding oI the
world and what is trXe. . .
         BXt the biggest problem oI  map-maNing is not that we have to  start
Irom scratch, bXt that iI oXr maps are to be accXrate we have to continXally
revise them.   The  world  itselI   is   constantly  changing. Glaciers  come,
glaciers go. CXltXres come, cXltXres go. There is too little technology, there
is too  mXch technology. Even more dramatically, the  vantage point Irom
which we view  the world  is  constantly and TXite rapidly changing. :hen
we  are children   we  are  dependent, powerless. As   adXlts we  may  be
powerIXl. Yet in illness or an inIirm old age we may become powerless and
dependent again. :hen    we  have children   to  care Ior,  the  world  looNs
diIIerent Irom  when we have none; when we are raising inIants, the world
seems diIIerent Irom when we are raising adolescents. :hen  we  are poor,

32
the world looNs diIIerent Irom  when we are rich. :e    are daily bombarded
with new inIormation as to the natXre oI reality. II we are to incorporate this
inIormation,  we mXst continXally  revise oXr maps, and  sometimes when
enoXgh new  inIormation  has  accXmXlated, we mXst  maNe very  maMor
revisions. The process oI maNing revisions, particXlarly maMor revisions, is
painIXl, sometimes e[crXciatingly painIXl. And herein lies the maMor soXrce
oI many oI the ills oI manNind.
         :hat    happens when  one has striven  long  and  hard to  develop  a
worNing view oI the world,  a seemingly XseIXl, worNable map, and then is
conIronted with new inIormation sXggesting that that view is wrong and the
map needs  to  be  largely  redrawn?  The  painIXl  eIIort   reTXired seems
Irightening, almost  overwhelming. :hat    we do  more oIten  than not, and
XsXally XnconscioXsly, is to ignore the new inIormation.
         OIten  this  act  oI  ignoring   is  mXch more  than  passive. :e    may
denoXnce the new inIormation as Ialse, dangeroXs, heretical, the worN oI
the  devil.  :e     may  actXally  crXsade against  it,   and  even  attempt  to
manipXlate the world so as to maNe it conIorm to oXr view oI reality. Rather
than try to change the map, an individXal may try to destroy the new reality.
Sadly,  sXch a   person may   e[pend   mXch more   energy  Xltimately  in
deIending an oXtmoded view oI the world than woXld have been reTXired to
revise and correct it in the Iirst place.

         Transference:      The   Outdated     Map


         This process oI active clinging to  an oXtmoded view oI reality is  the
basis Ior mXch mental illness. Psychiatrists reIer to it as transIerence. There
are probably as many sXbtle variations oI the deIinition  oI transIerence as
there are psychiatrists. My  own  deIinition  is:  TransIerence is that  set oI
ways oI  perceiving  and responding to  the  world  which  is  developed in
childhood  and  which  is   XsXally entirely   appropriate to   the  childhood
environment  (indeed,  oIten   liIe-saving)   bXt  which   is   inappropriately
transIerred into the adXlt environment.
         The  ways  in   which   transIerence maniIests  itselI,   while   always
pervasive and destrXctive, are oIten sXbtle. Yet the clearest e[amples mXst
be XnsXbtle. One sXch e[ample was a  patient whose treatment Iailed  by

33
virtXe oI  his  transIerence. He was a  brilliant  bXt  XnsXccessIXl compXter
technician in his early  thirties, who  came to see me becaXse his wiIe had
leIt him, taNing their two children. He was not particXlarly Xnhappy to lose
her, bXt he was devastated by the  loss oI  his children,  to  whom he  was
deeply attached. It  was  in  the hope  oI  regaining them  that  he initiated
psychotherapy, since his wiIe Iirmly  stated she woXld never retXrn to him
Xnless he had psychiatric treatment. Her  principal  complaints aboXt him
were that he was continXally and irrationally  MealoXs oI her, and yet at the
same  time    alooI    Irom    her,   cold,    distant,   XncommXnicative   and
XnaIIectionate.  She   also   complained   oI    his    IreTXent  changes   oI
employment.  His  liIe   since  adolescence had  been marNedly  Xnstable.
DXring adolescence he was involved in IreTXent minor altercations with the
police,  and  had been  Mailed three times  Ior   into[ication,   belligerence,
“loitering,”  and “interIering  with  the dXties oI an oIIicer.”  He dropped oXt
oI college,  where he was  stXdying electrical engineering, becaXse, as he
said, “My  teachers were a bXnch oI hypocrites, hardly  diIIerent  Irom  the
police.” BecaXse oI his brilliance and creativeness in the Iield oI compXter
technology, his services were in high demand by indXstry. BXt he had never
been able to  advance or  Neep a  Mob Ior more than  a  year and  a  halI,
occasionally  being  Iired,   more  oIten  TXitting   aIter  dispXtes  with   his
sXpervisors, whom he described as  “liars  and  cheats, interested only  in
protecting their  own  ass.” His  most IreTXent e[pression  was “YoX  can’t
trXst a goddamn soXl.”  He described his  childhood  as “normal”  and  his
parents as “average.” In the brieI period oI time he spent with me, however,
he  casXally  and  Xnemotionally  recoXnted  nXmeroXs instances  dXring
childhood in which his parents had let him down. They promised him a biNe
Ior his birthday, bXt they Iorgot aboXt it and gave him something else. Once
they Iorgot his birthday entirely, bXt he saw nothing drastically wrong with
this since “they were very bXsy.” They woXld promise to do things with him
on weeNends, bXt then were XsXally “too bXsy.” NXmeroXs times they Iorgot
to picN him  Xp Irom meetings or parties becaXse “they had a lot  on their
minds.”
         :hat   happened to this man was that when he was a yoXng child  he
sXIIered painIXl disappointment aIter  painIXl disappointment  throXgh his
parents’ lacN oI caring. GradXally  or sXddenly—I don’t  Nnow which—he
came to the agonizing realization in  mid-childhood that he coXld not trXst

34
his parents. Once he realized this, however, he began to Ieel better, and his
liIe  became more  comIortable. He  no  longer  e[pected  things  Irom  his
parents or got his hopes Xp when they  made promises. :hen   he stopped
trXsting his  parents  the IreTXency  and severity  oI   his  disappointments
diminished dramatically.
         SXch an adMXstment, however, is the basis Ior IXtXre problems. To a
child his or her parents are everything; they represent the world. The child
does not have the perspective to  see that other  parents are diIIerent and
IreTXently better. He assXmes that the way his parents do things is the way
that things are done. ConseTXently the realization—the “reality” —that this
child came to was not “I can’t  trXst my parents” bXt “I can’t trXst people. “
Not  trXsting  people thereIore  became the  map  with  which   he entered
adolescence and adXlthood. :ith  this  map and with  an abXndant store oI
resentment resXlting Irom his many disappointments, it was inevitable that
he came into conIlict aIter  conIlict with  aXthority IigXres—police, teacher,
employers. And  these conIlicts  only  served to  reinIorce his  Ieeling  that
people who had anything to give him  in the world  coXldn’t be trXsted. He
had many opportXnities to revise his map, bXt they were all passed Xp. For
one thing, the only way  he coXld learn that there were some people in the
adXlt world he coXld trXst woXld be to  risN trXsting them, and that woXld
reTXire a deviation Irom his map to begin with. For another, sXch relearning
woXld reTXire him to revise his view oI his parents—to realize that they did
not love him, that he did  not have a normal childhood and that his parents
were not average in their calloXsness to his needs. SXch a realization woXld
have been e[tremely painIXl. Finally,  becaXse his distrXst oI people was a
realistic adMXstment to the reality oI his childhood, it was an adMXstment that
worNed in terms oI diminishing his pain and sXIIering. Since it is e[tremely
diIIicXlt  to give Xp an adMXstment that once worNed so well, he continXed
his  coXrse oI  distrXst, XnconscioXsly creating  sitXations that  served  to
reinIorce it,  alienating  himselI  Irom  everyone, maNing it  impossible  Ior
himselI to enMoy love, warmth, intimacy and aIIection. He  coXld not even
allow himselI  closeness with his wiIe;  she, too, coXld not be  trXsted. The
only people he  coXld relate with  intimately  were  his two  children.  They
were the only ones over whom  he had control, the only  ones who had no
aXthority over him, the only ones he coXld trXst in the whole world.

         :hen    problems oI  transIerence are involved,   as they  XsXally are,
psychotherapy is, among other things, a process oI map-revising. Patients
come to therapy becaXse their maps are dearly not worNing. BXt how they
may cling to them and Iight  the process every step oI the way! FreTXently
their need to cling  to their  maps and Iight against losing  them is so great
that therapy  becomes impossible, as it  did  in  the  case oI  the compXter
technician. Initially    he  reTXested a  SatXrday appointment.  AIter  three
sessions he stopped coming becaXse he tooN a Mob doing lawn-maintenance
worN  on  SatXrdays and  SXndays. I   oIIered   him  a   ThXrsday-evening
appointment. He came Ior two  sessions and then stopped becaXse he was
doing overtime worN at the plant. I then rearranged my schedXle so I coXld
see him  on  Monday  evenings, when,  he had  said, overtime  worN  was
XnliNely. AIter  two  more sessions, however, he stopped coming becaXse
Monday-night overtime worN seemed to have picNed Xp. I conIronted him
with  the  impossibility   oI  doing  therapy Xnder  these circXmstances. He
admitted that  he was  not  reTXired to  accept overtime  worN. He  stated,
however, that he needed the money and that the worN was more important
to him  than  therapy. He  stipXlated that he  coXld see me  only  on those
Monday evenings when there was no overtime worN to be done and that he
woXld call me at IoXr o’clocN every Monday aIternoon to tell me iI he coXld
Neep his appointment that evening. I told him that these conditions were not
acceptable to me, that I was Xnwilling to set aside my plans every Monday
evening on the chance that he might be able to come to his sessions. He Ielt
that I was being Xnreasonably rigid, that I had no concern Ior his needs, that
I was interested only in my own time and dearly cared nothing Ior him, and
that thereIore I coXld not be trXsted. It was on this basis that oXr attempt to
worN together was terminated, with me as another landmarN on his old map.
         The  problem  oI   transIerence is   not  simply   a  problem  between
psychotherapists and their patients. It  is  a problem  between parents and
children, hXsbands and wives, employers and employees, between Iriends,
between groXps, and even between nations. It is interesting to specXlate, Ior
instance, on the role  that transIerence issXes play in international aIIairs.
OXr  national  leaders are  hXman  beings  who  all   had  childhoods  and
childhood e[periences that shaped them. :hat   map was  Hitler  Iollowing,
and where did it come Irom?  :hat   map were American  leaders Iollowing
in initiating,  e[ecXting and maintaining the war in Vietnam? Clearly it  was

36
a map very diIIerent  Irom that oI  the generation that sXcceeded theirs.. In
what ways did the national e[perience oI the Depression years contribXte to
their map, and the e[perience oI the IiIties and si[ties contribXte to the map
oI the  yoXnger generation? II  the national e[perience  oI  the thirties  and
Iorties contribXted to the  behavior oI  American leaders in waging  war in
Vietnam, how appropriate was that e[perience to the realities oI the si[ties
and seventies? How can we revise oXr maps more rapidly?
         TrXth or reality is avoided when it is painIXl. :e   can revise oXr maps
only  when we  have the discipline  to  overcome that  pain. To  have sXch
discipline, we mXst be totally dedicated to trXth. That is to say that we mXst
always hold trXth, as best we can determine it, to be more important, more
vital  to oXr  selI-interest, than oXr  comIort.  Conversely, we mXst always
consider oXr personal discomIort relatively Xnimportant and, indeed, even
welcome it   in  the service  oI  the  search Ior  trXth.  Mental  health is  an
ongoing process oI dedication to reality at all costs.

         Openness    to  Challenge


         :hat   does a liIe oI  total dedication to the trXth mean? It means, Iirst
oI all, a liIe  oI continXoXs and never-ending stringent selI-e[amination. :e
Nnow the world only throXgh oXr relationship to it. ThereIore, to Nnow the
world, we  mXst not only e[amine  it  bXt we mXst simXltaneoXsly e[amine
the e[aminer. Psychiatrists are taXght this in their training and Nnow that it
is impossible to  realistically Xnderstand the conIlicts and transIerences oI
their patients withoXt Xnderstanding their own transIerences and conIlicts.
For  this   reason  psychiatrists   are  encoXraged  to   receive  their   own
psychotherapy or psychoanalysis as part oI their training and development.
UnIortXnately, not all  psychiatrists respond to  this encoXragement. There
are many, psychiatrists among them, who stringently e[amine the world bXt
not so stringently e[amine themselves. They may be competent individXals
as the  world  MXdges competence, bXt they are never wise.  The  liIe  oI
wisdom mXst be a liIe oI contemplation combined with action. In the past in
American cXltXre, contemplation has not been held in  high regard. In  the
1950s people labeled Adlai Stevenson an “egghead” and believed he woXld
not maNe a good President precisely becaXse he was a contemplative man,

37
given to  deep  thinNing and  selI-doXbts. I  have  heard parents tell   their
adolescent children in  all   serioXsness, “YoX thinN too  mXch.” :hat     an
absXrdity this is, given the Iact  that it is  oXr Irontal lobes, oXr capacity to
thinN and to  e[amine  oXrselves that most maNes Xs hXman. FortXnately,
sXch attitXdes seem to be changing, and we are beginning to realize that the
soXrces oI danger to the world lie more within Xs than oXtside, and that the
process oI  constant selI-e[amination   and contemplation  is  essential Ior
Xltimate sXrvival. Still,  I am talNing oI  relatively small  nXmbers oI people
who are changing their attitXdes. E[amination oI the world withoXt is never
as personally painIXl as e[amination oI the world within,  and it is certainly
becaXse oI the pain involved in a liIe  oI genXine selI-e[amination that the
maMority steer away Irom it. Yet when one is dedicated to the trXth this pain
seems relatively Xnimportant—and less and less important (and thereIore
less and  less  painIXl)  the   Iarther  one  proceeds on  the  path  oI   selI-
e[amination.
         A liIe  oI total  dedication to the trXth also means a liIe oI willingness
to be personally challenged. The only way that  we can be certain that oXr
map oI reality is valid is to  e[pose it to the criticism  and challenge oI other
map-maNers. Otherwise we live in a closed system—within a bell Mar, to Xse
Sylvia Plath’s analogy, rebreathing only oXr own Ietid  air, more and more
sXbMect to delXsion. Yet, becaXse oI the pain inherent in  the  process oI
revising oXr  map  oI  reality,  we mostly  seeN to  avoid  or  ward  oII  any
challenges to its validity.  To oXr children we say, “Don’t  talN bacN to me,
I’m  yoXr parent.” To oXr spoXse we give the message, “Let’s live  and let
live. II  yoX criticize me, I’ll  be a bitch to live with,  and yoX’ll regret it.”  To
their Iamilies  and the world  the elderly  give  the message, “I am old  and
Iragile. II  yoX challenge me I may die  or at least yoX will  bear Xpon yoXr
head the responsibility Ior maNing my last days on earth miserable.” To oXr
employees we commXnicate, “II yoX are bold enoXgh to challenge me at all,
yoX had best do so very circXmspectly indeed or else yoX’ll  Iind  yoXrselI
looNing Ior another Mob.” *
         *Not   only   individuals   but  also  organizations  are   notorious  for
protecting themselves against challenge. I was once directed by the Chief
of Staff of the Army  to  prepare an analysis of the psychological causes of
the    My     Lai     atrocities    and    their     subsequent    cover-up,   with
recommendations for research that  might   prevent  such behavior in  the

38
future. The recommendations were disapproved by the Army general staff
on the basis that the research recommended could not be kept secret. “The
existence of such  research might  open us up  to  further  challenge. The
President and the Army   don’t need more challenges at  this time,”  I  was
told. Thus  an analysis of the reasons for an incident  that was covered up
was itself covered up. Such behavior is not  limited  to the  military  or  the
White  House; to  the  contrary, it   is common to  Congress, other  federal
agencies, corporations, even universities and charitable organizations—in
short, all  human organizations.  Just as it  is necessary for  individuals  to
accept and even welcome challenges to  their  maps  of reality   and modi
operandi if  they  are to  grow   in  wisdom and  effectiveness, so it is  also
necessary for organizations to accept and welcome challenges if they are to
be viable  and  progressive  institutions.  This   fact  is  being  increasingly
recognized by  such individuals  as John  Gardner of  Common  Cause, to
whom it  is clear that  one of  the most exciting  and essential tasks facing
our  society in   the  next  few  decades is to   build  into  the  bureaucratic
structure   of    our    organizations   an   institutionalized     openness  and
responsiveness to  challenge   which   will   replace  the   institutionalized
resistance currently typical.

         The tendency to avoid challenge is so omnipresent in hXman beings
that it  can properly  be considered a  characteristic oI  hXman natXre. BXt
calling it natXral does not mean it is essential or beneIicial or Xnchangeable
behavior. It  is also  natXral to deIecate in  oXr pants and never brXsh oXr
teeth. Yet  we  teach  oXrselves to  do  the  XnnatXral Xntil  the  XnnatXral
becomes itselI second natXre. Indeed, all selI-discipline might be deIined as
teaching oXrselves to do  the XnnatXral. Another characteristic  oI  hXman
natXre—perhaps the one that maNes Xs most hXman—is oXr capacity to do
the XnnatXral, to transcend and hence transIorm oXr own natXre.
         No  act is  more XnnatXral, and hence more hXman, than the act  oI
entering psychotherapy. For by this act we deliberately lay oXrselves open
to the deepest challenge Irom another hXman being, and even pay the other
Ior the service oI scrXtiny and discernment. This laying open to challenge is
one oI the things that lying on the coXch in the psychoanalyst’s oIIice may
symbolize. Entering psychotherapy is an act  oI the  greatest coXrage. The
primary reason people do not Xndergo psychotherapy is not that they lacN

39
the  money bXt  that  they   lacN the  coXrage. This  even  inclXdes  many
psychiatrists  themselves, who   somehow  never  TXite  seem to   Iind   it
convenient to enter their own therapy despite the Iact that  they have even
more reason than others to sXbmit themselves to the discipline involved. It
is  becaXse they  possess this  coXrage, on  the   other  hand,  that  many
psychoanalytic patients, even at the oXtset oI therapy and contrary to their
stereotypical image,  are  people  who  are  basically  mXch  stronger  and
healthier than average.
         :hile    Xndergoing psychotherapy is an Xltimate Iorm oI being open to
challenge,  oXr    more   ordinary   interactions    daily   oIIer    Xs   similar
opportXnities to risN openness: at the water cooler, in  conIerence, on the
golI coXrse, at the dinner  table, in  bed when the  lights are oXt; with  oXr
colleagXes, oXr sXpervisors and employees, with oXr mates, oXr Iriends, oXr
lovers, with  oXr parents and oXr children. A neatly coiIIXred  woman who
had been seeing me Ior some time began to comb her hair each time she got
Xp Irom the coXch at the end oI a session. I commented on this new pattern
to her behavior. “Several  weeNs ago my hXsband noticed that my  hairdo
was Ilattened in the  bacN aIter I retXrned Irom a  session,” she e[plained,
blXshing. “I didn’t tell  him why. I’m  aIraid he might tease me iI he Nnows I
lie on the coXch in here.” So we had another issXe to worN on. The greatest
valXe oI   psychotherapy  derives  Irom   the  e[tension  oI   the  discipline
involved dXring the “IiIty-minXte   hoXr” into  the patient’s daily aIIairs  and
relationships. The  healing  oI   the  spirit   has not   been completed  Xntil
openness to challenge becomes a way oI liIe.  This  woman woXld not  be
wholly  well  Xntil she coXld be as Iorthright  with  her hXsband as she was
with me.
         OI all  those who come to a psychiatrist or  psychotherapist very Iew
are initially  looNing on a conscioXs level Ior  challenge or an edXcation in
discipline. Most  are simply  seeNing “relieI.”   :hen   they  realize they  are
going to  be  challenged as well  as  sXpported, many Ilee  and others are
tempted to Ilee. Teaching them that the only real relieI  will  come throXgh
challenge  and  discipline   is  a   delicate,  oIten   lengthy  and  IreTXently
XnsXccessIXl tasN. :e     speaN, thereIore,  oI   “sedXcing”   patients  into
psychotherapy. And we  may say  oI  some patients whom  we have  been
seeing Ior a year or more, “They have not really entered therapy yet.”

40
         Openness in psychotherapy is particXlarly encoXraged (or demanded,
depending Xpon yoXr point oI view) by the techniTXe oI “Iree association.”
:hen   this  techniTXe is Xsed the patient is told: “PXt into  words whatever
comes  into   yoXr   mind,   no   matter  how   seemingly   insigniIicant    or
embarrassing or painIXl or meaningless. II there is more than one thing in
yoXr mind at the same time, then yoX are to choose to speaN that thing aboXt
which  yoX  are  most  relXctant  to   speaN.” It’s   easier said  than  done.
Nonetheless, those who  worN  at  it  conscientioXsly XsXally  maNe swiIt
progress. BXt some are so resistant to challenge that they simply pretend to
Iree-associate. They talN volXbly enoXgh aboXt this or that, bXt they leave
oXt the crXcial details. A woman may  speaN Ior an hoXr aboXt Xnpleasant
childhood  e[periences  bXt  neglect  to   mention  that   her  hXsband had
conIronted her in  the morning with  the  Iact that she had overdrawn their
banN accoXnt by a thoXsand dollars. SXch patients attempt to transIorm the
psychotherapeXtic hoXr into a Nind oI  press conIerence. At best they are
wasting  time  in  their   eIIort  to  avoid   challenge, and  XsXally  they  are
indXlging in a sXbtle Iorm oI lying.
         For  individXals  and  organizations to  be  open  to  challenge,  it  is
necessary that their maps oI  reality  be  truly  open Ior  inspection  by  the
pXblic. More than press conIerences are reTXired. The third thing that a liIe
oI total dedication to the trXth means, thereIore, is a liIe oI total honesty. It
means a continXoXs and never-ending process oI selI-monitoring to assXre
that oXr commXnications—not only the words that we say bXr also the way
we say them—invariably reIlect as accXrately as hXmanly possible the trXth
or reality as we Nnow it.
         SXch honesty does not come painlessly. The reason people lie is to
avoid the pain oI  challenge and its conseTXences. President Ni[on’s lying
aboXt :atergate was no more sophisticated or diIIerent in Nind Irom that oI
a IoXr-year-old who lies to his or her mother aboXt how the lamp happened
to Iall oII  the table and get broNen. InsoIar as the natXre oI the challenge is
legitimate (and it  XsXally is), lying  is an attempt to  circXmvent legitimate
sXIIering and hence is prodXctive oI mental illness.
         The  concept oI   circXmvention  raises the  issXe oI   “shortcXtting.”
:henever   we attempt to circXmvent an obstacle, we are looNing Ior a path
to oXr goal which will be easier and thereIore TXicNer: a shortcXt. Believing
that the growth  oI  the hXman spirit is  the end oI  hXman e[istence, I  am

41
obvioXsly dedicated to the notion oI progress. It is right and proper that as
hXman beings we shoXld grow  and progress as rapidly  as possible. It  is
thereIore right and proper that we shoXld avail oXrselves oI any legitimate
shortcXt to  personal  growth.  The  Ney  word,  however,  is  “legitimate.”
HXman beings have almost  as mXch oI  a  tendency to  ignore legitimate
shortcXts as they do to  search oXt illegitimate  ones. It is,  Ior  instance, a
legitimate shortcXt to  stXdy a synopsis oI  a  booN instead oI reading  the
original booN in its entirety in  preparation Ior an e[amination Ior  a degree.
II  the synopsis is a  good one, and the material  is absorbed, the essential
Nnowledge can be obtained in a manner that saves considerable time and
eIIort. Cheating,  however, is not  a legitimate  shortcXt. It  may save even
greater amoXnts oI time and, iI sXccessIXlly e[ecXted, may gain the cheater
a passing marN on  the e[am   and the  coveted degree. BXt  the essential
Nnowledge has  not  been  obtained.  ThereIore  the   degree is   a  lie,   a
misrepresentation. InsoIar  as the  degree becomes a  basis  Ior  liIe,   the
cheater’s liIe becomes a lie and misrepresentation and is oIten devoted to
protecting and preserving the lie.
         GenXine psychotherapy is a legitimate  shortcXt to  personal growth
which  is  oIten  ignored.  One  oI  the  most  IreTXent rationalizations  Ior
ignoring  it   is  to   TXestion its   legitimacy  by   saying,  “I’m    aIraid  that
psychotherapy woXld get to be a crXtch. I don’t want to become dependent
on a crXtch.” BXt this is XsXally a cover-Xp Ior more signiIicant Iears. The
Xse oI psychotherapy is no more a crXtch than the Xse oI hammer and nails
to bXild a hoXse. It is possible to bXild a hoXse withoXt hammer and nails,
bXt the process is generally not eIIicient or  desirable. Few carpenters will
despair oI their dependency on hammer and nails. Similarly, it is possible to
achieve personal growth withoXt  employing psychotherapy, bXt oIten the
tasN is Xnnecessarily tedioXs, lengthy and diIIicXlt. It generally maNes sense
to Xtilize available tools as a shortcXt.
         On the other  hand, psychotherapy may be soXght as an illegitimate
shortcXt. This most commonly  occXrs in certain cases oI parents seeNing
psychotherapy Ior their  children.  They  want  their children  to  change in
some way: stop Xsing drXgs, stop having temper tantrXms, stop getting bad
grades, and so on. Some parents have e[haXsted their own resoXrceIXlness
in  trying  to  help their  children  and come  to the  psychotherapist with  a
genXine willingness to worN on the problem. Others as oIten as not come

42
with the overt Nnowledge oI the caXse oI their child’s problem, hoping that
the psychiatrist will  be able to  do some magical something to change the
child withoXt having to change the basic caXse oI the problem. For instance,
some parents will  openly say, “:e    Nnow that we  have a problem  in oXr
marriage, and that this liNely has something to do with oXr son’s problem.
Nonetheless, we do not want oXr marriage tampered with; we do not want
yoX to  do therapy  with  Xs; we  want  yoX MXst to worN with  oXr son, iI
possible, to help  him be  happier.” Others are less open. They  will  come
proIessing a willingness  to  do  anything that’s  necessary, bXt when it  is
e[plained  to  them that  their  child’s  symptoms are  an e[pression  oI  his
resentment toward their whole liIe style, which leaves no real room Ior his
nXrtXre, they will say, “It is ridicXloXs to thinN that we shoXld tXrn oXrselves
inside oXt Ior  him,”  and they will   depart to looN Ior  another psychiatrist,
one who might oIIer  them a painless .shortcXt. Farther down the piNe they
will  liNely  tell  their  Iriends  and themselves, “:e     have done everything
possible Ior oXr boy; we have even gone to IoXr separate psychiatrists with
him, bXt nothing has helped.”
         :e    lie,  oI  coXrse, not  only  to   others bXt  also to  oXrselves. The
challenges to oXr adMXstment—oXr maps—Irom oXr own consciences and
oXr own realistic perceptions may be every bit as legitimate and painIXl as
any challenge Irom  the  pXblic. OI  the myriad  lies  that people  oIten tell
themselves, two oI the most common, potent and destrXctive are “:e really
love oXr children”  and “OXr  parents really loved Xs.” It  may:  be that oXr
parents did love Xs and we do love oXr children bXt when it is not the case,
people  oIten  go  to   e[traordinary   lengths  to   avoid  the   realization.  I
IreTXently reIer  to  psychotherapy as  the “trXth   game” or  the  “honesty
game” becaXse its bXsiness is among other things to help patients conIront
sXch lies: One oI the  roots oI  mental illness is  invariably  an interlocNing
system oI lies  we have been told  and lies we  have told oXrselves. These
roots can be Xncovered and e[cised only in an atmosphere oI Xtter honesty.
To create this  atmosphere it  is  essential Ior  therapists to  bring  to  their
relationships with  patients a total  capacity Ior  openness and trXthIXlness.
How can  a patient be e[pected  to  endXre the pain oI  conIronting reality
Xnless we bear the same pain? :e can lead only insoIar as we go beIore.

43
         Withholding       Truth


         Lying can be divided into two types: white lies and blacN lies. *
         *  The  C.I.A., which  has particular  expertise in  this  area, naturally
uses a more elaborate system of classification and will speak of white, gray
and black propaganda, gray propaganda being a single black lie and black
propaganda a black lie falsely attributed to another source.

         A blacN lie is a statement we maNe that we Nnow is Ialse. A white lie
is a  statement we maNe that  is not  in  itselI  Ialse  bXt that  leaves oXt a
signiIicant part  oI the trXth.  The Iact that  a lie is  white  does not in itselI
maNe it any less oI a lie or any more e[cXsable. :hite lies may be every bit
as destrXctive  as  blacN  ones. A   government  that  withholds   essential
inIormation Irom  its people by censorship is no more democratic than one
that speaNs Ialsely. The patient  who  neglected to  mention  that she had
overdrawn the Iamily banN accoXnt was impeding her growth in therapy no
less than  iI   she  had  lied  directly.   Indeed, becaXse it   may  seem less
reprehensible, the withholding oI essential inIormation is the most common
Iorm  oI  lying,  and  becaXse it may  be  the more  diIIicXlt  to  detect  and
conIront, it is oIten even more pernicioXs than blacN-lying.
         :hite-lying      is   considered socially   acceptable  in   many   oI   oXr
relationships becaXse “we don’t  want to  hXrt peoples’  Ieelings.”  Yet we
may bemoan the Iact that oXr social relationships are generally sXperIicial.
For parents to Ieed their children a pap oI white lies is not only considered
acceptable bXt is thoXght to be loving and beneIicent. Even hXsbands and
wives who  have been brave  enoXgh to be  open with  each other  Iind  it
diIIicXlt oIten to be open with their children.
         They do not tell their children that they smoNe mariMXana, or that they
IoXght with each other the night beIore concerning their relationship, or that
they resent the grandparents Ior their manipXlativeness, or that the doctor
has told one or both that they have psychosomatic disorders, or that they are
maNing a risNy Iinancial investment or even how mXch money they have in
the banN. UsXally sXch withholding and lacN oI openness is rationalized on
the basis  oI  a  loving   desire to  protect  and  shield  their  children  Irom
Xnnecessary worries.  Yet   more  oIten   than  not   sXch  “protection”   is

44
XnsXccessIXl. The children Nnow anyway that Mommy and Daddy smoNe
pot,  that  they  had a  Iight   the  night  beIore,  that  the  grandparents are
resented, that Mommy  is nervoXs and  that Daddy  is losing  money. The
resXlt, then, is not protection bXt deprivation. The children are deprived oI
the Nnowledge they might gain aboXt money, illness, drXgs, se[, marriage,
their  parents, their  grandparents and  people in   general. They  are  also
deprived  oI  the  reassXrance they  might   receive  iI   these topics  were
discXssed more openly.  Finally,   they  are  deprived  oI   role  models  oI
openness and honesty, and are provided instead with role models oI partial
honesty, incomplete openness and limited coXrage. For some parents the
desire to “protect”  their children is motivated  by genXine albeit misgXided
love. For  others,  however, the  “loving”   desire  to  protect their  children
serves more as a cover-Xp and rationalization  oI a  desire to avoid  being
challenged by their children,  and a desire to maintain their  aXthority over
them. SXch parents are saying  in  eIIect,  “LooN,  Nids, yoX go  on  being
children with  childish concerns and leave the adXlt concerns Xp to Xs. See
Xs as strong and loving caretaNers. SXch an image is good Ior both oI Xs, so
don’t challenge it. It allows Xs to Ieel strong and yoX to Ieel saIe, and it will
be easier Ior all oI Xs iI we don’t looN into these things too deeply.”
         Nonetheless, a  real  conIlict  may  arise  when  the  desire Ior   total
honesty is  opposed by  the  needs oI  some  people Ior   certain Ninds oI
protection.  For   instance, even  parents  with   e[cellent   marriages  may
occasionally consider divorce as one oI their possible options, bXt to inIorm
their children  oI  this at a  time when  they are not  at all  liNely to  opt  Ior
divorce is to  place an Xnnecessary bXrden Xpon the children. The idea oI
divorce is e[tremely  threatening to a child’s  sense oI secXrity—indeed, so
threatening that children do not have the capacity to perceive it with mXch
perspective. They are serioXsly threatened by the possibility oI divorce even
when it is remote. II their  parents’ marriage is deIinitely on the rocNs, then
children will  be dealing with the threatening possibility oI  divorce whether
or not  their parents talN aboXt it.  BXt iI  the  marriage is basically  soXnd,
parents woXld indeed be doing their children a disservice iI they said with
complete openness, “Mommy  and  Daddy  were talNing  last  night  aboXt
getting a  divorce, bXt we’re  not  at all  serioXs aboXt it  at this  time.”  As
another instance, it is IreTXently necessary Ior psychotherapists to withhold
their own thoXghts, opinions and insights Irom patients in the earlier stages

45
oI psychotherapy becaXse the patients are not yet ready to receive or deal
with  them. DXring  my  Iirst  year oI  psychiatric  training  a patient  on his
IoXrth visit  to me  recoXnted a dream that obvioXsly e[pressed a concern
with homose[Xality.  In my  desire to appear to be a brilliant   therapist and
maNe rapid  progress I   told  him,   “YoXr  dream  indicates  that  yoX are
concerned with worries  that yoX might  be homose[Xal.” He  grew visibly
an[ioXs, and he did not Neep his ne[t three appointments. Only with a good
deal oI worN and an even greater amoXnt oI lXcN was I able to persXade him
to retXrn to therapy. :e  had another twenty sessions beIore he had to move
Irom the area becaXse oI a bXsiness reassignment. These sessions were oI
considerable beneIit to him despite the Iact that we never again raised the
issXe oI homose[Xality. The Iact that his XnconscioXs was concerned with
the issXe did not mean that he was at all ready to deal with it on a conscioXs
level, and  by  not  withholding  my  insight  Irom   him  I  did  him  a  grave
disservice, almost losing him not only as my patient bXt as anyone’s patient.
         The selective withholding  oI  one’s opinions  mXst also be practiced
Irom  time  to  time  in  the world   oI  bXsiness or politics  iI   one is  to  be
welcomed into the coXncils oI power. II  people were always to speaN their
minds  on   issXes  both  great   and  small,   they   woXld   be  considered
insXbordinate by the average sXpervisor, and a threat to an organization by
management. They woXld gain repXtation Ior  abrasiveness and woXld be
deemed too  XntrXstworthy ever  to  be  appointed  as spoNesmen Ior  an
organization. There is simply no way aroXnd the Iact that iI one is to  be at
all eIIective  within   an organization, he or  she mXst partially  become an
“organization person,” circXmspect in the e[pression oI individXal opinions,
merging at times  personal identity  with  that  oI the  organization. On  the
other hand, iI one regards one’s eIIectiveness in an organization as the only
goal oI  organizational behavior,  permitting  only  the e[pression  oI  those
opinions that  woXld  not maNe waves, then  one has allowed  the  end to
MXstiIy the means, and will  have lost  personal integrity   and identity  by
becoming the total  organization person. The  road that  a great  e[ecXtive
mXst travel between the preservation and the loss oI his or her identity and
integrity is  e[traordinarily  narrow, and very, very Iew  really maNe the trip
sXccessIXlly. It is an enormoXs challenge.
         So the e[pression  oI  opinions, Ieelings,  ideas and even Nnowledge
mXst  be  sXppressed Irom   time   to   time   in    these  and  many   other

46
circXmstances in the coXrse oI hXman aIIairs.  :hat    rXles, then, can one
Iollow iI  one is dedicated to the trXth? First, never speaN Ialsehood. Second,
bear in mind that the act oI withholding the trXth is always potentially a lie,
and that in each instance in which the trXth is withheld a signiIicant  moral
decision is reTXired. Third, the decision to withhold the trXth shoXld never
be based on personal needs, sXch as a need Ior power, a need to be liNed or
a need to protect  one’s map Irom  challenge. FoXrth, and conversely, the
decision to withhold the trXth mXst always be based entirely Xpon the needs
oI the person or people Irom  whom the trXth is  being withheld.  FiIth, the
assessment oI another’s  needs is  an  act  oI  responsibility  which   is  so
comple[  that  it   can only   be e[ecXted  wisely  when  one  operates with
genXine love Ior the other. Si[th, the primary Iactor in the assessment oI an.
other’s needs is the assessment oI that person’s capacity to Xtilize the trXth
Ior his  or  her own  spiritXal growth.  Finally,  in  assessing the capacity oI
another to Xtilize the trXth Ior personal spiritXal growth, it shoXld be borne
in  mind   that  oXr  tendency  is  generally  to   Xnderestimate rather  than
overestimate this capacity.
         All  this  might  seem liNe an  e[traordinary  tasN, impossible to  ever
perIectly complete, a chronic and never-ending bXrden, a real drag. And it
is indeed  a  never-ending bXrden oI  selI-discipline,  which   is  why  most
people opt Ior  a  liIe  oI  very  limited  honesty  and openness and relative
closedness, hiding themselves and their maps Irom the world.  It  is easier
that way. Yet the rewards oI the diIIicXlt  liIe  oI  honesty and dedication to
the trXth are more than commensXrate with the demands. By virtXe oI the
Iact that  their  maps  are continXally  being  challenged, open  people are
continXally growing people. ThroXgh their openness they can establish and
maintain  intimate  relationships  Iar  more  eIIectively   than  more  closed
people. BecaXse they never speaN Ialsely they can be secXre and proXd in
the Nnowledge that they have done nothing to contribXte to the conIXsion oI
the world,  bXt  have served as soXrces oI  illXmination  and  clariIication.
Finally, they are totally  Iree to  be. They are not bXrdened by any need to
hide. They do not have to slinN aroXnd in the shadows. They do not have to
constrXct new lies to  hide old  ones. They need waste no  eIIort  covering
tracNs or maintaining disgXises. And Xltimately  they Iind  that the  energy
reTXired Ior  the  selI-discipline   oI  honesty  is  Iar  less  than the  energy
reTXired Ior  secretiveness. The more  honest one  is,  the easier  it  is  to

47
continXe being honest, MXst as the more lies one has told, the more necessary
it is to lie again. By  their openness, people dedicated to the trXth live in the
open, and throXgh the e[ercise oI  their  coXrage to live  in the  open, they
become Iree Irom Iear.

         Balancing


         By this time I  hope it is becoming clear that the e[ercise oI discipline
is not only a demanding bXt also a comple[ tasN, reTXiring both Ile[ibility
and MXdgment. CoXrageoXs people mXst continXally pXsh themselves to be
completely honest, yet mXst also possess the capacity to withhold the whole
trXth  when   appropriate.  To   be  Iree   people  we   mXst   assXme total
responsibility Ior  oXrselves, bXt in doing  so mXst possess the capacity to
reMect responsibility that is not trXly oXrs. To be organized and eIIicient, to
live wisely, we mXst daily delay gratiIication and Neep an eye on the IXtXre;
yet to  live   MoyoXsly we mXst also possess the capacity, when  it  is  not
destrXctive, to live  in  the present and act spontaneoXsly. In other words,
discipline  itselI  mXst be  disciplined.  The type  oI  discipline  reTXired to
discipline discipline  is what I  call balancing, and it  is the IoXrth  and Iinal
type that I woXld liNe to discXss here.
         Balancing  is  the discipline  that  gives  Xs Ile[ibility.    E[traordinary
Ile[ibility   is reTXired Ior sXccessIXl living in all spheres oI activity. To Xse
bXt one e[ample,  let Xs consider the  matter oI  anger and its  e[pression.
Anger is  an emotion  bred into  Xs (and  into  less evolved  organisms) by
coXntless generations oI  evolXtion  in   order  that  oXr  sXrvival  may  be
encoXraged. :e e[perience  anger whenever we perceive another organism
attempting to encroach Xpon oXr geographical or psychological territory or
trying,  one way  or  another, to  pXt  Xs down.  It  leads Xs to  Iight   bacN.
:ithoXt   oXr  anger we woXld  indeed be continXally  stepped on, Xntil we
were totally sTXashed and e[terminated. Only with  anger can we sXrvive.
Yet, more oIten than not, when we initially perceive others as attempting to
encroach on Xs, we realize Xpon closer e[amination  that that is  not what
they intend to do  at all. Or  even when we determine that people are trXly
intending to encroach on Xs, we may realize that, Ior one reason or another,
it is not in  oXr best interests to respond to that imposition with anger. ThXs

48
It IS  necessary that the higher centers oI oXr brain (MXdgment) be able to
regXlate and modXlate the lower centers (emotion). To IXnction sXccessIXlly
in oXr comple[ world  it is necessary Ior Xs to possess the capacity not only
to e[press oXr anger bXt also not to e[press it. Moreover, we mXst possess
the capacity to e[press oXr anger in diIIerent ways. At times, Ior instance, it
is necessary to e[press it only aIter mXch deliberation and selI-evalXation.
At  other times  it  is  more  to  oXr beneIit  to  e[press it   immediately  and
spontaneoXsly. Sometimes it is best to e[press it coldly and calmly; at other
times loXdly and hotly.  :e    thereIore not only  need to Nnow how to  deal
with  oXr anger  in  diIIerent  ways  at diIIerent   times bXt  also how  most
appropriately to match the right time with  the right  style oI e[pression. To
handle oXr anger with IXll adeTXacy and competence, an elaborate, Ile[ible
response system is reTXired. It is no wonder, then, that to learn to  handle
oXr anger is  a comple[   tasN which XsXally cannot  be completed beIore
adXlthood, or even mid-liIe, and which oIten is never completed.
         To a greater or lesser degree, all people sXIIer Irom inadeTXacies oI
their  Ile[ible    response systems. MXch  oI   the  worN  oI   psychotherapy
consists oI attempting  to help  oXr patients allow  or  maNe their response
systems become more Ile[ible.   Generally, the more  crippled  by an[iety,
gXilt and insecXrity oXr patients are, the more diIIicXlt and rXdimentary this
worN  IS.   For   e[ample,   I   worNed  with    a  brave   thirty-two-year-old
schizophrenic woman to whom  it  was a veritable  revelation to learn  that
there are some men she shoXld not let in her Irom door,’ some she shoXld
let into her  living  room bXt not her bedroom, and some she coXld let into
her bedroom. PrevioXsly she had operated with a response system by which
she either had to let everyone into her bedroom or, when this response did
not seem to be worNing, not let anyone in her Iront door. ThXs she boXnced
between degrading promiscXity and arid isolation. :ith  the same woman it
was necessary Ior Xs to spend several sessions IocXsing on the matter oI
thanN-yoX notes. She Ielt compelled  to  send a lengthy,  elaborate, hand-
written, phrase-and word-perIect letter in response to each and every giIt or
invitation  she received. Inevitably she coXld not  continXally carry  sXch a
bXrden, with the resXlt that she woXld either write no notes at all or woXld
reMect all giIts and invitations. Again, she was astoXnded to learn that there
were some giIts that did not  reTXire thanN-yoX notes, and that when these
were reTXired, short notes sometimes sXIIiced.

49
         MatXre mental  health demands, then, an  e[traordinary  capacity  to
Ile[ibly    striNe   and  continXally   restriNe  a   delicate  balance   between
conIlicting  needs, goals, dXties, responsibilities, directions, et cetera. The
essence oI this discipline oI balancing is “giving Xp.” I remember Iirst being
taXght this one sXmmer morning in my ninth year. I had recently learned to
ride a biNe and was  MoyoXsly e[ploring the dimensions oI  my new  sNill.
AboXt a mile  Irom oXr hoXse the road went down a  steep hill and tXrned
sharply at the bottom. Coasting down the hill on my biNe that morning I Ielt
my gathering speed to be ecstatic. To give Xp this ecstasy by the application
oI   braNes  seemed  an    absXrd  selI-pXnishment.   So   I    resolved  to
simXltaneoXsly retain my speed and negotiate the corner at the bottom. My
ecstasy ended seconds later when I was propelled a dozen Ieet oII the road
into the woods. I was badly scratched and bleeding and the Iront wheel oI
my new biNe was twisted beyond Xse Irom its impact against a tree. I had
lost my balance.
         Balancing  is   a   discipline   precisely  becaXse the   act  oI   giving
something Xp is painIXl. In this instance I had been Xnwilling to  sXIIer the
pain oI  giving   Xp my  ecstatic  speed in  the interest  oI  maintaining  my
balance aroXnd the corner. I learned, however, that the loss oI  balance is
Xltimately more painIXl than the giving Xp reTXired to maintain balance. In
one way   or  another  it  is  a  lesson  I   have continXally   had to   relearn
throXghoXt my liIe. As  mXst everyone, Ior as we negotiate the cXrves and
corners oI oXr lives, we  mXst continXally give  Xp parts oI oXrselves. The
only alternative to this giving Xp is not to travel at all on the MoXrney oI liIe.
         It may seem strange, bXt most people choose this alternative and elect
not to continXe with their liIe MoXrneys—to stop short by some distance—in
order to avoid  the pain oI  giving  Xp parts oI  themselves. II it  does seem
strange, it is becaXse yoX do not Xnderstand the depth oI the pain that may
be involved.  In its  maMor Iorms, giving Xp is  the most painIXl  oI hXman
e[periences. ThXs Iar I have been talNing aboXt minor Iorms oI giving Xp—
giving Xp speed or the lX[Xry oI spontaneoXs anger or the saIety oI withheld
anger or the neatness oI a thanN-yoX note. Let me tXrn now to the giving Xp
oI personality traits,  well-established patterns oI behavior, ideologies, and
even whole liIe styles. These are maMor Iorms oI giving Xp that are reTXired
iI one is to travel very Iar on the MoXrney oI liIe.

50
         One night  recently  I  decided to  spend some  Iree time  bXilding  a
happier and closer  relationship with   my  IoXrteen-year-old daXghter. For
several weeNs she had been Xrging me to play chess with her, so I sXggested
a game. She eagerly accepted and we  settled down  to a  most even and
challenging match. It was a school night, however, and at nine o’clocN my
daXghter asNed iI I coXld hXrry my  moves, becaXse she needed to get to
bed; she had to  get  Xp at si[   in  the morning.  I  Nnew her  to be  rigidly
disciplined in her sleeping habits, and it seemed to me that she oXght to be
able to give Xp some oI this  rigidity:  I  told her, “Come on,  yoX can go to
bed a little later  Ior once. YoX shoXldn’t start games that yoX can’t Iinish.
:e’re   having IXn.” :e   played on Ior  another IiIteen minXtes, dXring which
time she became visibly discomIited. Finally  she pleaded, “Please, Daddy,
please hXrry yoXr moves.”
         “No goddammit,”  I replied. “Chess is a serioXs game. II yoX’re going
to play it  well,  yoX’re going to play  it slowly.  II  yoX don’t want to  play it
serioXsly, yoX might as well  not play  it  at all.”   And so, with  her  Ieeling
miserable, we   continXed Ior   another  ten  minXtes,  Xntil  sXddenly  my
daXghter bXrst into tears, yelled that she conceded the stXpid game, and ran
weeping Xp the stairs.
         Immediately I Ielt  as iI I  were nine years old again, lying bleeding in
the bXshes by the side oI the road, ne[t to  my biNe. Clearly I  had made a
mistaNe. Clearly I had Iailed to negotiate a tXrn in the road. I had started the
evening wanting to have a  happy time with  my  daXghter. Ninety minXtes
later she was in tears and so angry at me she coXld hardly speaN. :hat had
gone wrong? The answer was obvioXs. BXt I did not want to see the answer,
so it tooN me two hoXrs to wade throXgh the pain oI accepting the Iact that I
had botched  the evening  by  allowing  my   desire to  win  a  chess game
become more important  than my  desire to  bXild  a relationship  with  my
daXghter. I was  depressed in earnest then. How  had  I  gotten so  oXt oI
balance? GradXally it dawned on me that my  desire to win  was too great
and that I needed to give Xp some oI this desire. Yet even this little giving
Xp seemed impossible. All my liIe my desire to win had served me in good
stead, Ior I had won many things. How was it possible to play chess withoXt
wanting   to    win?    I     had   never    been   comIortable   doing    things
XnenthXsiastically. How coXld I conceivably play chess enthXsiastically bXt
not  serioXsly?  Yet  somehow  I   had  to  change,  Ior   I   Nnew that   my

51
enthXsiasm, my competitiveness and my serioXsness were part oI a behavior
pattern that was worNing and woXld continXe to worN toward alienating my
children Irom  me, and that iI I  were not able to  modiIy  this pattern, there
woXld be other times  oI Xnnecessary tears and bitterness. My depression
continXed.
         My depression is over now. I have given Xp part oI my desire to win
at games. That part oI me is gone now. It  died. It  had to die.  I Nilled it.  I
Nilled it with my desire to win at parenting. :hen  I  was a child my desire to
win at games served me well.  As a parent, I  recognized that it got  in my
way. So it had to go. The times have changed. To move with them I had to
give it Xp. I do not miss it. I thoXght I woXld, bXt I don’t.

         The  Healthiness      of  Depression


         The Ioregoing  is  a  minor  e[ample  oI  what  those people with  the
coXrage to call themselves patients mXst go throXgh in more maMor ways,
and oIten  many  times, in  the  process oI  psychotherapy. The  period  oI
intensive psychotherapy is a period oI intensive growth,  dXring which  the
patient may  Xndergo more  changes than  some people  e[perience  in  a
liIetime. For this  growth spXrt to occXr, a proportionate amoXnt oI “the old
selI” mXst be given Xp. It is an inevitable pan oI sXccessIXl psychotherapy.
In Iact, this  process oI giving Xp XsXally begins beIore the patient has his
Iirst appointment with the psychotherapist. FreTXently, Ior instance, the act
oI deciding to  seeN psychiatric attention in itselI represents a giving Xp oI
the selI-image “I’m  OK.”   This giving  Xp may be particXlarly  diIIicXlt  Ior
males in  oXr cXltXre  Ior  whom  “I’m   not  OK  and  I  need assistance to
Xnderstand why I’m  not OK  and  how to  become OK”  is  IreTXently and
sadly eTXated with “I’m weaN, XnmascXline and inadeTXate.” ActXally, the
giving-Xp process oIten begins even beIore the  patient has arrived at  the
decision to seeN psychiatric attention. I mentioned that• dXring the process
oI giving  Xp my desire [o always win I  was depressed. This is becaXse the
Ieeling associated with giving  Xp something loved—or at  least something
that is  a  part  oI  oXrselves and Iamiliar—is   depression. Since  mentally
healthy hXman beings mXst grow, and since giving Xp or loss oI the old selI
is an integral part oI the process oI mental and spiritXal growth, depression

52
is a  normal and  basically healthy  phenomenon. It becomes abnormal or
Xnhealthy only when something interIeres with the giving-Xp process, with
the resXlt  that  the depression is  prolonged  and  cannot be  resolved by
completion oI the process. *
         *  There  are  many  factors  that  can  interfere  with   the  giving-up
process and, therefore, prolong a normal, healthy depression into a chronic
pathologic depression. 2f all the possible factors, one of the most common
and potent is a pattern of experiences in childhood wherein parents or fate,
unresponsive to the needs of the child, took  away “things”  from the  child
before he or  she was  psychologically ready  to  give  them up  or  strong
enough to truly accept their loss. Such a pattern of experience in childhood
sensitizes the child  to  the experience of  loss and creates a tendency far
stronger than that  found in more fortunate individuals  to cling to  “things”
and seek to avoid the pain of loss or  giving  up. For this  reason, although
all pathologic depressions involve some blockage in the giving-up process,
I  believe there  is a  type  of chronic  neurotic  depression that  has  as its
central root a traumatic  injury  to the individual’s  basic capacity to give up
anything,  and  to  this  subtype  of  depression I   would  apply  the  name
“giving-up neurosis.”

         A  leading   reason Ior   people to   thinN  aboXt seeNing psychiatric
attention is  depression. In   other words,  patients  are IreTXently  already
involved   in    a    giving-Xp,   or    growth,   process   beIore   considering
psychotherapy, and it is  the symptoms oI  this growth  process that impel
them toward the therapist’s oIIice. The therapist’s Mob, thereIore, is to help
the patient complete a growth process that he or she has already begXn. This
is not to say that patients are oIten aware oI what is happening to them. To
the contrary, they IreTXently desire only relieI Irom  the symptoms oI their
depression “so that things can be as they Xsed to be.” They do not Nnow that
things can no longer  be “the  way they  Xsed to be.” BXt  the XnconscioXs
Nnows. It is  precisely becaXse the XnconscioXs in its wisdom Nnows that
“the way  things Xsed to be”  is no  longer tenable or  constrXctive that the
process oI growing  and giving  Xp is begXn on  an XnconscioXs level and
depression is e[perienced. As liNely as not the patient will  report,  “I  have
no idea why  I’m   depressed” or will   ascribe the  depression to irrelevant
Iactors. Since patients are not yet conscioXsly willing or ready to recognize

53
that the “old selI’ and “the way things Xsed to be” are oXtdated, they are not
aware that their depression is signaling  that maMor change is reTXired Ior
sXccessIXl and evolXtionary adaptation. The Iact that the XnconscioXs is one
step ahead oI the conscioXs may seem strange to lay readers; it is, however,
a Iact that applies not only in this speciIic instance bXt so generally that it is
a basic principal oI mental IXnctioning. It will  be discXssed in greater depth
in the conclXding section oI this worN.
         Recently we have been hearing oI the “mid-liIe crisis.”  ActXally, this
is bXt one oI  many “crises,”  or  critical  stages oI development, in liIe,  as
EriN EriNson taXght Xs thirty years ago.  (EriNson delineated eight crises;
perhaps there are more.) :hat   maNes crises oI these transition periods in
the liIe   cycle—that  is, problematic  and  painIXl—is  that  in  sXccessIXlly
worNing oXr way throXgh them we mXst give Xp cherished notions and old
ways oI doing  and looNing at things. Many people are either Xnwilling  or
Xnable to sXIIer the  pain oI  giving   Xp the oXtgrown  which  needs to be
IorsaNen. ConseTXently they cling, oIten Iorever, to  their  old  patterns oI
thinNing and behaving, thXs Iailing to negotiate any crisis, to trXly grow Xp,
and  to  e[perience   the  MoyIXl sense oI   rebirth   that  accompanies  the
sXccessIXl transition into greater matXrity. AlthoXgh an entire booN coXld be
written  aboXt each  one,  let  me  simply  list,   roXghly  in  order  oI  their
occXrrence, some oI the maMor conditions, desires and attitXdes that mXst be
given Xp in the coXrse oI a wholly sXccessIXl evolving liIetime:

         The state oI inIancy, in which no e[ternal demands need be responded
to
         The Iantasy oI omnipotence

         Renunciation       and  Rebirth


         In  regard to  the last  oI  the  above, it  may  seem to many  that the
Xltimate reTXirement—to give Xp one’s  selI and  one’s liIe—represents a
Nind oI crXelty on the part oI God or Iate, which maNes oXr e[istence a sort
oI bad MoNe and which can never be completely accepted. This attitXde is
particXlarly trXe in  present-day :estern  cXltXre, in  which the  selI is held
sacred and death is considered an XnspeaNable insXlt. Yet the e[act opposite
is the reality. It  is in  the giving  Xp oI selI  that hXman beings can Iind the
most ecstatic and lasting,  solid, dXrable Moy oI liIe.  And  it  is  death that
provides liIe  with  all its  meaning. This  “secret” is  the central wisdom  oI
religion.
         The process oI giving Xp the selI (which is related to the phenomenon
oI love, as will  be discXssed in the ne[t section oI this booN) is Ior most oI
Xs a gradXal process which we get into by a series oI  Iits and starts. One
Iorm oI  temporary giving  Xp oI the selI deserves special mention becaXse
its  practice  is  an  absolXte reTXirement Ior   signiIicant  learning  dXring
adXlthood, and thereIore Ior signiIicant  growth  oI the  hXman spirit. I  am
reIerring  to   a  sXbtype  oI   the   discipline   oI  balancing   which   I   call
“bracNeting.” BracNeting is  essentially the act  oI  balancing the need Ior
stability  and assertion oI  the selI  with  the need Ior  new  Nnowledge and
greater Xnderstanding by temporarily giving  Xp one’s selI—pXtting  one’s
selI aside, so to. speaN—so as to maNe room Ior the incorporation oI new
material into   the  selI.  This  discipline  has  been well   described by  the
theologian Sam Keen in To a Dancing God:
                The  second step reTXires that I go beyond the idiosyncratic and
       egocentric perception oI  immediate e[perience.  MatXre awareness is
       possible only when I have digested and compensated Ior the biases and
       preMXdices that are the residXe oI my personal history. Awareness oI
       what  presents itselI to me involves  a doXble movement oI  attention:
       Silencing   the  Iamiliar   and  welcoming   the  strange.  Each  time   I
       approach a strange obMect, person, or event, I have a tendency to let my

55
       present needs, past e[perience, or e[pectations Ior the IXtXre determine
       what I  will   see. II I  am to appreciate the XniTXeness oI any datXm, I
       mXst be sXIIiciently aware oI my preconceived ideas and characteristic
       emotional   distortions  to   bracNet them  long   enoXgh  to  welcome
       strangeness and novelty into my  perceptXal world. This discipline  oI
       bracNeting, recompensating, or silencing  reTXires sophisticated selI-
       Nnowledge and coXrageoXs honesty. Yet, withoXt this discipline each
       present moment is  only  the repetition  oI  something already seen or
       e[perienced.  In order  Ior  genXine novelty to emerge, Ior  the XniTXe
       presence oI  things,  persons, or  events to  taNe root  in  me,  I  mXst
       Xndergo a decentralization oI the ego.*
         * New York: Harper  & Row, 1970, p. 28.

         The discipline oI bracNeting illXstrates the most conseTXential Iact oI
giving Xp and oI discipline  in general: namely that Ior  all  that is given Xp
even more is gained. SelI-discipline is a selI-enlarging process. The pain oI
giving Xp is the .pain oI death, bXt death oI the old is birth oI the new. The
pain oI death is the pain oI birth, and the pain oI birth  is the pain oI death.
For Xs to develop a new and better idea, concept, theory or Xnderstanding
means that an old idea, concept, theory or Xnderstanding mXst die. ThXs, in
the conclXsion oI his poem “JoXrney oI the Magi,” T. S. Eliot describes the
Three :ise   Men  as sXIIering the giving  Xp oI  their  previoXs world view
when they embraced Christianity.

         All this Zas a long time ago, I remember,
         And I Zould do it again, but set doZn
         This set doZn
         This: Zere Ze led all that Zay for
         Birth or Death? This Zas a Birth, certainly,
         We had eYidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,
         But had thought they Zere different; this Birth Zas
         Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.
         We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,
         But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,
         With an alien people clutching their gods.
         I should be glad of another death. *

Brace, 1952), p. 69.

         Since birth and death seem to be bXt diIIerent sides oI the same coin,
it is really  not at all Xnreasonable to pay closer heed than we XsXally do in
the :est  to the concept oI reincarnation. BXt whether or not we are willing
to entertain  serioXsly the possibility   oI  some Nind oI   rebirth occXrring•
simXltaneoXsly with  oXr physical  death, it  is  abXndantly clear  that  this
liIetime  is  a  series oI  simXltaneoXs deaths and births. “ThroXghoXt  the
whole oI liIe one mXst continXe to learn to live,” said Seneca two millennia
ago, “and what will amaze yoX even more, throXghoXt liIe one mXst learn to
die.”†
         †  Quoted in  Erich Fromm,  The Sane Society (New York: Rinehart,
1955).

         It is  also clear that the Iarther one travels on the MoXrney oI liIe, the
more births one will  e[perience, and thereIore the more deaths—the more
Moy and the more pain.
         This raises the TXestion oI whether it is ever possible to become Iree
Irom emotional pain in this liIe.  Or,’ pXtting it more mildly,  is it possible to
spiritXally evolve to a level  oI conscioXsness at which the pain oI living is
at least diminished? The answer is yes and no. The answer is yes, becaXse;
once sXIIering is completely accepted, it ceases in a sense to be sXIIering. It
is also yes becaXse the Xnceasing practice oI discipline leads to mastery, and
the spiritXally involved person is masterIXl in the same sense that the adXlt
IS masterIXl III relation to the child. Matters that present great problems Ior
the child and caXse it great pain may be oI no conseTXence to the adXlt at
all. Finally, the answer is yes becaXse the spiritXally evolved individXal is,
as will    be  elaborated  in.  the   ne[t   section,  an  e[traordinarily   loving
individXal, and with his or her e[traordinary love comes e[traordinary Moy.
         The answer is no, however, becaXse there is a vacXXm oI competence
in the world  which mXst be Iilled.  In a world  crying oXt in desperate need
Ior  competence, an e[traordinarily   competent and loving  person can  no
more withhold his or her competence than sXch a person coXld deny Iood to
a hXngry inIant.  SpiritXally  evolved people, by  virtXe oI  their  discipline,
mastery and love,  are people  oI  e[traordinary  competence, and in  their

57
competence they are called on to  serve the world,  and in their  love  they
answer the  call.  They  are inevitably,  thereIore,  people oI   great power,
althoXgh the world  may generally behold  them as TXite ordinary  people,
since more oIten than not they  will  e[ercise their  power III  TXiet or even
hidden ways. Nonetheless, e[ercise power they do, and in this e[ercise they
sXIIer greatly, even dreadIXlly. For to e[ercise power is to maNe decisions,
and the process oI maNing decisions with total awareness is oIten inIinitely
more painIXl  than  maNing decisions with   limited  or  blXnted  awareness
(which is  the way  most decisions are made and why  they  are Xltimately
proved wrong). Imagine two generals, each having to decide whether or not
to commit a division  oI  ten thoXsand men to battle. To one the division is
bXt a thing, a Xnit oI personnel, an instrXment oI strategy and nothing more.
To the other it is these things, bXt he is also aware oI each and every one oI
the ten  thoXsand lives and  the lives  oI  the  Iamilies  oI  each oI  the  ten
thoXsand. For whom is the decision easier? It is easier Ior the general who
has blXnted his awareness precisely becaXse he cannot tolerate the pain oI a
more nearly complete  awareness. It may be tempting  to  say, “Ah,  bXt a
spiritXally evolved man woXld  never become a general in the Iirst place.”
BXt the same issXe is involved in being a corporation president, a physician,
a teacher, a parent. Decisions aIIecting the lives oI others mXst always be
made. The best decision-maNers are those who are willing to sXIIer the most
over their decisions bXt still retain their ability to be decisive. One measXre
—and perhaps the best measXre—oI a person’s greatness is the capacity Ior
sXIIering. Yet the great are also MoyIXl. This, then, is the parado[. BXddhists
tend to  ignore the BXddha’s sXIIering  and Christians Iorget  Christ’s  Moy.
BXddha and Christ were not diIIerent men. The sXIIering oI  Christ letting
go on the cross and the Moy oI BXddha letting go Xnder the bo tree are one.
         So iI  yoXr  goal is  to avoid  pain and escape sXIIering, I  woXld not
advise yoX to  seeN higher levels oI  conscioXsness or spiritXal evolXtion.
First, yoX cannot achieve them withoXt sXIIering, and second, insoIar as yoX
do achieve them,  yoX are liNely  to  be called  on to  serve in  ways more
painIXl to yoX, or  at least demanding oI  yoX, than yoX can now imagine.
Then why  desire to evolve at  all, yoX  may asN. II yoX asN this TXestion,
perhaps yoX do not Nnow enoXgh oI Moy. Perhaps yoX may Iind an answer in
the remainder oI this booN; perhaps yoX will not.

58
         A Iinal  word on  the discipline oI balancing and its essence oI giving
Xp: yoX mXst have something in order to  give  it Xp. YoX cannot give  Xp
anything yoX have not already gotten. II yoX give Xp winning withoXt ever
having won, yoX are where yoX were at  the beginning: a loser. YoX mXst
Iorge Ior yoXrselI an identity  beIore yoX can give it Xp. YoX mXst develop
an ego beIore yoX can lose it. This may seem incredibly elementary, bXt I
thinN it  is necessary to say it,  since  there are many people I  Nnow who
possess a vision oI evolXtion yet seem to lacN the will Ior it. They want, and
believe it is possible, to sNip over the discipline, to Iind an easy short-cXt to
sainthood.  OIten  they   attempt  to   attain   it   by   simply   imitating   the
sXperIicialities oI saints, retiring to the desert or taNing Xp carpentry. Some
even believe that  by  sXch imitation  they have  really  become saints and
prophets, and are Xnable to acNnowledge that they are still children and Iace
the painIXl Iact  that they  mXst start at the beginning  and go throXgh the
middle.
         Discipline  has been deIined  as a  system oI  techniTXes oI  dealing
constrXctively with the  pain oI  problem-solving—instead oI avoiding  that
pain—in sXch a way that  all oI  liIe’s  problems can be solved. FoXr basic
techniTXes have been distingXished and elaborated: delaying gratiIication,
assXmption oI   responsibility,   dedication  to   the  trXth   or  reality,   and
balancing. Discipline  is a system oI  techniTXes, becaXse these techniTXes
are very mXch interrelated. In a single act one may Xtilize two, three or even
all oI  the techniTXes at the same time and in sXch a way that they may be
distingXishable Irom each other. The strength, energy and willingness to Xse
these techniTXes are provided by love,  as will  be  elaborated in the  ne[t
section. This analysis oI discipline has not been intended to be e[haXstive,
and it   is  possible that  I   have neglected  one or  more  additional  basic
techniTXes, althoXgh I sXspect not. It is also reasonable to asN whether sXch
processes as bioIeedbacN, meditation, yoga, and psychotherapy itselI are
not techniTXes oI discipline, bXt to  this I  woXld reply  that, to my  way oI
thinNing, they are technical aids rather than basic techniTXes. As sXch they
may be  very  XseIXl bXt are not  essential. On  the other  hand, the basic
techniTXes herein described, iI  practiced Xnceasingly and genXinely, are
alone sXIIicient to  enable the  practitioner oI  discipline,  or  “disciple,”   to
evolve to spiritXally higher levels.

     LoYe   Defined


         Discipline,  it  has been sXggested, is the means oI  hXman spiritXal
evolXtion.  This section will e[amine  what lies in bacN oI discipline—what
provides the motive, the energy Ior  discipline.   This Iorce  I believe  to be
love.  I am very conscioXs oI the Iact that in attempting to e[amine love we
will  be beginning  to  toy with  mystery.   In  a very  real  sense we will  be
attempting to  e[amine  the Xne[aminable  and to  Nnow the  XnNnowable. 
Love is  too  large, too  deep ever to  be trXly  Xnderstood or measXred or
limited within  the IrameworN oI words.  I  woXld not write  this iI  I  did not
believe the attempt to have valXe, bXt no matter how valXable, I begin with
the certain Nnowledge that the attempt will be in some ways inadeTXate.
         One resXlt oI the mysterioXs natXre oI love is that no one has ever, to
my Nnowledge, arrived at a trXly satisIactory deIinition oI love. In an eIIort
to e[plain  it, thereIore, love has been divided into varioXs categories: eros,
philia, agape, perIect love, and imperIect love, and so on.  I am presXming,
however, to give a single deIinition oI love, again with the awareness that it
is liNely to be in some way or ways inadeTXate.  I deIine love thXs: The will
to e[tend  one’s selI  Ior  the pXrpose oI nXrtXring one’s own  or  another’s
spiritXal growth.
         At the oXtset I woXld liNe to comment brieIly on this deIinition beIore
proceeding to a more thoroXgh elaboration.  First, it may be noticed that it
is a teleological deIinition;  the behavior is  deIined in terms oI  the goal or
pXrpose it seems to serve—in this case, spiritXal growth. Scientists tend to
hold teleological deIinitions  sXspect, and perhaps they will this one. I  did
not arrive at it, however, throXgh a clearly teleological process oI thinNing.
Instead I   arrived  at  it  throXgh  observation  in  my  clinical   practice  oI
psychiatry (which inclXdes selI-observation), in which the deIinition oI love
is a matter oI  considerable import.  This is  becaXse patients are generally
very conIXsed as to the natXre oI  love. For  instance, a timid  yoXng man
reported to me: “My mother loved me so mXch she woXldn’t let me taNe the

61
school bXs to school Xntil my senior year in high school. Even then I had to
beg her to let me  go. I gXess she was aIraid that I woXld  get hXrt, so she
drove me to and Irom  school every day, which was very hard on her. She
really  loved  me.”  In  the  treatment  oI  this  individXal’s  timidity    it  was
necessary, as it is in many other cases, to teach him that his mother might
have been motivated by something other than love, and that what seems to
be love is  oIten not love  at all.  It  has been oXt oI sXch e[perience that I
accXmXlated a body oI e[amples  oI what  seemed to be acts oI  love and
what seemed not  to  be  love.  One oI   the maMor distingXishing IeatXres
between the two seemed to be the conscioXs or XnconscioXs pXrpose in the
mind oI the lover or nonlover.
         Second, it may be noticed that, as deIined, love is a strangely circXlar
process. For the process oI e[tending one’s selI is an evolXtionary process.
:hen   one has sXccessIXlly e[tended one’s limits, one has then grown into a
larger state oI being. ThXs the act oI loving is an act oI selI-evolXtion even
when the pXrpose oI the act is someone else’s growth. It is throXgh reaching
toward evolXtion that we evolve.
         Third, this  Xnitary deIinition  oI love inclXdes selI-love with  love  Ior
the other. Since I am hXman and yoX are hXman, to love hXmans means to
love myselI as well as yoX. To be dedicated to hXman spiritXal development
is to  be dedicated to the  race oI which  we  are a part, and  this thereIore
means dedication to oXr own development as well  as “theirs.”  Indeed, as
has been pointed oXt, we are incapable oI  loving  another Xnless we love
oXrselves, MXst as we are incapable oI teaching oXr children selI-discipline
Xnless we oXrselves are selI-disciplined. It is actXally impossible to IorsaNe
oXr own  spiritXal  development in   Iavor  oI  someone else’s. :e    cannot
IorsaNe selI-discipline and at the same time be disciplined in  oXr care Ior
another. :e   cannot  be a  soXrce oI strength  Xnless we nXrtXre oXr own
strength. As we proceed in oXr e[ploration oI the natXre oI love, I believe it
will  become clear that not only do selI-love  and love oI others go hand in
hand bXt that Xltimately they are indistingXishable.
         FoXrth, the act oI e[tending  one’s limits  implies eIIort.  One e[tends
one’s limits only  by e[ceeding  them, and e[ceeding limits  reTXires eIIort.
:hen    we  love  someone oXr  love  becomes demonstrable or   real  only
throXgh oXr e[ertion throXgh the Iact that Ior that someone (or Ior oXrselI)

62
we taNe an e[tra step or walN an e[tra mile.  Love is  not eIIortless. To the
contrary, love is eIIortIXl.
         Finally, by  Xse oI the word “will”    I have attempted to transcend the
distinction between desire and action. Desire  is not necessarily translated
into action.  :ill     is  desire oI sXIIicient  intensity  that it  is  translated into
action. The diIIerence between the two is  eTXal to the diIIerence between
saying “I  woXld liNe  to go  swimming tonight”   and “I  will   go swimming
tonight.”  Everyone in oXr cXltXre desires to some e[tent to  be loving, yet
many are not in Iact  loving. I  thereIore conclXde that the desire to love is
not itselI love. Love is as love does. Love is an act oI will—namely, both an
intention and an action. :ill     also implies choice. :e   do  not have to love.
:e   choose to love. No matter how mXch we may thinN we are loving, iI we
are in Iact not loving, it is becaXse we have chosen not to love and thereIore
do not love despite oXr good intentions. On the other hand, whenever we do
actXally e[ert  oXrselves in the caXse oI spiritXal growth, it  is  becaXse we
have chosen to do so. The choice to love has been made.
         As I  indicated,  patients who come  to psychotherapy are invariably
IoXnd to be more or less conIXsed aboXt the natXre oI love. This is becaXse
in the Iace oI  the mystery oI  love misconceptions aboXt it aboXnd. :hile
this booN will   not  remove Irom  love  its  mystery,  I  hope it  will   clariIy
matters sXIIiciently  to  help  do  away  with  these misconceptions, which
caXse sXIIering not only to patients bXt to all people as they attempt to maNe
sense oXt oI their  own e[periences. Some oI  this  sXIIering seems to me
Xnnecessary, since these popXlar  misconceptions  coXld  be  made  less
popXlar throXgh the teaching oI a more  precise deIinition oI  love.  I have
thereIore chosen to begin e[ploring  the natXre oI love by e[amining  what
love is not.

         Falling     in  “LoYe”


         OI all the misconceptions aboXt love the most powerIXl and pervasive
is the belieI that “Ialling in love”  is love or at least one oI the maniIestations
oI love. It  is a potent misconception, becaXse Ialling in love is sXbMectively
e[perienced in a very  powerIXl Iashion as an e[perience  oI love.  :hen   a
person Ialls in love what he or she certainly Ieels is “I love him”  or “I  love

63
her.” BXt  two  problems  are immediately  apparent. The  Iirst  is  that  the
e[perience oI Ialling  in  love is  speciIically a se[-linNed  erotic e[perience.
:e   do not  Iall  in  love with  oXr children  even thoXgh we may love  them
very deeply. :e  do not Iall in  love with oXr Iriends oI the same se[—Xnless
we are homose[Xally oriented—even thoXgh we may care Ior them greatly.
:e   Iall  in  love  only when  we are conscioXsly or  XnconscioXsly se[Xally
motivated. The second problem is’ that the e[perience oI Ialling  in  love is
invariably temporary. No matter whom  we Iall  in  love with,  we sooner or
later Iall oXt oI love iI the relationship continXes long enoXgh. This is not to
say that we invariably cease loving the person with whom  we Iell  in love.
BXt it is to  say that the Ieeling oI ecstatic lovingness that characterizes the
e[perience oI Ialling  in  love always passes. The honeymoon always ends.
The bloom oI romance always Iades.
         To Xnderstand the natXre oI the phenomenon oI Ialling in love and the
inevitability  oI  its  ending, it  is  necessary to e[amine the  natXre oI what
psychiatrists call ego boXndaries. From what we can ascertain by indirect
evidence, it appears that the newborn inIant dXring the Iirst Iew months oI
its liIe   does not distingXish  between itselI  and the  rest oI  the  Xniverse.
:hen   it  moves its arms and legs, the world is moving. :hen    it is  hXngry,
the world is hXngry. :hen   it  sees its mother move, it is as iI  it is moving.
:hen   its mother sings, the baby does not Nnow that it is itselI  not maNing
the soXnd. It   cannot distingXish  itselI  Irom  the  crib,  the  room  and  its
parents. The animate and the inanimate are the same. There is no distinction
yet between I and thoX. It and the world are one. There are no boXndaries,
no separations. There is no identity.
         BXt with e[perience the child  begins to e[perience itselI—namely, as
an entity separate Irom  the rest oI  the world.  :hen    it  is hXngry, mother
doesn’t always appear to Ieed it. :hen  it  is playIXl, mother doesn’t always
want to play. The child  then has the e[perience oI its  wishes not being its
mother’s command. Its will  is  e[perienced as something separate Irom its
mother’s behavior. A sense oI the “me” begins to develop. This interaction
between the inIant and the mother is believed to be the groXnd oXt oI which
the child’s sense oI identity begins to grow. It has been observed that when
the interaction between the inIant and its mother is  grossly distXrbed—Ior
e[ample, when there is no mother, no satisIactory mother sXbstitXte or when
becaXse oI  her  own  mental  illness  the  mother  is   totally  Xncaring  or

64
Xninterested—then the inIant grows into  a child  or  adXlt whose sense oI
identity is grossly deIective in the most basic ways.
         As the  inIant  recognizes its will   to be  its own  and not  that oI  the
Xniverse, it begins to maNe other distinctions between itselI and the world.
:hen   it wills  movement, its arm waves beIore its eyes, bXt neither the crib
nor the ceiling  move.  ThXs the child  learns that  its arm  and its  will  are
connected, and thereIore that its arm is its and not something or  someone
else’s.  In   this  manner,  dXring   the  Iirst   year   oI   liIe,   we   learn  the
IXndamentals oI who we are and who we are not, what we are and what we
are not. By the end oI oXr Iirst year we Nnow that this is my arm, my Ioot,
my  head, my  tongXe, my  eyes and even  my  viewpoint,  my  voice,  my
thoXghts, my stomachache, and my Ieelings.  :e   Nnow oXr  size and oXr
physical limits.  These limits  are oXr boXndaries. The Nnowledge oI these
limits inside oXr minds is what is meant by ego boXndaries.
         The  development oI   ego  boXndaries is  a  process that  continXes
throXgh childhood  into   adolescence and even  into  adXlt-hood, bXt  the
boXndaries established later are more psychic than physical. For instance,
the age between two and three is typically a time when the child comes to
terms with  the limits   oI  its power.  :hile    beIore this  time  the child  has
learned that its wish is not necessarily its mother’s command, it still clings
to the  possibility  that  its  wish might  be  its  mother’s command  and the
Ieeling that its wish shoXld be her command. It is becaXse oI this hope and
Ieeling  that  the two-year-old  XsXally  attempts to  act  liNe  a tyrant  and
aXtocrat, trying to give orders to its  parents, siblings and Iamily  pets as iI
they were menials in  its  own private  army, and responds with  regal IXry
when they  won’t  be dictated  to. ThXs parents speaN oI this  age as “the
terrible  twos.”  By  the  age oI  three the  child  has XsXally become more
tractable and mellow as a resXlt oI an acceptance oI the reality oI its  own
relative powerlessness. Still, the possibility oI omnipotence is sXch a sweet,
sweet dream that it cannot be completely given Xp even aIter several years
oI very painIXl conIrontation with one’s own impotence. AlthoXgh the child
oI three has come to accept the reality oI the boXndaries oI its power, it will
continXe to escape occasionally Ior  some years to come  into a  world  oI
Iantasy in which  the possibility oI  omnipotence (particXlarly its  own) still
e[ists. This  is the  world  oI SXperman and Captain Marvel. Yet  gradXally
even the sXperheroes are given Xp, and by the  time oI  mid-adolescence,

65
yoXng people Nnow that they are individXals, conIined to the boXndaries oI
their Ilesh  and the  limits  oI  their  power, each one a  relatively  Irail  and
impotent organism, e[isting  only by  cooperation within  a groXp oI Iellow
organisms called  society.  :ithin      this  groXp  they  are  not  particXlarly
distingXished, yet   they   are  isolated  Irom   others  by   their   individXal
identities, boXndaries and limits.
         It is lonely  behind these boXndaries. Some people—particXlarly those
whom  psychiatrists  call  schizoid—becaXse oI  Xnpleasant, traXmatizing
e[periences in  childhood,  perceive  the  world  oXtside oI   themselves as
Xnredeemably dangeroXs, hostile, conIXsing and XnnXrtXring. SXch people
Ieel their  boXndaries to be protecting and comIorting  and Iind  a sense oI
saIety in their  loneliness. BXt most oI Xs Ieel oXr loneliness to be  painIXl
and yearn to escape Irom behind the walls oI oXr individXal identities to  a
condition  in  which  we  can be  more XniIied  with   the world   oXtside oI
oXrselves. The  e[perience  oI  Ialling   in   love  allows   Xs this   escape—
temporarily. The essence oI the phenomenon oI Ialling in love is a sXdden
collapse oI a section oI  an individXal’s  ego boXndaries, permitting one to
merge his or her identity with that oI another person. The sXdden release oI
oneselI Irom oneselI, the e[plosive poXring oXt oI oneselI into the beloved,
and the dramatic, sXrcease oI loneliness accompanying this collapse oI ego
boXndaries is e[perienced by most oI Xs as ecstatic. :e and oXr beloved are
one! Loneliness is no more! In  some respects (bXt certainly not in all) the
act oI Ialling in love is an act oI regression. The e[perience oI merging with
the loved one has in it echoes Irom the time when we were merged with oXr
mothers in inIancy. Along with  the merging we also ree[perience the sense
oI omnipotence which we had to  give Xp in oXr MoXrney oXt oI childhood.
All  things seem possible! United with oXr beloved we Ieel we can conTXer
all obstacles. :e  believe that the strength oI oXr love will   caXse the Iorces
oI opposition to bow down in  sXbmission and melt away into the darNness.
All problems will  be overcome. The IXtXre will be all light. The Xnreality oI
these Ieelings when we have Iallen  in  love is  essentially the same as the
Xnreality oI the two-year-old  who Ieels itselI  to be Ning oI the Iamily  and
the world with power Xnlimited.
         JXst  as   reality    intrXdes   Xpon  the   two-year-old’s    Iantasy   oI
omnipotence so does reality intrXde Xpon the Iantastic Xnity oI the coXple
who have Iallen  in  love. Sooner or  later, in  response to the problems oI

66
daily  living,  individXal   will   reasserts itselI. He  wants to  have  se[;  she
doesn’t. She wants to go to the movies; he doesn’t. He wants to pXt money
in the banN; she wants a dishwasher. She wants to talN aboXt her Mob; he
wants to talN aboXt his. She doesn’t liNe his Iriends• he doesn’t liNe hers. So
both oI them, in the privacy oI  their hearts, begin to come to the sicNening
realization that they are not one with the beloved, that the beloved has and
will  continXe to have his or her own  desires, tastes, preMXdices and timing
diIIerent  Irom  the other’s.  One  by  one, gradXally  or  sXddenly, the ego
boXndaries snap bacN into place; gradXally or  sXddenly, they Iall  oXt oI
love. Once again they are two separate individXals. At this point they begin
either to dissolve the ties oI their relationship or to initiate the worN oI real
loving.
         By my  Xse oI the word “real”  I am implying  that the perception that
we are loving when we Iall in love is a Ialse perception—that oXr sXbMective
sense oI lovingness is  an  illXsion.  FXll  elaboration oI  real  love will   be
deIerred Xntil later  in this  section. However;  by stating that  it  is when  a
coXple Ialls oXt oI love  they may begin to  really love  I am  also implying
that real love does not have its roots in  a Ieeling oI  love. To the contrary,
real love oIten occXrs in a conte[t  in  which the Ieeling  oI love  is lacNing,
when we act lovingly  despite the Iact that we don’t Ieel  loving. AssXming
the reality oI the deIinition oI love  with which we started, the e[perience oI
“Ialling  in love” is not real love Ior the several reasons that Iollow.
         Falling in  love is not  an act oI will.  It  is not  a conscioXs choice. No
matter how open to or eager Ior it we may be, the e[perience may still elXde
Xs. Contrarily,  the  e[perience   may  captXre Xs  at  times  when  we  are
deIinitely not seeNing it, when it is inconvenient and Xndesirable. :e are as
liNely to Iall in love with  someone with whom we are obvioXsly ill matched
as with someone more sXitable. Indeed, we may not even liNe or admire the
obMect oI oXr passion, yet, try as we might, we may not be able to  Iall in
love  with  a  person  whom  we  deeply  respect and  with  whom  a  deep
relationship woXld  be in  all  ways  desirable. This  is  not to  say that  the
e[perience oI  Ialling   in  love  is  immXne to  discipline.  Psychiatrists, Ior
instance, IreTXently Iall in love with their patients, MXst as their patients Iall
in love  with  them, yet  oXt oI  dXty to  the patient  and their  role they  are
XsXally able to abort the collapse oI their  ego boXndaries and give Xp the
patient as a romantic  obMect. The strXggle and sXIIering oI the discipline

67
involved may  be enormoXs. BXt discipline  and will  can  only control  the
e[perience; they  cannot create it.  :e   can  choose how to  respond to the
e[perience oI Ialling in love, bXt we cannot choose the e[perience itselI.
         Falling in love is not an e[tension oI one’s limits or boXndaries; it is a
partial  and temporary  collapse  oI  them.  The  e[tension  oI  one’s  limits
reTXires eIIort;   Ialling   in   love   is   eIIortless.  Lazy   and  Xndisciplined
individXals are as liNely  to  Iall  in  love  as energetic and dedicated ones.
Once the precioXs moment oI Ialling in love has passed and the boXndaries
have snapped bacN into place, the individXal may be disillXsioned,  bXt is
XsXally none the larger Ior  the  e[perience. :hen    limits   are e[tended or
stretched, however, they tend to stay stretched. Real love is a permanently
selI-enlarging e[perience. Falling in love is not.
         Falling  in   love  has little   to  do  with   pXrposively nXrtXring  one’s
spiritXal development. II we have any pXrpose in mind when we Iall in love
it is to  terminate oXr own loneliness and perhaps insXre this resXlt throXgh
marriage. Certainly we  are not thinNing oI  spiritXal development. Indeed,
aIter we have Iallen in love and beIore we have Iallen oXt oI love again we
Ieel that we have arrived, that the heights have been attained, that there is
both no need and no possibility oI going higher. :e  do not Ieel oXrselves to
be in any need oI development; we are totally content to be where we are.
OXr spirit is at peace. Nor do we perceive oXr beloved as being in need oI
spiritXal development. To the contrary, we perceive him or her as perIect, as
having been perIected. II  we  see any IaXlts in  oXr beloved, we  perceive
them as insigniIicant—little   TXirNs or darling eccentricities that  only  add
color and charm.
         II Ialling  in love is not love, then what is it other than a temporary and
partial collapse oI ego boXndaries? I do not Nnow. BXt the se[Xal speciIicity
oI the phenomenon leads me to sXspect that it is a genetically determined
instinctXal component oI mating. behavior. In  other words,  the temporary
collapse oI ego boXndaries that constitXtes Ialling in  love is  a stereotypic
response oI hXman beings to a conIigXration oI internal se[Xal drives and
e[ternal se[Xal  stimXli, which  serves to increase the probability oI  se[Xal
pairing and bonding so as to enhance the sXrvival oI the species. Or to pXt it
in another, rather crass way, Ialling in love is a tricN that oXr genes pXll on
oXr otherwise  perceptive  mind  to  hoodwinN  or  trap  Xs into   marriage.
FreTXently the tricN goes awry  one way  or  another, as when the  se[Xal

68
drives  and   stimXli   are  homose[Xal   or   when  other   Iorces—parental
interIerence, mental  illness,  conIlicting   responsibilities  or   matXre selI-
discipline sXpervene to prevent the bonding. On the other hand, withoXt this
tricN, this illXsory and inevitably temporary (it  woXld not be practical were
it not temporary) regression to inIantile merging and omnipotence, many oI
Xs who are happily  or  Xnhappily married  today woXld  have retreated in
whole-hearted terror Irom the realism oI the marriage vows.

         The  Myth    of  Romantic     LoYe


         To  serve as  eIIectively   as it   does to  trap  Xs  into  marriage,  the
e[perience oI Ialling in love probably mXst have as one oI its characteristics
the illXsion that the e[perience will  last Iorever. This illXsion is  Iostered in
oXr cXltXre by the commonly  held  myth oI  romantic  love, which  has its
origins  in   oXr Iavorite   childhood  Iairy   tales,  wherein  the  prince   and
princess, once Xnited, live happily Iorever aIter. The myth oI romantic love
tells Xs, in eIIect, that Ior  every yoXng man in  the world  there is a yoXng
woman who  was “meant  Ior  him,”   and vice  versa. Moreover, the  myth
implies that there is only one man meant Ior a woman and only one woman
Ior a man and this has been predetermined “in the stars.” :hen we meet the
person Ior whom we are intended, recognition comes throXgh the Iact that
we Iall in  love. :e   have met the person Ior whom all the heavens intended
Xs, and since the match is perIect, we will then be able to satisIy all oI each
other’s needs Iorever and ever, and thereIore live happily  Iorever aIter  in
perIect Xnion and harmony. ShoXld it come to pass, however, that we do not
satisIy or meet all oI  each other’s needs and Iriction arises and we Iall oXt
oI love, then it  is clear that  a dreadIXl mistaNe was made, we misread the
stars, we did not  hooN Xp with oXr one and only  perIect match, what we
thoXght was love was not real or “trXe” love, and nothing can be done aboXt
the sitXation e[cept  to live  Xnhappily ever aIter  or get  divorced. :hile     I
generally Iind  that great myths are great precisely becaXse they represent
and embody great Xniversal trXths (and  will   e[plore  several sXch myths
later in this booN), the myth oI romantic love is a dreadIXl lie. Perhaps it is a
necessary lie   in   that  it   ensXres the   sXrvival  oI   the   species by   its
encoXragement and seeming validation oI  the  Ialling-in-love   e[perience

69
that traps Xs into marriage. BXt as a psychiatrist I weep in my heart almost
daily Ior the ghastly conIXsion and sXIIering that this myth Iosters. Millions
oI people waste vast amoXnts oI energy desperately and IXtilely attempting
to maNe the reality oI their lives conIorm to the Xnreality oI the myth. Mrs.
A. sXbMXgates herselI absXrdly to her hXsband oXt oI a Ieeling oI gXilt. “I
didn’t really  love my  hXsband when we married,” she says. “I pretended I
did. I gXess I tricNed him into it, so I have no right  to complain aboXt him,
and I owe it  to’ him  to do whatever he wants.” Mr.  B. laments: “I  regret I
didn’t  marry Miss  C. I  thinN we  coXld have had a  good marriage. BXt I
didn’t Ieel  head over heels in love with  her, so I assXmed she coXldn’t be
the right person Ior me.” Mrs. D.,  married Ior two years, becomes severely
depressed withoXt apparent caXse, and enters therapy stating: “I don’t Nnow
what’s wrong.  I’ve  got everything  I  need, inclXding a  perIect marriage.”
Only months later can she accept the Iact that she has Iallen oXt oI love with
her hXsband bXt that this does not mean that she made a horrible mistaNe.
Mr. E.,  also married two  years, begins to sXIIer intense headaches in the
evenings and can’t believe they are psychosomatic. “My home liIe is Iine. I
love my  wiIe  as mXch as the day I  married  her. She’s everything I  ever
wanted,” he says. BXt his headaches don’t leave him Xntil a year later, when
he is able to  admit, “She  bXgs the hell oXt oI  me the  way she is  always
wanting, wanting, wanting things withoXt regard to my salary,” and then is
able to conIront her with her e[travagance. Mr. and Mrs. F. acNnowledge to
each other that they have Iallen oXt oI love and then proceed to maNe each
other miserable by mXtXal rampant inIidelity as they each search Ior the one
“trXe love,”  not realizing  that their  very acNnowledgment coXld marN the
beginning oI  the  worN oI  their  marriage instead oI  its  end.  Even when
coXples have acNnowledged that the honeymoon is over, that they are no
longer  romantically  in   love  with   each other  and  are  able  still   to  be
committed to their relationship,  they still  cling to  the myth and attempt to
conIorm their lives to it. “Even  thoXgh we have Iallen oXt oI love, iI we act
by sheer will  power as iI  we still  were in love,  then maybe romantic love
will   retXrn  to   oXr   lives,”   their   thinNing  goes.  These  coXples  prize
togetherness. :hen  they enter coXples groXp therapy (which is the setting
in which  my  wiIe   and I  and oXr close  colleagXes condXct most serioXs
marriage coXnseling), they sit together, speaN Ior each other, deIend each
other’s IaXlts and seeN to present to the rest oI  the  groXp a Xnited Iront,

70
believing this Xnity to be a sign oI the relative health oI their marriage and a
prereTXisite Ior its improvement.  Sooner or later, and XsXally sooner, we
mXst tell most coXples that they are too mXch married, too closely coXpled,
and that they need to establish some psychological distance Irom each other
beIore they  can  even begin  to  worN  constrXctively  on  their  problems.
Sometimes it is  actXally necessary to physically  separate them, directing
them to sit apart Irom each other in the groXp circle. It is always necessary
to asN them to reIrain Irom speaNing Ior each other or deIending each other
against the groXp. Over and over again we mXst say, “Let Mary speaN Ior
herselI, John,” and “John can deIend himselI,  Mary, he’s strong enoXgh.”
Ultimately, iI they stay in therapy, all coXples learn that a trXe acceptance oI
their  own  and each  other’s  individXality  and  separateness is the  only•
IoXndation Xpon which a matXre marriage can be based and real love can
grow.*
         *  Those  who   have read  the  2’Neils’   book  2pen   Marriage   will
recognize this  to be  a basic tenet  of the  open as opposed to  the closed
marriage. The 2’Neils   were actually remarkably gentle  and restrained in
their proselytizing  for open marriage. My work  with couples has led me to
the  stark  conclusion  that   open marriage   is  the  only  kind   of  mature
marriage that   is healthy  and  not  seriously  destructive  to  the  spiritual
health and growth of the individual partners.

         More   About    Ego   Boundaries


         Having proclaimed that the e[perience oI “Ialling  in love”  is a sort oI
illXsion which in  no way constitXtes real love, let me conclXde by shiIting
into reverse and pointing oXt that Ialling in love is in Iact very, very close to
real love. Indeed, the misconception that Ialling in love is  a type oI love is
so potent precisely becaXse it contains a grain oI trXth.
         The e[perience oI real love also has to do with ego boXndaries, since
it  involves   an  e[tension  oI   one’s  limits.   One’s  limits   are  one’s  ego
boXndaries. :hen  we e[tend oXr limits throXgh love, we do so by reaching
oXt, so to speaN, toward the beloved, whose growth we wish to nXrtXre. For
Xs to be able to do this, the beloved obMect mXst Iirst become beloved to Xs;
in other words, we mXst be attracted toward, invested in and committed to

71
an obMect oXtside oI oXrselves, beyond the boXndaries oI selI. Psychiatrists
call this process oI attraction,  investment and commitment “cathe[is”  and
say that we “cathect”  the beloved obMect. BXt when: we cathect an obMect
oXtside oI oXrselves we also psychologically incorporate a representation oI
that obMect into oXrselves. For e[ample, let Xs consider a man who gardens
Ior a hobby. It is a satisIying and consXming hobby. He “loves” gardening.
His garden means a lot to him. This man has cathected his garden. He Iinds
it attractive, he has invested himselI in it, he is committed to it—so mXch so
that he may MXmp oXt oI bed early SXnday morning to get bacN to it, he may
reIXse to travel away Irom it, and he may even neglect his wiIe Ior it. In the
process oI his cathe[is  and in  order to nXrtXre his Ilowers  and shrXbs he
learns a great deal. He comes to Nnow mXch aboXt gardening—aboXt soils
and Iertilizers, rooting and prXning. And “he Nnows his particXlar garden—
its history, the types oI Ilowers and plants in it, its layoXt, its problems and
even its  IXtXre. Despite the  Iact  that  the garden  e[ists  oXtside oI  him,
throXgh his cathe[is it has also come to e[ist within him. His  Nnowledge oI
it and the meaning it has Ior him are part oI him, part oI his identity, part oI
his history, part oI his wisdom. By  loving and cathecting his garden he has
in  TXite a  real  way   incorporated the  garden  within   him,  and  by  this
incorporation  his   selI  has  become  enlarged  and  his   ego  boXndaries
e[tended.
         :hat    transpires  then in   the  coXrse oI  many  years oI   loving,  oI
e[tending  oXr   limits   Ior   oXr  cathe[es,  is   a  gradXal  bXt  progressive
enlargement oI the selI, an incorporation within oI the world withoXt, and a
growth, a stretching and a thinning oI  oXr ego boXndaries. In this way the
more and longer we e[tend oXrselves, the more we love, the more blXrred
becomes the  distinction  between  the  selI  and  the  world.  :e     become
identiIied with  the world.  And  as oXr ego boXndaries become blXrred and
thinned, we begin more and more to e[perience the same sort oI Ieeling oI
ecstasy that we have when oXr ego boXndaries partially  collapse and we
“Iall    in    love.”   Only,    instead   oI   having   merged   temporarily    and
Xnrealistically with  a single  beloved obMect, we have merged realistically
and more permanently with mXch oI the world. A “mystical Xnion” with the
entire world may be established. The Ieeling oI  ecstasy or bliss associated
with  this  Xnion, while  perhaps more  gentle and less  dramatic than  that
associated with Ialling in love, is nonetheless mXch more stable and lasting

72
and Xltimately satisIying. It  is the diIIerence between the peaN e[perience,
typiIied by Ialling  in love, and what Abraham Maslow has reIerred to as the
“plateaX e[perience.” *

preface.

         The  heights are  not  sXddenly glimpsed  and  lost  again;  they  are
attained Iorever.
         It is  obvioXs and generally Xnderstood that se[Xal activity and love,
while they may occXr simXltaneoXsly, oIten are disassociated, becaXse they
are basically separate phenomena. In itselI, maNing love  is not  an act oI
love. Nonetheless the e[perience oI se[Xal intercoXrse, and particXlarly oI
orgasm (even in  mastXrbation), is  an e[perience  also  associated with  a
greater or lesser degree oI collapse oI ego boXndaries and attendant ecstasy.
It is  becaXse oI this collapse oI ego boXndaries that we may shoXt at the
moment oI  clima[  “I   love  yoX” or  “Oh,  God”  to  a prostitXte Ior  whom
moments later, aIter the ego boXndaries have snapped bacN into place, we
may Ieel no shred oI aIIection, liNing or investment. This is not  to say that
the ecstasy oI the orgasmic e[perience cannot be heightened by sharing it
with one who is beloved; it can. BXt even withoXt a beloved partner or any
partner the collapse oI ego boXndaries occXrring in conMXnction with orgasm
may be total; Ior a second we may totally  Iorget who we are, lose tracN oI
selI, be lost in  time  and space, be oXtside oI oXr selI, be transported. :e
may become one with the Xniverse. BXt only Ior a second.
         In  describing the prolonged “oneness with  the Xniverse”  associated
with real love as compared to the momentary oneness oI orgasm, I Xsed the
words “mystical   Xnion.” Mysticism   is essentially  a belieI  that  reality  is
oneness. The most literal oI mystics believe that oXr common perception oI
the Xniverse as containing  mXltitXdes oI  discrete obMects—stars, planets,
trees,  birds;   hoXses, oXrselves—all  separated  Irom   one   another  by
boXndaries  is    a    misperception,   an   illXsion.    To    this    consensXal
misperception, this world oI  illXsion that most oI  Xs mistaNenly believe to
be real, HindXs  and BXddhists apply  the word  “Maya.”   They and  other
mystics hold  that  trXe  reality  can  be Nnown  only  by  e[periencing  the
oneness throXgh a giving Xp oI ego boXndaries. It is impossible to really see
the Xnity oI the Xniverse as long as one continXes to see oneselI as a discrete

73
obMect, separate and distingXishable   Irom  the  rest  oI  the  Xniverse  in  any
way, shape or  Iorm.   HindXs and  BXddhists  IreTXently  hold,  thereIore,  that
the inIant   beIore  the development   oI  ego boXndaries  Nnows reality,   while
adXlts do  not.  Some  even  sXggest that  the  path  toward  enlightenment   or
Nnowledge  oI   the  oneness  oI  reality   reTXires  that   we  regress  or   maNe
oXrselves liNe  inIants.   This   can  be  a dangeroXsly   tempting   doctrine  Ior
certain adolescents and  yoXng adXlts who  are not  prepared to  assXme adXlt
responsibilities,  which   seem Irightening   and overwhelming   and demanding
beyond their  capacities. “I  do  not have to go  throXgh all  this,”  sXch a person
may  thinN.  “I   can  give.  Xp  trying   to  be  an adXlt  and  retreat  Irom   adXlt
demands into  sainthood.”  Schizophrenia,  however,  rather than  sainthood,  is
achieved by acting  on this sXpposition.
         Most   mystics  Xnderstand the  trXth  that was  elaborated  at the  end oI
the  discXssion  oI   discipline:    namely,  that   we  mXst   possess or   achieve
something beIore  we  can give  it  Xp. and still  maintain  oXr  competence and
viability.   The inIant  withoXt  its  ego boXndaries may  be in closer  toXch with
reality  than its  parents,  bXt it  is  incapable oI  sXrviving   withoXt  the  care oI
these parents  and  incapable   oI  commXnicating   its   wisdom.   The  path  to

Ego boXndaries• mXst be hardened  beIore they  can be soItened. An  identity
mXst be established  beIore it  can  be transcended. One  mXst Iind  one’s  selI
beIore   one  can   lose   it.   The   temporary   release   Irom   ego   boXndaries
associated with   Ialling    in  love,   se[Xal   intercoXrse  or  the  Xse  oI  certain
psychoactive  drXgs may provide  Xs with  a glimpse  oI  Nirvana,  bXt not with
Nirvana   itselI.    It    is   a   thesis   oI   this    booN  that   Nirvana    or    lasting
enlightenment  or  trXe  spiritXal   growth  can  be  achieved  only   throXgh  the
persistent e[ercise  oI real  love.
         In  sXmmary,  then,  the temporary  loss  oI  ego boXndaries  involved   in
Ialling   in   love   and   in   se[Xal   intercoXrse   not   only   leads  Xs  to   maNe
commitments  to other people  Irom  which  real love may  begin bXt also gives
Xs a Ioretaste oI  (and  thereIore  an incentive   Ior)  the more  lasting  mystical
ecstasy that can  be oXrs aIter  a  liIetime   oI  love.  As  sXch, thereIore,  while
Ialling   in  love  is  not  itselI   love,  it   is  a part  oI  the  great  and  mysterioXs
scheme oI love.

         Dependency


         The second most common misconception aboXt love is the idea that
dependency is love. This is  a misconception with  which  psychotherapists
mXst deal on  a  daily  basis.  Its  eIIect  is  seen most  dramatically  in  an
individXal who maNes an attempt or gestXre or threat to commit sXicide or
who  becomes incapacitatingly  depressed in  response to  a  reMection or
separation Irom spoXse or lover. SXch a person says, “I do not want to live,
I cannot live  withoXt my  hXsband [wiIe, girlIriend,  boyIriend],  I love  him
[or  her]  so mXch.”  And  when  I  respond, as I   IreTXently do,  “YoX  are
mistaNen; yoX do  not  love  yoXr hXsband [wiIe,   girlIriend,  boyIriend].”
“:hat    do yoX mean?” is  the angry TXestion. “I  MXst told yoX I can’t live
withoXt him [or her].” I  try to e[plain:  “:hat   yoX describe is parasitism, not
love. :hen    yoX  reTXire another individXal  Ior  yoXr sXrvival,  yoX are  a
parasite on that individXal. There is no choice, no Ireedom involved in yoXr
relationship. It  is a  matter oI  necessity rather than love. Love  is the  Iree
e[ercise oI  choice. Two people love  each other only when  they are TXite
capable oI living withoXt each other bXt choose to live with each other.”
         I  deIine dependency as the inability  to  e[perience  wholeness or to
IXnction adeTXately withoXt the certainty that one is being actively cared Ior
by another. Dependency in  physical healthy  adXlts is  pathological—it  is
sicN, always a  maniIestation  oI  a  mental  illness  or  deIect. It   is  to  be
distingXished Irom what are commonly reIerred to as dependency needs or
Ieelings. :e   all—each and every  one oI Xs—even iI  we try  to pretend to
others and to oXrselves that we don’t have dependency needs and Ieelings.
All  oI  Xs have desires to be babied, to be nXrtXred withoXt eIIort  on oXr
parts, to be cared Ior  by persons stronger than Xs who have oXr interests
trXly at  heart. No  matter how  strong we  are, no  matter how  caring and
responsible and adXlt, iI we looN dearly into oXrselves we will Iind the wish
to be taNen care oI Ior a  change. Each one oI Xs, no matter how old  and
matXre, looNs Ior and  woXld liNe to  have in  his  or  her liIe  a  satisIying
mother IigXre and Iather IigXre. BXt Ior most oI Xs these desires or Ieelings
do not rXle oXr lives; they are not the predominant theme oI oXr e[istence.
:hen   they do rXle oXr lives and dictate the TXality oI oXr e[istence, then we
have something  more  than MXst dependency needs or Ieelings;  we  are

75
dependent. SpeciIically, one whose liIe is rXled and dictated by dependency
needs sXIIers Irom a psychiatric disorder to which we ascribe the diagnostic
name “passive  dependent personality  disorder.”  It  is  perhaps the  most
common oI all psychiatric disorders.
         People with   this  disorder, passive dependent people, are  so  bXsy
seeNing to be loved that  they have no  energy leIt to  love.  They are liNe
starving people, scroXnging wherever they can Ior Iood, and with no  Iood
oI their  own to  give to  others. It  is as iI  within  them they  have an inner
emptiness, a bottomless pit crying oXt to be Iilled  bXt which can never be
completely  Iilled.    They  never  Ieel   “IXll-Iilled”     or   have  a  sense  oI
completeness. They always Ieel “a  part oI  me is  missing.”  They tolerate
loneliness very poorly. BecaXse oI their lacN oI wholeness they have no real
sense oI identity, and they deIine themselves solely by their relationships. A
thirty-year-old pXnch press operator, e[tremely depressed, came to see me
three days aIter his wiIe  had leIt  him,  taNing their two  children. She had
threatened to leave him three times beIore, complaining oI his total lacN oI
attention to  her and the  children. Each time  he had  pleaded with  her to
remain and had promised to change, bXt his change had never lasted more
than a day, and this time she had carried oXt her threat. He had not slept Ior
two nights, was trembling with  an[iety,  had tears streaming down his Iace
and was serioXsly contemplating sXicide. “I can’t live withoXt my  Iamily,”
he said, weeping, “I love them so.”
         “I’m   pXzzled,”  I  said  to  him.  “YoX’ve   told  me  that  yoXr  wiIe’s
complaints were valid, that yoX never did  anything Ior her, that yoX came
home only when yoX pleased, that yoX weren’t interested in her se[Xally or
emotionally, that yoX woXldn’t even talN to the children Ior months on end,
that yoX never  played with   them or  tooN them anywhere.  YoX have no
relationship with any  oI yoXr Iamily,  so I don’t  Xnderstand why yoX’re so
depressed over the loss oI a relationship that never e[isted.”
         “Don’t  yoX see?” he replied. “I’m   nothing  now. Nothing. I  have no
wiIe. I  have no children. I don’t  Nnow who I am. I  may not care Ior them,
bXt I mXst love them. I am nothing withoXt them.”
         BecaXse he was so serioXsly depressed—having lost the identity that
his Iamily  gave him—I  made an appointment to  see him again two  days
later. I e[pected little  improvement. BXt when he retXrned he boXnced into
the oIIice grinning cheerIXlly and annoXnced, “Everything’s OK now.”

76
         “Did  yoX get bacN together with yoXr Iamily?” I asNed.
         “Oh, no,”  he replied happily, “I  haven’t heard Irom them since I saw
yoX. BXt I did  meet a girl  last night  down at  my bar. She said she really
liNes me. She’s separated, MXst liNe me. :e’ve got a date again tonight. I Ieel
liNe I’m hXman once more. I gXess I don’t have to see yoX again.”
         This   rapid  changeability   is  characteristic   oI   passive dependent
individXals. It is as iI  it does not matter whom they are dependent Xpon as
long as there is MXst someone. It does not matter what their identity  is as
long  as   there  is   someone  to  give   it   to   them.   ConseTXently, their
relationships, althoXgh seemingly dramatic in  their  intensity, are actXally
e[tremely shallow. BecaXse oI the strength oI their sense oI inner emptiness
and the hXnger to Iill  it,  passive dependent people will brooN no delay in
gratiIying their need Ior others. A beaXtiIXl, brilliant and in some ways very
healthy yoXng woman had, Irom  the  age oI  seventeen to twenty-one, an
almost endless series oI se[Xal relationships with  men invariably  beneath
her in terms oI intelligence  and capability. She went Irom one loser to the
ne[t.  The problem  as it  emerged was that  she was Xnable to  wait  long
enoXgh to seeN oXt a man sXited to her or even to choose Irom among the
many men almost immediately available  to her. :ithin    twenty-IoXr  hoXrs
aIter the ending oI a relationship she woXld picN Xp the Iirst man she met in
a bar and woXld come into her ne[t  therapy session singing his praises. “I
Nnow he’s  Xnemployed and  drinNs  too  mXch, bXt  basically  he’s  very
talented, and he really cares Ior me. I Nnow this relationship will worN.”
         BXt it never did  worN, not only becaXse she had not chosen well bXt
also becaXse she woXld  then  begin  a  pattern oI   clinging  to  the  man,
demanding more and more evidence oI his aIIection, seeNing to be with him
constantly, reIXsing to be leIt alone. “It is becaXse I love yoX so mXch that I
cannot bear to be separated Irom yoX,” she woXld tell  him, bXt sooner or
later he woXld Ieel totally stiIled and trapped, withoXt room to move, by her
“love.”   A   violent    blow-Xp  woXld   occXr,  the  relationship   woXld  be
terminated and the  cycle woXld  begin  all  over again  the ne[t   day. The
woman was able to breaN the cycle only aIter three years oI therapy, dXring
which she came to appreciate her own intelligence  and assets, to identiIy
her emptiness and hXnger and distingXish it Irom genXine love, to realize
how her hXnger was driving  her to  initiate and  cling to  relationships that

77
were detrimental to her, and to accept the necessity Ior the strictest Nind oI
discipline over her hXnger iI she was to capitalize on her assets.
         In the  diagnosis the word “passive”  is Xsed in conMXnction with the
word “dependent” becaXse these individXals concern themselves with what
others can do Ior  them to the  e[clXsion oI  what they  themselves can do.
Once, worNing with a groXp oI  Iive  single patients, all passive dependent
people, I asNed them to speaN oI their goals in terms oI what liIe sitXations
they wanted to Iind themselves in Iive  years hence. In one way or another
each oI them replied, “I want to be married to someone who really cares Ior
me.” Not  one mentioned holding down a challenging Mob, creating a worN
oI art, maNing a contribXtion to the commXnity, being in a position where he
or she  coXld love  or  even have children.  The  notion  oI  eIIort  was  not
involved  in  their: daydreams; they  envisioned only  an eIIortless  passive
state oI receiving care. I told them, as I tell many others: “II  being loved is
yoXr goal, yoX will  Iail to  achieve it. The only way  to be assXred oI being
loved is to be a person worthy oI love, and yoX cannot be a person worthy
oI love when yoXr primary goal in liIe  is to passively be loved.” This is not
to say that passive dependent people never do things Ior others, bXt their
motive in doing things is to cement the attachment oI the others to them so
as to assXre their own care. And when the possibility oI care Irom another is
not directly involved, they do have great diIIicXlty in “doing things.” All  the
members oI the aIorementioned groXp IoXnd it agonizingly diIIicXlt to bXy
a  hoXse, separate  Irom   their   parents,  locate  a  Mob, leave  a   totally
XnsatisIactory old Mob or even invest themselves in a hobby.
         In marriage there is normally a diIIerentiation  oI the roles oI the two
spoXses, a normally eIIicient division oI  labor between them. The woman
XsXally does the cooNing, hoXse-cleaning and shopping and cares Ior the
children;  the man  XsXally maintains  employment, handles the  Iinances,
mows the lawn and maNes repairs. Healthy coXples instinctively will switch
roles Irom time to time. The man may cooN a meal now and then, spend one
day a  weeN with the  children,  clean the hoXse to  sXrprise his wiIe;  the
woman may get a part-time Mob, mow the lawn on her hXsband’s birthday,
or taNe over the checNing accoXnt and bill-paying Ior  a year. The coXple
may oIten thinN oI this role switching as a Nind oI play that adds spice and
variety to their marriage. It is this, bXt perhaps more important (even iI it is
done  XnconscioXsly),  it   is   a   process  that   diminishes   their   mXtXal

78
dependency. In a  sense, each spoXse is  training  himselI  or  herselI  Ior
sXrvival in  the event oI  the  loss oI  the other. BXt  Ior  passive dependent
people the loss oI the other is sXch a Irightening prospect that they cannot
Iace preparing  Ior   it  or   tolerating  a  process that  woXld  diminish   the
dependency or increase the Ireedom oI the other. ConseTXently it is one oI
the behavioral hallmarNs oI passive dependent people in marriage that their
role diIIerentiation  is rigid,  and they seeN to increase rather than diminish
mXtXal dependency so as to maNe marriage more rather than less oI a trap. 
By  so  doing,  in  the  name  oI  what  they  call   love  bXt  what  is  really
dependency, they diminish their own and each other’s Ireedom and statXre. 
Occasionally, as  part  oI  this   process, passive dependent people  when
married will  actXally IorsaNe sNills that they had gained beIore marriage. 
An e[ample oI this  is the not Xncommon syndrome oI the wiIe who “can’t”
drive a car.  HalI the time in sXch sitXations she may never have learned, bXt
in the remaining  cases, sometimes allegedly becaXse oI a minor accident,
she develops a “phobia”  aboXt driving  at  some point aIter  marriage and
stops.  The eIIect oI this “phobia”  in rXral and sXbXrban areas, where most
people live, is  to render her almost totally  dependent on her hXsband and
chain her hXsband to her  by her  helplessness.  Now he  mXst do all  the
shopping Ior the Iamily  himselI  or he mXst chaXIIeXr her on all shopping
e[peditions.  BecaXse this behavior XsXally gratiIies the dependency needs
oI both spoXses, it is almost never seen as sicN or even as a problem to be
solved by  most  coXples.  :hen    I  sXggested to  an otherwise  e[tremely
intelligent banNer that his wiIe, who sXddenly stopped driving at age Iorty-
si[  becaXse oI a “phobia,” might  have a problem deserving oI psychiatric
attention, he said, “Oh, no, the doctor told her it was becaXse oI menopaXse,
and yoX can’t do  anything aboXt that.” She was secXre in the Nnowledge
that he woXld not have an aIIair and leave her becaXse he was so bXsy aIter
worN taNing her shopping and driving the children aroXnd.  He was secXre
in the Nnowledge that she woXld not have an aIIair and leave him becaXse
she did not have the mobility to  meet people when he was away Irom her.
ThroXgh sXch behavior, passive dependent marriages may be made lasting
and secXre, bXt they  cannot  be  considered either  healthy or  genXinely
loving, becaXse the secXrity is pXrchased at the price oI Ireedom and the
relationship serves to retard or destroy the growth oI the individXal partners.

79
Again and again we tell  oXr coXples that “a good marriage can e[ist  only
between two strong and independent people.”
         Passive dependency has its genesis in lacN oI love. The inner Ieeling
oI emptiness Irom which passive dependent people sXIIer is the direct resXlt
oI their parents’ IailXre to IXlIill  their needs Ior aIIection, attention and care
dXring their childhood.  It was  mentioned in the Iirst  section that children
who are loved and cared Ior with relative consistency throXghoXt childhood
enter adXlthood  with   a  deep-seated Ieeling that   they  are lovable   and
valXable and thereIore will be loved  and cared Ior as long as they remain
trXe to themselves. Children growing  Xp in  an atmosphere in which  love
and care are lacNing or given with gross inconsistency enter adXlthood with
no  sXch sense oI  inner  secXrity.  Rather, they  have  an  inner  sense oI
insecXrity, a Ieeling oI “I  don’t have enoXgh” and a sense that the world is
Xnpredictable and Xngiving,  as well  as  a sense oI  themselves as being
TXestionably lovable and valXable. It is no wonder, then, that they Ieel the
need to scramble Ior love care and attention wherever they can Iind it, and
once having  IoXnd It,  cling  to  it  with   a desperation that  leads them to
Xnloving,  manipXlative, Machiavellian   behavior  that  destroys  the  very
relationship they seeN to preserve. As also indicated in the previoXs section,
love and discipline go hand in hand, so that Xnloving, Xncaring parents are
people lacNing in discipline,  and when they  Iail  to provide  their children
with a sense oI being loved, they also Iail to provide them with the capacity
Ior selI-discipline. ThXs the e[cessive dependency oI the passive dependent
individXals is only the principal  maniIestation oI their personality disorder.
Passive dependent people lacN selI-discipline. They are Xnwilling or Xnable
to delay gratiIication  oI  their hXnger Ior  attention. In  their desperation to
Iorm and preserve attachments they throw honesty to the winds. They cling
to oXtworn relationships when they shoXld give them Xp. Most important,
they lacN a sense oI responsibility Ior  themselves. They passively looN to
others, IreTXently even their own children, as the soXrce oI their happiness
and IXll-Iillment,   and thereIore when  they aren’t  happy or  IXlIilled  they
basically Ieel that others are responsible. ConseTXently they are endlessly
angry, becaXse they endlessly Ieel let down  by  others who can  never in
reality IXlIill  all  their needs or “maNe” them happy. I have a colleagXe who
oIten tells  people, ‘“LooN,  allowing  yoXrselI to  be dependent on another
person is the worst  possible thing yoX can do  to yoXrselI. YoX woXld  be

80
better oII being dependent on heroin. As  long as yoX have a sXpply oI it,
heroin will never let yoX down; iI  it’s there, it will  always maNe yoX happy.
BXt iI  yoX e[pect  another person to maNe yoX happy, yoX’ll be endlessly
disappointed.” As a matter oI Iact,  it is no  accident that the most common
distXrbance  that   passive   dependent  people   maniIest   beyond    their
relationships to others is  dependency on drXgs and alcohol. Theirs is  the
“addictive personality.”  They are addicted to people, sXcNing on them and
gobbling them  Xp, and when  people are not  available to  be sXcNed and
gobbled, they oIten tXrn to the bottle or  the needle or the pill as a people-
sXbstitXte.
         In sXmmary, dependency may appear to be love becaXse It is a Iorce
that caXses people to  Iiercely  attach themselves to  one another. BXt  in
actXality it is not love; it is a Iorm oI antilove. It has its genesis in a parental
IailXre to love and it perpetXates the IailXre. It seeNs to receive rather than to
give.  It  noXrishes inIantilism  rather  than  growth.  It  worNs  to  trap and
constrict rather than  to liberate.  Ultimately  it  destroys rather than bXilds
relationships, and it destroys rather than bXilds people.

         Cathe[is     Without     LoYe


         One oI   the aspects oI  dependency is  that it   is  Xnconcerned with
spiritXal growth. Dependent people are interested in their own noXrishment,
bXt no more; they desire Iilling, they desire to be happy; they don’t desire to
grow, nor are they  willing  to  tolerate the Xnhappiness, the loneliness and
sXIIering involved in  growth. Neither  do dependent people care aboXt the
spiritXal growth oI the other, the obMect oI their dependency; they care only
that the other is there to satisIy them. Dependency is bXt one oI the Iorms oI
behavior to which we incorrectly  apply the word  “love”  when concern Ior
spiritXal evolXtion is absent. :e   will   now consider other sXch Iorms, and
we hope to  demonstrate again that  love  is never  nXrtXrance or cathe[is
withoXt regard to spiritXal growth.
         :e   IreTXently speaN oI people loving inanimate obMects or activities.
ThXs we say, “He   loves money”  or  “He  loves  power”  or  “He  loves  to
garden or  “He  loves to  play  golI.”   Certainly  an individXal  may  e[tend
himselI or  herselI  mXch beyond ordinary  personal limits,  worNing si[ty,

81
seventy, eighty hoXrs a weeN to amass wealth  or power. Yet  despite the
e[tent oI one’s IortXne or inIlXence, all this worN and accXmXlation may not
be selI-enlarging at all. Indeed, we may oIten say aboXt a selI-made tycoon,
“He’s a small person, mean and petty.” :hile  we may talN aboXt how mXch
this person loves money or power, we IreTXently do not perceive him as a
loving person. :hy    is this so? It is becaXse wealth or power have become
Ior sXch people ends in themselves rather than means to a spiritXal  goal.
The only trXe end oI love is spiritXal growth or hXman evolXtion.
         Hobbies are  selI-nXrtXring activities.  In   loving  oXrselves—that is,
nXrtXring oXrselves Ior the pXrpose oI spiritXal growth—we need to provide
oXrselves with all Ninds oI things that are not directly spiritXal. To noXrish
the spirit the body  mXst also be noXrished. :e  need Iood  and shelter. No
matter how dedicated we are to spiritXal development, we also need rest and
rela[ation,  e[ercise and  distraction. Saints mXst sleep and even prophets
mXst play. ThXs hobbies may be a means throXgh which we love oXrselves.
BXt iI  a hobby becomes an end in  itselI, then it  becomes a sXbstitXte Ior
rather than a means to selI-development. Sometimes it is precisely becaXse
they are sXbstitXtes Ior selI-development that hobbies are so popXlar. On
golI coXrses, Ior instance, one may Iind some aging men and women whose
chieI remaining goal in liIe  is to  NnocN a Iew more stroNes oII their game.
This dedicated eIIort to improve  their sNill  serves to give them a sense oI
progress in liIe  and thereby assists them in  ignoring the  reality  that they
have actXally stopped progressing, having given Xp the eIIort  to improve
themselves as hXman beings. II they loved themselves more they woXld not
allow themselves to passionately settle Ior sXch a shallow goal and narrow
IXtXre.
         On the other hand, power and money may be means to a loving goal.
A  person may,  Ior  instance, sXIIer a  career in  politics   Ior  the  primary
pXrpose oI Xtilizing political power Ior the betterment oI the hXman race. Or
some people may yearn Ior riches, not Ior money’s saNe bXt in order to send
their children to  college or provide themselves with the  Ireedom and time
Ior stXdy and reIlection which are necessary Ior their own spiritXal growth.
It is not power or money that sXch people love; it is hXmanity.
         Among the things that I am saying here and throXghoXt this section oI
the booN is that oXr Xse oI the word “love” is so generalized and XnspeciIic
as to severely  interIere with  oXr  Xnderstanding oI love.  I  have no great

82
e[pectation that the langXage will change in this respect. Yet as long as we
continXe to Xse the word “love” to  describe oXr relationship with anything
that is important to Xs, anything we cathect, withoXt regard Ior the TXality
oI  that  relationship, we  will   continXe  to  have diIIicXlty   discerning  the
diIIerence between the wise and the Ioolish, the good and the bad, the noble
and the ignoble. Using oXr more speciIic deIinition, it is clear, Ior instance,
that , we  can love  only  hXman beings. For, as we generally  conceive oI
things, it is  only hXman beings who possess a spirit capable oI sXbstantial
growth. *
         * I  recognize the possibility  that this  conception may be a false one;
that all matter, animate and inanimate, may possess spirit. The distinction
of ourselves as humans being  different from  “lower”   animals and plants
and from inanimate earth and rocks, is a manifestation of maya, or illusion,
in the  mystical frame of  reference. There are levels of  understanding. In
this book I am dealing with  love at a certain level. Unfortunately my  skills
of communicating are inadequate to  encompass more than one level at a
time or to do more than provide an occasional glimpse of a level other than
the one on which I am communicating.

         Consider the matter oI pets. :e “love”   the Iamily dog. :e   Ieed it and
bathe it, pet it and cXddle it, discipline it and play with it. :hen  it is sicN we
may drop everything and rXsh it to the veterinarian. :hen   it  rXns away or
dies we  may  be grieI-stricNen. Indeed,  Ior  some lonely  people  withoXt
children, their pets may become the sole reason Ior their e[istence. II this is
not love  then  what is?  BXt let  Xs e[amine  the  diIIerences between oXr
relationship with a pet and that with  another hXman being. First oI all, the
e[tent   oI  oXr  commXnication  with   oXr   pets  is  e[tremely   limited   in
comparison with  the  e[tent  to  which  we  may  commXnicate with  other
hXmans iI we worN at it. :e   do not Nnow what oXr pets are thinNing. This
lacN oI Nnowledge allows Xs to proMect onto oXr pets oXr own thoXghts and
Ieelings, and thereby to Ieel an emotional closeness with them which may
not correspond to reality at all.  Second, we Iind oXr pets satisIactory only
insoIar as their  wills  coincide  with  oXrs. This  is the  basis on which  we
generally select oXr pets, and iI  their  wills  begin to  diverge signiIicantly
Irom oXr own,  we get rid  oI  them. :e    don’t Neep pets aroXnd very long
when they protest or  Iight bacN against Xs. The only school to  which  we

send oXr pets Ior  the development oI  their minds  or spirits  is  obedience
school. Yet it is possible Ior Xs to desire that other hXmans develop a “will
oI their own”; indeed, it is this desire Ior the diIIerentiation oI  the other that
is one oI the characteristics oI genXine love. Finally, in oXr relationship with
pets we seeN to Ioster their dependency. :e do not  want them to grow Xp
and leave home. :e    want  them to  stay  pXt, to  lie  dependably near the
hearth. It is their  attachment to Xs rather than their independence Irom Xs
that we valXe in oXr pets.
         This matter oI the “love”  oI pets is oI immense import becaXse many,
many people are capable oI “loving”  only pets and incapable oI genXinely
loving other hXman beings. Large nXmbers oI American soldiers had idyllic
marriages to German, Italian  or  Japanese “war brides”  with  whom  they
coXld not verbally commXnicate. BXt when their brides learned English, the
marriages began to Iall apart. The servicemen coXld then no longer proMect
Xpon their wives their own thoXghts, Ieelings, desires and goals and Ieel the
same sense oI closeness one Ieels with a pet. Instead, as their wives learned
English, the men began to realize that these women had ideas, opinions and
aims diIIerent Irom  their  own. As  this happened, love began to grow  Ior
some; Ior most, perhaps, it ceased. The liberated woman is right to beware
oI the  man who  aIIectionately calls  her his “pet.”   He may  indeed be an
individXal whose aIIection is dependent Xpon her being a pet, who lacNs the
capacity to respect her strength, independence and individXality. Probably
the most saddening e[ample oI this phenomenon is the very large nXmber
oI women who are capable oI “loving”  their  children only as inIants. SXch
women can be IoXnd everywhere. They  may be ideal  mothers Xntil their
children reach the age oI  two—inIinitely   tender, MoyoXsly breast-Ieeding,
cXddling and playing  with   their  babies, consistently aIIectionate,  totally
dedicated to their nXrtXre, and blissIXlly happy in their motherhood. Then,
almost overnight, the pictXre changes. As soon as a child begins to assert its
own will—to   disobey, to  whine, to  reIXse to  play, to  occasionally reMect
being cXddled, to attach itselI to other people, to move oXt into the world a
little  bit  on its  own—the  mother’s love  ceases. She loses interest in the
child, decathects it, perceives it only  as a nXisance. At the same time she
will  oIten Ieel an almost overpowering need to be pregnant again, to have
another inIant,  another pet. UsXally  she will   sXcceed, and the cycle’  is
repeated. II not, she may be seen avidly seeNing to baby-sit Ior the inIant

84
children oI  neighbors while  almost totally  ignoring  the pleas oI  her own
older child or children Ior  attention. For her children the “terrible twos” are
not only the end oI their inIancy, they are also the end oI the e[perience oI
being loved  by   mother. The  pain  and  deprivation  they  e[perience  are
obvioXs to all e[cept their  mother, bXsy with her new inIant. The eIIect  oI
this e[perience is XsXally evidenced as the children grow to adXlthood in a
depressive and/or passive dependent personality pattern.
         :hat    this sXggests is that the  “love”  oI  inIants  and pets and even
dependently obedient spoXses is an instinctXal pattern oI behavior to which
it  is  TXite  appropriate to  apply   the term   “maternal  instinct”   or,  more
generally, “parental instinct.”  :e   can liNen this to the instinctXal behavior
oI “Ialling   in love”:  it  is not a genXine Iorm oI  love in  that it is  relatively
eIIortless, and it  is not  totally  an act oI  will  or  choice; it  encoXrages the
sXrvival oI   the  species bXt is  not  directed  toward  its  improvement  or
spiritXal growth; it is close to love in  that it is a reaching oXt Ior others and
serves to initiate interpersonal bonds Irom which real love might begin; bXt
a good deal more is reTXired to develop a healthy, creative marriage, raise a
healthy, spiritXally growing child or contribXte to the evolXtion oI hXmanity.
         The point is  that nXrtXring can be and XsXally shoXld be mXch more
than simple Ieeding, and that nXrtXring spiritXal growth is an inIinitely more
complicated process than  can  be directed  by  any  instinct.  The  mother
mentioned at the beginning oI this section who woXld  not let her son taNe
the bXs to school is a case in point. By driving him to and Irom school she
was nXrtXring him in a sense, bXt it was a nXrtXring he did not need and that
clearly retarded rather than IXrthered his spiritXal growth. Other e[amples
aboXnd: mothers who  pXsh Iood  on  their  already  overweight  children;
.Iathers who bXy  their  sons whole roomIXls  oI  toys and  their  daXghters
whole closetIXls oI clothes; parents who set no limits and deny no desires.
Love is not simply  giving;  it is judicious  giving and MXdicioXs withholding
as well.  It  is  MXdicioXs praising and MXdicioXs criticizing. It is MXdicioXs
argXing, strXggling, conIronting, Xrging, pXshing and pXlling in addition to
comIorting.   It   is   leadership.  The  word   “MXdicioXs” means  reTXiring
MXdgment, and MXdgment reTXires more than instinct; it reTXires thoXghtIXl
and oIten painIXl decision maNing

85
         “SelI    SacriIice”


         The motives behind inMXdicioXs giving and destrXctive nXrtXring are
many, bXt sXch  cases invariably  have a.  basic IeatXre in   common: the
“giver,”  Xnder the gXise oI love,  is responding to  and meeting his or  her
own needs withoXt regard to the spiritXal needs oI the receiver. A minister
relXctantly came to see me becaXse his wiIe was sXIIering Irom a chronic
depression and both his sons had dropped oXt oI college and were living at
home and receiving psychiatric  attention. Despite the Iact  that his  whole
Iamily was “ill,”   he was initially  completely  Xnable to comprehend that he
might be playing a role  in their illnesses. “I  do everything in  my power to
taNe care oI them and their problems,” he reported. “I don’t have a waNing
moment when I  am not concerned aboXt them.” Analysis  oI the sitXation
revealed that this man was indeed worNing himselI to the bone to meet the
demands oI his wiIe and children. He had given both oI  his sons new cars
and paid the  insXrance on them even thoXgh he Ielt  the  boys shoXld be
pXtting .more eIIort into being selI-sXpporting. Each weeN he tooN his wiIe
to the  opera or the  theater in the  city  even thoXgh he intensely  disliNed
going to the city, and opera bored him to death. BXsy thoXgh he was on his
Mob, he spent most oI his Iree time at home picNing Xp aIter his wiIe  and
sons, who had a total disregard Ior hoXsecleaning. “Don’t yoX get tired oI
laying yoXrselI oXt  Ior them  all the  time?”  I asNed him. “OI  coXrse,” he
replied, “bXt  what  else am  I  to  do? I  love  them  and I  have  too mXch
compassion not to taNe care oI them. My concern Ior them is so great that I
will  never allow myselI to stand by as long as they have needs to be Iilled. I
may not be a brilliant man, bXt at least I have love and concern.”
         Interestingly,  it  emerged that  his  own  Iather  had been a  brilliant
scholar oI considerable renown, bXt also an alcoholic and philanderer who
showed a total lacN oI concern Ior the Iamily and was grossly neglectIXl oI
them. GradXally my patient was helped to see that as a child he had vowed
to be as diIIerent  Irom his  Iather as possible, to be as compassionate and
concerned as his Iather was heartless and Xnconcerned. He was even able to
Xnderstand aIter a while that he had a tremendoXs staNe in maintaining an
image oI   himselI  as loving   and  compassionate, and that  mXch oI   his
behavior, inclXding his career in the ministry, had been devoted to Iostering

86
this image. :hat  he did not Xnderstand so easily was the degree to which he
was inIantilizing   his Iamily.  He  continXally  reIerred to  his  wiIe  as “my
Nitten” and to his IXll-grown, strapping sons as “my little ones.” “How  else
can I behave?” he pleaded. “I may  be loving in  reaction to my  Iather, bXt
that doesn’t  mean I’m  going  to  become Xnloving  or tXrn  myselI  into  a
bastard.” :hat   he literally had to be taXght was that loving is a complicated
rather than a simple activity, reTXiring the participation oI  his entire being
—his head as well  as his  heart. BecaXse oI his need to  be as XnliNe his
Iather as possible,  he had not  been able  to develop  a Ile[ible    response
system Ior e[pressing his love. He had to learn that  not giving at the right
time was  more  compassionate than giving  at  the wrong  time,  and  that
Iostering independence was more loving  than taNing care oI  people who
coXld otherwise  taNe  care oI   themselves. He  even  had  to   learn  that
e[pressing his own  needs, anger, resentments and e[pectations was every
bit as necessary to the mental health oI his Iamily as his selI-sacriIice, and
thereIore that  love  mXst be maniIested  in  conIrontation  as mXch as  in
beatiIic acceptance.
         GradXally coming to realize how he inIantilized  his Iamily, he began
to maNe changes. He stopped picNing Xp aIter everyone and became openly
angry when his sons did not adeTXately participate in the care oI the home.
He reIXsed to continXe paying Ior  the insXrance on his sons’ cars, telling
them that iI they wanted to drive they woXld have to pay Ior it  themselves.
He sXggested that his wiIe shoXld go alone to the opera in  New YorN. In
maNing these changes he had to risN appearing to be the “bad gXy” and had
to give Xp the omnipotence oI his Iormer role as provider Ior  all the needs
oI the Iamily.  BXt even thoXgh his previoXs behavior had been motivated
primarily by  a need to maintain an image oI himselI as a loving person, he
had at his core a capacity Ior genXine love, and becaXse oI this capacity he
was able to accomplish these alterations in himselI. Both his  wiIe and his
sons reacted to these changes initially with anger. BXt soon one son went
bacN to college, and the  other IoXnd  a more demanding Mob and got an
apartment Ior himselI. His wiIe  began to enMoy her new independence and
to grow   in  ways oI   her own.  The  man  IoXnd himselI  becoming  more
eIIective as a minister and at the same time his liIe became more enMoyable.
         The  minister’s   misgXided   love   bordered  on   the  more   serioXs
perversion oI love that is masochism. Laymen tend to associate sadism and

87
masochism with  pXrely  se[Xal  activity,  thinNing oI   them as  the se[Xal
enMoyment derived Irom inIlicting or receiving physical pain. ActXally, trXe
se[Xal sadomasochism is a relatively Xncommon Iorm oI psychopathology.
MXch,  mXch   more   common,   and  Xltimately    more  serioXs,  is    the
phenomenon oI  social  sadomasochism, in  which  people  XnconscioXsly
desire  to  hXrt   and  be  hXrt   by   each  other  throXgh  their   nonse[Xal
interpersonal relations.   Prototypically   a  woman   will   seeN psychiatric
attention Ior depression in response to desertion by her hXsband. She will
regale the psychiatrist with an endless tale oI repeated mistreatment by her
hXsband: he paid her no attention, he had a string oI mistresses, he gambled
away the  Iood  money, he  went  away Ior   days at  a  time  whenever he
pleased, he came home drXnN and beat her, and now, Iinally, he’s deserted
her and the children on Christmas Eve—Christmas Eve yet! The neophyte
therapist tends to respond to this “poor  woman”  and her tale with  instant
sympathy, bXt it does not taNe long Ior  the sympathy to  evaporate in the
light oI  IXrther Nnowledge. First the therapist discovers that this pattern oI
mistreatment has e[isted Ior twenty years, and that while  the poor woman
divorced her brXte oI a hXsband twice, she also remarried him twice,  and
that innXmerable separations were Iollowed by innXmerable reconciliations.
Ne[t,  aIter worNing with  her  Ior  a month or  two  to assist her in  gaining
independence, and when everything seemingly is going well and the woman
appears to be enMoying the tranTXility oI liIe apart Irom  her hXsband, the
therapist sees the cycle enacted all over again. The woman happily boXnces
into the oIIice  one day to annoXnce, “:ell,   Henry’s  come bacN. He called
Xp the other night saying he wanted to see me, so I did see him. He pleaded
with me to come bacN, and he really seems changed, so I tooN him bacN.”
:hen   the  therapist points oXt that  this seems to be bXt  a repetition oI  a
pattern they had agreed was destrXctive, the woman says, “BXt I love him.
YoX can’t deny love.” II  the therapist attempts to e[amine this “love”  with
any strenXoXsness, then the patient terminates therapy.
         :hat    is going on  here? In trying  to Xnderstand what has happened,
the therapist recalls the obvioXs relish with which the woman had recoXnted
the long history  oI  her hXsband’s brXtality and mistreatment. SXddenly a
strange idea begins to  dawn;  maybe this  woman endXres her hXsband’s
mistreatment, and even seeNs it oXt, Ior the very pleasXre oI talNing aboXt it.
BXt what woXld be the  natXre oI sXch pleasXre? The therapist remembers

88
the woman’s selI-righteoXsness. CoXld it be that the most important thing in
the woman’s liIe is to have a sense oI moral sXperiority and that in order to
maintain this sense she needs to be mistreated? The natXre oI the pattern
now becomes clear. By allowing  herselI to  be treated basely she can Ieel
sXperior. Ultimately she can even have the sadistic pleasXre oI seeing her
hXsband beg  and plead  to   retXrn,  and  momentarily  acNnowledge her
sXperiority Irom his hXmbled position, while she decides whether or not to
magnanimoXsly taNe him  bacN. And  in   this  moment she  achieves her
revenge. :hen   sXch women are e[amined  it is  generally IoXnd that  they
were particXlarly  hXmiliated  as children.  As  a resXlt  they seeN revenge
throXgh  their   sense  oI    moral   sXperiority,   which   reTXires  repeated
hXmiliation and mistreatment. II  the world  is treating Xs well  we have no
need to avenge oXrselves on it. II seeNing revenge is oXr goal in liIe, we will
have to see to it that the world  treats Xs badly in order to MXstiIy oXr goal.
Masochists looN on their sXbmission to  mistreatment as love, whereas in
Iact  it  is  a  necessity in  their   never-ceasing search Ior  revenge and  is
basically motivated by hatred.
         The   issXe  oI   masochism   highlights   still    another  very   maMor
misconception aboXt love—that it is selI-sacriIice.  By virtXe oI  this belieI
the prototypical masochist was enabled to see her tolerance oI mistreatment
as  selI-sacriIice  and  hence  as  love,   and  thereIore   did  not   have  to
acNnowledge her hatred. The minister also saw his selI-sacriIicial behavior
as love, althoXgh actXally it was motivated not by  the needs oI his Iamily
bXt by his own need to maintain an image oI himselI. Early in his treatment
he woXld continXally talN aboXt how he “did  things  Ior”  his wiIe  and his
children, leading one to believe that he himselI got nothing oXt oI sXch acts.
BXt he  did.   :henever    we  thinN oI   oXrselves as doing  something  for
someone else,  we  are  in   some way   denying  oXr  own  responsibility.
:hatever   we  do is  done becaXse we choose to do it,  and we  maNe that
choice becaXse it is the one that satisIies Xs the most. :hatever we do Ior
someone else we do becaXse it IXlIills a need we have. Parents who say to
their children, “YoX  shoXld be grateIXl Ior all that  we have done Ior yoX”
are invariably  parents who  are  lacNing in  love  to  a  signiIicant  degree.
Anyone  who  genXinely loves  Nnows the pleasXre oI  loving.   :hen    we
genXinely love  we  do  so becaXse we Zant   to  love.  :e    have  children
becaXse we want to have children, and iI we are loving parents, it is becaXse

89
we want to be loving  parents. It is  trXe that love involves a change in the
selI, bXt this is an e[tension oI the selI rather than a sacriIice oI the selI: As
will  be discXssed again later, genXine love is a  selI-replenishing activity.
Indeed, it is even more; it enlarges rather than diminishes the selI; it Iills the
selI rather than depleting it.  In  a real sense love is  as selIish as nonlove.
Here again there is a parado[ in that love is both selIish and XnselIish at the
same time. It is not selIishness or XnselIishness that distingXishes love Irom
nonlove; it is  the aim oI the  action. In the case oI genXine love the aim is
always spiritXal growth. In the case oI nonlove the aim is always something
else.

         LoYe  Is  Not   A  Feeling


         I have said that love  is an action, an activity.  This leads to the Iinal
maMor misconception oI love which needs to be addressed. Love is not a
Ieeling. Many, many people possessing a Ieeling oI love and even acting in
response to that Ieeling act in all manner oI Xnloving and destrXctive ways.
On the other hand, a genXinely loving individXal will oIten taNe loving and
constrXctive action toward a person he or she conscioXsly disliNes, actXally
Ieeling no love toward the person at the time and perhaps even Iinding the
person repXgnant in some way.
         The Ieeling oI love is the emotion that accompanies the e[perience oI
cathecting. Cathecting, it will  be remembered, is the process by which  an
obMect becomes important to Xs. Once cathected, the  obMect, commonly
reIerred to as a “love obMect,” is invested with oXr energy as iI it were a part
oI oXrselves, and this  relationship between Xs and the invested obMect is
called a cathe[is. Since we may have many sXch relationships going on at
the same time, we speaN oI oXr cathe[es. The process oI withdrawing oXr
energy Irom a love obMect so that it loses its sense oI importance Ior Xs is
Nnown as decathecting. The  misconception that  love  is a  Ieeling  e[ists
becaXse  we   conIXse   cathecting   with     loving.    This    conIXsion   is
Xnderstandable since they are similar processes, bXt there are also striNing
diIIerences. First oI all, as has been pointed oXt, we may cathect any obMect,
animate or inanimate, with or  withoXt a spirit.  ThXs a person may cathect
the stocN marNet or a piece oI Mewelry and may Ieel love Ior these things.

90
Second, the Iact that we have cathected another hXman being does not mean
that we care a whit Ior  that person’s spiritXal development. The dependent
person, in  Iact,  XsXally  Iears the  spiritXal  development oI   a cathected
spoXse. The mother who insisted Xpon driving  her adolescent son to and
Irom school  clearly cathected the boy;  he was important  to  her—bXt his
spiritXal growth was not. Third, the intensity oI oXr cathe[es IreTXently has
nothing to do  with wisdom  or commitment. Two  strangers may meet in a
bar and cathect  each other in  sXch a  way  that nothing—not  previoXsly
schedXled appointments, promises  made,  or  Iamily   stability—is   more
important Ior   the moment  than their  se[Xal  consXmmation. Finally,  oXr
cathe[es may  be  Ileeting  and  momentary. Immediately   Iollowing   their
se[Xal  consXmmation the  MXst mentioned coXple may  Iind  each  other
Xnattractive and Xndesirable. :e may  decathect something almost as soon
as we have cathected it.
         GenXine love,   on  the  other  hand,  implies  commitment   and  the
e[ercise  oI  wisdom.   :hen    we  are  concerned  Ior  someone’s  spiritXal
growth, we Nnow that a lacN oI commitment is liNely to be harmIXl and that
commitment to  that person is  probably necessary Ior  Xs to maniIest  oXr
concern eIIectively. It is Ior this  reason that commitment is the cornerstone
oI the psychotherapeXtic relationship. It is almost impossible Ior a patient to
e[perience signiIicant  personality growth  withoXt a “therapeXtic alliance”
with the therapist. In other words, beIore the patient can risN maMor change
he or she mXst Ieel the strength and secXrity that come Irom believing that
the therapist is  the patient’s constant and stable ally.  For  this alliance  to
occXr the   therapist  mXst  demonstrate to   the  patient,  XsXally  over  a
considerable length oI  time,  the consistent and steadIast caring  that can
arise only Irom  a  capacity Ior  commitment. This  does not mean that the
therapist always Ieels liNe listening to the patient. Commitment means that
the therapist listens  to  the patient, liNe  it  or  not.  It  is no  diIIerent  in  a
marriage. In  a constrXctive marriage, MXst as in constrXctive therapy, the
partners mXst regXlarly, roXtinely and predictably, attend to each other and
their relationship no matter how they Ieel. As has been mentioned, coXples
sooner or later always Iall  oXt oI  love, and it  is  at the moment when  the
mating instinct  has rXn  its  coXrse that the opportXnity  Ior  genXine love
begins. It  is when  the spoXses no longer Ieel  liNe being  in  each other’s

91
company always, when they woXld rather be elsewhere some oI the time,
that their love begins to be tested and will be IoXnd to be present or absent.
         This  is   not   to  say   that  the   partners in   a   stable,  constrXctive
relationship sXch as intensive  psychotherapy or marriage  do not  cathect
each other and the relationship itselI in varioXs ways; they do. :hat it  does
say is that genXine love transcends the matter oI cathe[es. :hen love e[ists
it does so with or withoXt cathe[is and with or withoXt a loving Ieeling. It is
easier—indeed, it is IXn—to love with cathe[is and the Ieeling oI love. BXt
it is possible to love withoXt cathe[is  and withoXt loving Ieelings, and it  is
in the IXlIillment   oI this  possibility  that genXine and transcendent love is
distingXished Irom  simple cathe[is.   The Ney word  in  this  distinction  is
“will.”   I have deIined love as the Zill  to  e[tend oneselI Ior  the pXrpose oI
nXrtXring one’s  own   and  another’s  spiritXal  growth.  GenXine  love  is
volitional  rather  than  emotional.  The  person  who  trXly  loves  does so
becaXse oI a decision to love. This person has made a commitment to be
loving  whether or not  the loving  Ieeling  is  present. II it  is,  so mXch the
better; bXt iI it  isn’t,  the commitment to love,  the will  to  love, still  stands
and is still e[ercised. Conversely, it is not only possible bXt necessary Ior a
loving person to avoid acting on Ieelings oI love. I may meet a woman who
strongly attracts  me, whom  I  Ieel  liNe loving,   bXt becaXse it woXld  be
destrXctive to my marriage to have an aIIair at that time, I will  say vocally
or in the silence oI my heart, “I Ieel liNe loving yoX, bXt I am not going to.”
Similarly, I  may reIXse to taNe on a new patient who is most attractive and
liNely to sXcceed in therapy becaXse my time is already committed to other
patients, some oI  whom  may  be  considerably less  attractive  and more
diIIicXlt.  My  Ieelings oI  love  may be  XnboXnded, bXt my capacity to be
loving is limited.  I thereIore mXst choose the person on whom to IocXs my
capacity to love, toward whom to direct my  will  to love. TrXe love is not a
Ieeling  by  which   we  are overwhelmed.  It   is  a  committed,  thoXghtIXl
decision.
         The common tendency to conIXse love with the Ieeling oI love allows
people all  manner oI  selI-deception. An  alcoholic  man, whose wiIe  and
children are desperately in need oI his attention at that very moment, may
be sitting in a bar with tears in his eyes, telling the bartender, “I really love
my Iamily.”  People who neglect their children in the grossest oI ways more
oIten than not  will   consider themselves the most loving  oI  parents. It  is

92
clear that there may be  a selI-serving TXality in  this  tendency to conIXse
love with  the Ieeling  oI  love; it  is  easy and not at  all Xnpleasant to Iind
evidence oI love in one’s Ieelings. It may be diIIicXlt  and painIXl to search
Ior evidence oI love in one’s actions. BXt becaXse trXe love is an act oI will
that oIten transcends ephemeral Ieelings oI love or cathe[is, it is correct to
say, “Love  is  as love  does.”  Love  and  nonlove, as  good and  evil,  are
obMective and not pXrely sXbMective phenomena.

         The  Work   of   Attention


         Having  looNed at some oI  the  things  that love  is  not, let  Xs now
e[amine some  that love  is.  It  was mentioned in  the  introdXction to  this
section that the deIinition oI love implied eIIort. :hen   we e[tend oXrselves,
when we taNe an e[tra step or walN an e[tra mile, we do so in opposition to
the inertia oI  laziness or the resistance oI Iear.  E[tension oI  oXrselves or
moving oXt against the inertia oI laziness we call worN. Moving  oXt in the
Iace oI Iear  we call  coXrage. Love, then, is a Iorm  oI  worN or a Iorm  oI
coXrage. SpeciIically, it is worN or coXrage directed toward the nXrtXre oI
oXr own or  another’s spiritXal growth.  :e   may worN or  e[ert  coXrage in
directions other than toward spiritXal growth,  and Ior this  reason all worN
and all coXrage is not love. BXt since it reTXires the e[tension oI oXrselves,
love is  always  either worN or  coXrage. II  an act  is  not one  oI  worN or
coXrage, then it is not an act oI love. There are no e[ceptions.
         The principal Iorm  that the worN oI love taNes is attention. :hen  we
love another we give him or  her oXr attention; we attend to that’s person’s
growth. :hen    we love oXrselves we attend to oXr own growth.  :hen   we
attend to  someone we are  caring  Ior  that  person. The act  oI  attending
reTXires that we maNe the eIIort to set aside oXr e[isting preoccXpations (as
was described in regard to the discipline  oI  bracNeting) and actively shiIt
oXr conscioXsness. Attention is an act oI will, oI worN against the inertia oI
oXr own minds. As  Rollo  May says, “:hen    we  analyze will  with  all  the
tools modern psychoanalysis brings Xs, we shall Iind oXrselves pXshed bacN
to the level  oI attention  or intention  as the seat oI will.   The eIIort  which
goes into the e[ercise oI  the will  is  really eIIort  oI  attention; the strain in

93
willing   is  the eIIort   to Neep the  conscioXsness clear, i.e., the  strain oI
Neeping the attention IocXsed.*
         * Love and Will  (New York: Delta Books, Dell Pub., 1969), p. 220

         By Iar the most common and important way in which we can e[ercise
oXr attention  is  by  listening.   :e    spend an  enormoXs amoXnt oI   time
listening, most oI which  we waste, becaXse on the whole most oI Xs listen
very poorly.  An  indXstrial  psychologist once pointed  oXt to  me that  the
amoXnt oI time  we devote to  teaching certain sXbMects to oXr children in
school is inversely  proportional to  the IreTXency with which  the children
will  maNe Xse oI the sXbMect when they grow Xp. ThXs a bXsiness e[ecXtive
will  spend roXghly an hoXr oI his day reading, two hoXrs talNing and eight
hoXrs listening. Yet in  school we  spend a large amoXnt oI  time teaching
children how to  read, a very small  amoXnt oI time  teaching them how to
speaN, and XsXally no time at  all  teaching them how  to  listen. I  do  not
believe it woXld be a good thing  to maNe what we teach in school e[actly
proportional to what we do aIter school, bXt I do thinN we woXld be wise to
give oXr children some instrXction in the process oI listening—not  so that
listening can be made easy bXt rather that they will Xnderstand how diIIicXlt
it is to listen well. Listening well  is an e[ercise oI attention and by necessity
hard worN. It  is becaXse they do not realize this  or  becaXse they are not
willing  to do the worN that most people do not listen well.
         Not very long  ago I attended a lectXre by a IamoXs man on an aspect
oI the relationship between psychology and religion  in  which I  have long
been interested. BecaXse oI my interest I had a certain amoXnt oI e[pertise
in the sXbMect and immediately recognized the lectXrer to be a great sage
indeed. I also sensed love in the tremendoXs eIIort that he was e[erting to
commXnicate, with all  manner oI e[amples,  highly  abstract concepts that
were diIIicXlt  Ior  Xs, his aXdience, to comprehend. I thereIore listened to
him with all the intentness oI which I was capable. ThroXghoXt the hoXr and
a halI  he  talNed sweat was literally   dripping  down  my  Iace in  the  air-
conditioned aXditoriXm. By  the  time  he was  Iinished I  had  a throbbing
headache, the  mXscles  in   my   necN  were   rigid   Irom   my   eIIort   at
concentration, and I  Ielt   completely drained  and e[haXsted.  AlthoXgh I
estimated that I had Xnderstood no more than 50 percent oI what this great
man had said to Xs that aIternoon, I  was amazed by the large  nXmber oI

94
brilliant  insights he had given  me. Following  the lectXre, which was well
attended by  cXltXre-seeNing individXals, I  wandered  aboXt throXgh  the
aXdience dXring a coIIee breaN listening to their comments. Generally they
were disappointed. Knowing his repXtation, they had e[pected more. They
IoXnd him hard to Iollow and his talN conIXsing. He was not as competent a
speaNer as they had hoped to  hear. One woman  proclaimed  to nods  oI
agreement, “He really didn’t tell Xs anything.”
         In contradistinction to the others, I was able to hear mXch oI what this
great man said, precisely becaXse I was willing to do the worN oI listening
to him.  I   was willing   to  do  this worN  Ior  two  reasons: one, becaXse I
recognized his greatness and that what he had to  say woXld liNely  be oI
great valXe; second, becaXse oI my interest in the Iield I deeply wanted to
absorb what he had to  say so as to  enhance my own  Xnderstanding and
spiritXal growth.  My   listening  to  him  was an  act oI  love.  I  loved  him
becaXse I perceived him to be a person oI great valXe worth attending to,
and I loved myselI becaXse I was willing to  worN on behalI oI my growth.
Since he was the teacher and I the pXpil, he the giver and I the receiver, my
love was primarily  selI-directed, motivated by what  I coXld get oXt oI oXr
relationship and  not  what  I  coXld give  him.   Nonetheless, it  is  entirely
possible that  he  coXld  sense within   his  aXdience the  intensity  oI  my
concentration, my  attention,  my  love,   and he  may  have  been thereby
rewarded. Love, as we shall see again and again, is invariably  a two-way
street, a reciprocal phenomenon whereby the receiver  also gives and the
giver also receives.
         From this e[ample  oI  listening in  the receiver role let Xs proceed to
oXr most  common  opportXnity  to  listen  in  the  giver  role:  listening  to
children. The process oI listening to children diIIers depending Xpon the age
oI the child. For the present let Xs consider a si[-year-old Iirst-grader. Given
the chance, a Iirst-grader will talN almost incessantly. How can parents deal
with  this  never-ending chatter? Perhaps the easiest way  is  to  Iorbid  it.
Believe it or  not, there are Iamilies in  which the children  are virtXally not
allowed to  talN, in  which  the  dictXm “Children   shoXld be seen and not
heard” applies twenty-IoXr hoXrs a day. SXch children may be seen, never
interacting, silently staring at adXlts Irom the corners, mXte onlooNers Irom
the shadows. A second way is to permit the chatter bXt simply not listen to
it, so that yoXr child is not interacting with yoX bXt is literally talNing to thin

95
air or to him-or  herselI, creating bacNgroXnd noise that may or may not be
annoying. A third way  is to pretend to listen, proceeding along as best yoX
can with what yoX are doing or with  yoXr train oI thoXght while appearing
to give  the  child  yoXr  attention and occasionally  maNing “Xnh  hXh”  or
“that’s nice”  noises at  more or  less appropriate times in  response to the
monologXe. A IoXrth way is selective listening, which is a particXlarly alert
Iorm oI  pretend listening,  wherein parents may pricN Xp their  ears iI  the
child seems to be saying something oI signiIicance, hoping to separate the
wheat Irom the chaII with a minimXm oI eIIort.  The problem with this way
is  that  the  hXman mind’s  capacity  to   Iilter   selectively  is  not  terribly
competent or eIIicient, with the resXlt that a Iair amoXnt oI chaII is retained
and a great deal oI the wheat lost. The IiIth  and Iinal way, oI  coXrse, is to
trXly listen to the child, giving  him or her yoXr IXll  and complete attention,
weighing each word and Xnderstanding each sentence.
         These Iive ways oI  responding to the  talNing oI children  have been
represented in ascending order oI eIIort, with the  IiIth  way, trXe listening,
reTXiring Irom the parent a  TXantXm leap oI energy compared to the less
eIIortIXl ways. The  reader may naively sXppose that I will  recommend to
parents that they shoXld always Iollow the IiIth way and always trXly listen
to their children. Hardly!  First oI all, the si[-year-old’s  propensity to talN is
so great that a parent who always trXly listened woXld have negligible time
leIt to accomplish anything else. Second, the eIIort reTXired to trXly listen is
so great that the parent woXld be too e[haXsted to accomplish anything else.
Finally, it  woXld be Xnbelievably boring, becaXse the Iact oI the matter is
that the  chatter oI  a  si[-year-old  is  generally  boring.  :hat    is  reTXired,
thereIore, is  a balance oI  all  Iive   ways. It  is  necessary at times  to  tell
children simply to shXt Xp—when, Ior instance, their talN may be distracting
in  sitXations that  critically   reTXire attention  elsewhere or  when it   may
represent a rXde interrXption oI others and an attempt to achieve hostile or
Xnrealistic dominance. FreTXently si[-year-olds will chatter Ior the pXre Moy
oI chattering, and  there is nothing  to be  served by giving  them attention
when they are not even reTXesting it and are TXite clearly happy talNing to
themselves. There are other times when children are not content to talN to
themselves bXt desire to interact with  parents, and yet  their need can be
TXite adeTXately met by pretend listening.  At  these times  what children
want Irom   interaction  is  not  commXnication bXt simply   closeness, and

96
pretend listening will sXIIice to provide them with the sense oI “being with”
that they want. FXrthermore, children themselves oIten liNe to driIt  in and
oXt oI commXnication and will be Xnderstanding oI their parents’ selective
listening, since they are only  selectively commXnicating. They Xnderstand
this to  be  the rXle oI  the  game. So  it  is  only  dXring a  relatively  small
proportion oI their total talNing time that si[-year-old  children need or even
desire a response oI trXe and total  listening. One  oI the  many e[tremely
comple[ tasNs oI parenting is to be able to striNe a close to ideal balance oI
styles oI listening and not listening, responding with the appropriate style to
a child’s varying needs.
         SXch a balance is  IreTXently not  strXcN becaXse, even thoXgh the
dXration need not be long, many parents are Xnwilling or Xnable to e[pend
the energy reTXired Ior trXe listening. Perhaps most parents. They may thinN
they are trXly listening  when all  they are doing  is pretend listening, or  at
best selective listening,  bXt this is  selI-deception, designed to  hide Irom
themselves their laziness. For trXe listening, no matter how brieI,  reTXires
tremendoXs eIIort. First oI  all, it  reTXires total concentration. YoX cannot
trXly listen  to anyone and do  anything else at the  same time. II  a parent
wants to trXly listen  to a child,  the parent mXst pXt aside everything else.
The time oI trXe listening mXst be devoted solely to the child; it mXst be the
child’s time. II  yoX are not willing   to pXt aside everything, inclXding yoXr
own worries and preoccXpations Ior sXch a time, then yoX are not willing to
trXly listen. Second, the eIIort reTXired Ior total concentration on the words
oI  a  si[-year-old   child   is  considerably  greater  than  that  reTXired Ior
listening  to  a  great lectXrer. The  child’s   speech patterns are Xneven—
occasional rXshes oI.  words  interspersed with  paXses and repetitions—
which maNes concentration diIIicXlt. Then the child will  XsXally be talNing
oI matters that  have no inherent interest  Ior the  adXlt, whereas the great
lectXrer’s aXdience is speciIically interested in the  topic oI  his speech. In
other words, it  is  dXll to  listen to  a si[-year-old,   which  maNes it doXbly
diIIicXlt  to  Neep concentration IocXsed. ConseTXently trXly listening to a
child oI this age is a real labor oI love. :ithoXt    love to motivate the parent
it coXldn’t be done.
         BXt why  bother?  :hy    e[ert  all  this  eIIort  to  IocXs totally   on the
boring prattlings oI  a si[-year-old?  First,  yoXr willingness to  do so is  the
best possible concrete evidence oI yoXr esteem yoX can give yoXr child. II

97
yoX give yoXr child the same esteem yoX woXld give a great lectXrer, then
the child  will   Nnow him-or  herselI  to be  valXed and thereIore  will  Ieel
valXable. There is  no better  and Xltimately  no  other way  to  teach yoXr
children that they  are valXable people than by valXing  them. Second, the
more children Ieel valXable, the more they will begin to say things oI valXe.
They will  rise  to yoXr e[pectation  oI  them. Third, the  more yoX listen to
yoXr child,   the more  yoX  will   realize  that in   amongst the  paXses, the
stXtterings, the seemingly innocent  chatter, yoXr child  does indeed  have
valXable things to  say. The  dictXm that  great wisdom  comes Irom  “the
moXths oI babes” is  recognized as an absolXte Iact by anyone who  trXly
listens to children. Listen to yoXr child enoXgh and yoX will come to realize
that  he  or   she  is   TXite  an  e[traordinary   individXal.   And   the  more
e[traordinary yoX realize yoXr child  to be, the more yoX will  be willing  to
listen. And the more yoX will learn. FoXrth, the more yoX Nnow aboXt yoXr
child, the more yoX will  be able to teach. Know  little aboXt yoXr children,
and XsXally yoX will  be teaching things  that either  they are not  ready to
learn or they already Nnow and perhaps Xnderstand better than yoX. Finally,
the more  children  Nnow  that  yoX valXe  them, that  yoX  consider them
e[traordinary  people, the more  willing  they  will   be to  listen to  yoX and
aIIord yoX the same esteem. And the more appropriate yoXr teaching, based
on yoXr Nnowledge oI them, the more eager yoXr children will be to  learn
Irom  yoX. And   the  more they  learn,  the  more  e[traordinary  they  will
become. II the reader senses the cyclical character oI this process, he or she
is TXite correct  and is  appreciating the  trXth  oI  the reciprocity  oI  love.
Instead oI  a  vicioXs downward  cycle,  it  is  a  creative Xpward  cycle  oI
evolXtion and growth. ValXe creates valXe. Love begets love. Parents and
child together spin Iorward Iaster and Iaster in the pas de deu[ oI love.
         :e   have been talNing with  a si[-year-old  in  mind. :ith    yoXnger or
older children the proper balance oI listening  and nonlistening diIIers, bXt
the process is basically the same. :ith yoXnger children the commXnication
is  more and  more  nonverbal  bXt still   ideally  reTXires periods  oI  total
concentration. YoX can’t  play  patty-caNe very  well  when  yoXr  mind  is
elsewhere. And  iI  yoX  can only   play  patty-caNe halIheartedly, yoX are
rXnning the risN oI having a halIhearted child. Adolescent children reTXire
less total listening time Irom their parents than a si[-year-old bXt even more
trXe listening time. They are mXch less liNely to chatter aimlessly, bXt when

98
they do talN, they want their parents’ IXll  attention even more than do the
yoXnger children.
         The need Ior one’s parents to listen is never oXtgrown. A thirty-year-
old talented proIessional man in treatment Ior Ieelings oI an[iety related to
low selI-esteem coXld recall nXmeroXs instances in which his parents, also
proIessionals, had been Xnwilling to  listen  to what  he had to  say or had
regarded what he had to say as being oI little worth and conseTXence. BXt
oI all  these memories the most vivid  and painIXl  was that oI  his twenty-
second year, when he wrote  a lengthy provocative  thesis that earned his
gradXation Irom college  with  high  honors. Being ambitioXs  Ior  him, his
parents were  absolXtely delighted  by  the  honors  he had  received.  Yet
despite the Iact that Ior a whole year he leIt a copy oI  the thesis aroXnd in
IXll view  in the Iamily  living  room  and made IreTXent hints to his parents
that “they might liNe to have a looN at it,” neither one oI them ever tooN the
time to read it. “I  daresay they. woXld have read it,” he said toward the end
oI his therapy, “I daresay they woXld have even complimented me on it had
I  gone to  them  and asNed them point-blanN, ‘LooN,  woXld  yoX please,
please read my thesis? I  want  yoX to  Nnow and appreciate the Ninds oI
things I am thinNing.’  BXt that woXld have been begging them to listen to
me, and I was damned iI at twenty-two  I was going  to go aroXnd begging
Ior their  attention. Having  to beg Ior  it  woXldn’t  have made me Ieel any
more valXable.”
         TrXe  listening,   total   concentration  on   the   other,   is  always   a
maniIestation oI love. An essential part oI trXe listening is the discipline oI
bracNeting, the  temporary   giving   Xp  or   setting  aside  oI   one’s  own
preMXdices, Irames oI reIerence and desires so as to e[perience as Iar as
possible the speaNer’s world Irom  the  inside, stepping  inside his  or  her
shoes. This XniIication oI speaNer and listener is actXally an e[tension and
enlargement oI oXrselI, and  new Nnowledge is  always gained Irom  this.
Moreover, since trXe listening  involves bracNeting, a setting  aside oI the
selI, it also temporarily involves a total acceptance oI the other. Sensing this
acceptance, the speaNer will Ieel less  and less vXlnerable and more  and
more inclined  to  open Xp  the inner  recesses oI his  or  her  mind  to the
listener. As this happens, speaNer and listener begin to appreciate each other
more and more,  and the dXet dance oI  love is  again begXn. The energy
reTXired Ior the discipline oI bracNeting and the IocXsing oI total attention

99
is so great that it can be accomplished only by  love, by the will   to e[tend
oneselI Ior  mXtXal growth.  Most oI  the  time  we lacN this  energy. Even
thoXgh we may Ieel in oXr bXsiness dealings or social relationships that we
are listening very hard, what  we are XsXally doing is listening selectively,
with a preset agenda in mind, wondering as we listen how we can achieve
certain desired resXlts and get  the conversation over  with  as TXicNly as
possible or redirected in ways more satisIactory to Xs.
         Since trXe listening is love in  action, nowhere is it  more appropriate
than  in  marriage.  Yet  most  coXples never  trXly   listen  to   each other.
ConseTXently, when coXples come to Xs Ior coXnseling or therapy, a maMor
tasN we mXst accomplish iI the process is to be sXccessIXl is to teach them
how to listen. Not  inIreTXently we Iail,  the energy and discipline involved
being more  than  they  are  willing   to  e[pend  or  sXbmit  themselves to.
CoXples are oIten sXrprised, even horriIied, when we sXggest to them that
among the things they shoXld do is  talN to each other by  appointment. It
seems rigid and Xnromantic and XnspontaneoXs to them. Yet trXe listening
can occXr only when time is set aside Ior it and conditions are sXpportive oI
it. It cannot occXr when people are driving, or cooNing or tired and an[ioXs
to sleep or easily  interrXpted or in a  hXrry. Romantic “love”  is  eIIortless,
and coXples are IreTXently relXctant to shoXlder the eIIort and discipline oI
trXe love and  listening. BXt  when and  iI  they Iinally   do,  the resXlts are
sXperbly gratiIying. Again and again we have the e[perience oI hearing one
spoXse say to another with real Moy, once the process oI trXe listening has
been started, “:e’ve  been married twenty-nine years and I never Nnew that
aboXt yoX beIore.” :hen   this occXrs we Nnow that growth in the marriage
has begXn.
         :hile     it  is  trXe  that  one’s capacity  to  trXly  listen  may  improve
gradXally with practice, it never becomes an eIIortless process. Perhaps the
primary reTXisite Ior a good psychiatrist is a capacity to trXly listen, yet halI
a dozen times dXring the average “IiIty-minXte  hoXr”  I  will  catch myselI
Iailing to trXly listen to what my patient is saying. Sometimes I may lose the
thread oI my patient’s associations entirely, and it is then necessary Ior me
to say, “I’m sorry, bXt I allowed my mind to wander Ior a moment and I was
not trXly  listening   to yoX.  CoXld  yoX rXn  over  the past  Iew  sentences
again?” Interestingly, patients are XsXally not resentIXl when this occXrs. To
the contrary, they seem to Xnderstand intXitively that a vital element oI the

100
capacity to trXly listen is being on the alert Ior those lapses when one is not
trXly listening,  and my  acNnowledgment that my attention  has wandered
actXally reassXres them that most oI  the  time I  am  trXly  listening.  This
Nnowledge that one is being trXly listened to is  IreTXently in and oI  itselI
remarNably therapeXtic. In appro[imately a  TXarter oI oXr cases, whether
patients   are   adXlts   or   children,    considerable   and   even   dramatic
improvement is shown dXring the Iirst Iew months oI psychotherapy, beIore
any  oI   the   roots  oI   problems   have  been  Xncovered  or   signiIicant
interpretations  have  been  made.  There   are  several  reasons  Ior   this
phenomenon, bXt chieI among them, I believe, is the patient’s sense that he
or she is being trXly listened to, oIten Ior the Iirst time in years, and perhaps
Ior the Iirst time ever.
         :hile    listening is  by Iar the most important  Iorm oI  attention, other
Iorms are  also necessary in  most  loving  relationships, particXlarly  with
children. The variety oI sXch possible Iorms is great. One is game-playing.
:ith   the inIant this will  be patty-caNe and peeNaboo with the si[-year-old it
will  be magic tricNs, go Iish, or  hide-and-seeN; with the twelve-year-old it
will  be badminton and gin rXmmy; and so on. Reading to yoXng children is
attention, as is helping older  ones with their  homeworN. Family activities
are important: movies, picnics, drives, trips, Iairs, carnivals. Some Iorms oI
attention are pXre service to the child: sitting on the beach attending a IoXr-
year-old or the almost endless chaXIIeXring reTXired by early adolescents.
BXt what all these Iorms oI attention have in common—and they have it in
common with  listening as well—is   that they involve  time  spent with  the
child.  Basically, to  attend is  to  spend time  with,  and the  TXality oI  the
attention is proportional to  the intensity oI  concentration dXring that time.
The time spent with children in  these activities, iI Xsed well, gives parents
coXntless opportXnities to observe their children and come to  Nnow them
better. :hether     children  are  good  losers  or   bad,  how  they  do   their
homeworN and how they  learn, what  appeals to them and  what doesn’t,
when they are coXrageoXs and when they are Irightened in sXch activities—
all are vital pieces oI inIormation  Ior  the loving parent. This time with  the
child in  activity  also  gives the parents innXmerable opportXnities Ior  the
teaching oI sNills and the basic principles oI  discipline. The  XseIXlness oI
activity Ior  observing and teaching the child is oI coXrse the basic principle
oI play  therapy, and e[perienced  child  therapists may become e[tremely

101
adept at Xsing the time spent with  their child  patients in  play Ior  maNing
signiIicant observations and therapeXtic interventions.
         Keeping one’s eye on a IoXr-year-old at the beach, concentrating on
an  interminable  disMointed story  told   by   a  si[-year-old,    teaching  an
adolescent how to drive, trXly listening  to the tale oI  yoXr spoXse’s day at
the oIIice or  laXndromat, and Xnderstanding his or her problems Irom the
inside, attempting to be as consistently patient and bracNeting as mXch as
possible—all these are tasNs that are oIten boring, IreTXently inconvenient
and always energy-draining; they mean worN. II we were lazier  we woXld
not do them at all.  II  we were less lazy we  woXld do them more oIten or
better. Since love is worN, the essence oI nonlove is laziness. The sXbMect oI
laziness is  an  e[tremely   important  one. It   is  a  hidden  theme rXnning
throXghoXt the Iirst section on discipline and this one on love. :e will IocXs
it  speciIically   in   the  Iinal    section,  when  we  shoXld  have  a   clearer
perspective.

         The  Risk   of  Loss


         The  act  oI  love—e[tending   oneselI—as  I   have said,  reTXires  a
moving  oXt  against  the   inertia  oI   laziness  (worN)   or  the   resistance
engendered by Iear (coXrage). Let Xs tXrn now Irom the worN oI love to the
coXrage oI  love.  :hen    we  e[tend   oXrselves, oXr selI  enters new  and
XnIamiliar territory, so to speaN. OXr selI becomes a new and diIIerent selI.
:e   do things we are not accXstomed to do. :e  change. The e[perience oI
change, oI XnaccXstomed activity, oI being on XnIamiliar groXnd, oI doing
things diIIerently  is Irightening.  It always was and always will   be. People
handle their Iear oI change in diIIerent ways, bXt the Iear is  inescapable iI
they are in  Iact  to change. CoXrage is not  the  absence oI Iear; it  is  the
maNing oI action  in  spite oI  Iear,  the moving  oXt against the  resistance
engendered by Iear into the XnNnown and into the  IXtXre. On some level
spiritXal growth, and thereIore love, always reTXires coXrage and involves
risN. It is the risNing oI love that we will now consider.
         II yoX are a regXlar chXrchgoer yoX might notice a woman in her late
Iorties who every SXnday e[actly Iive minXtes beIore the start oI the service
inconspicXoXsly taNes the same seat in a side pew on the aisle at the very

102
bacN oI the chXrch.  The moment  the service  is over  she TXietly  bXt TXicNly
maNes Ior  the door   and is  gone  beIore  any  oI  the  other  parishioners  and
beIore  the  minister  can  come  oXt  onto  the  steps to  meet  with   his  IlocN.
ShoXld yoX manage to  accost her—which   is XnliNely—and  invite  her  to the
coIIee  social   hoXr  Iollowing    the  service,  she  woXld   thanN yoX  politely,
nervoXsly  looNing   away  Irom   yoX,  bXt  tell  yoX  that  she  has  a  pressing
engagement, and woXld  then dash away. :ere    yoX to Iollow   her toward  her
pressing engagement yoX woXld  Iind  that she retXrns directly  to her  home, a
little  apartment where  the blinds are always  drawn,  XnlocNs her door, enters,
immediately  locNs the door  behind her, and is  not seen again that SXnday. II
yoX coXld  Neep watch over  her  yoX might   see that she  has a Mob as a low
ranNing  typist    in   a   large   oIIice,   where   she   accepts   her  assignments
wordlessly,  types  them  IaXltlessly,  and  retXrns  her  Iinished  worN  withoXt
comment.  She  eats her  lXnch  at  her desN and  has  no  Iriends.  She  walNs
home,  stopping   always   at  the  same  impersonal   sXpermarNet  Ior  a  Iew
provisions  beIore  she vanishes behind  her  door Xntil  she  appears again Ior
the  ne[t   day’s  worN.  On  SatXrday  aIternoons   she goes  alone  to  a  local
movie theater  that has a weeNly change oI shows.  She has a TV set. She has
no  phone.  She  almost  never  receives  mail.   :ere     yoX  somehow  able  to
commXnicate with   her and comment  that her  liIe  seemed lonely,  she woXld
tell yoX  that she rather enMoyed her loneliness. II  yoX asNed her iI she didn’t
even have any pets, she woXld  tell  yoX that she had  had a dog oI  whom  she
was very   Iond  bXt  that he  had  died  eight  years  beIore  and  no other   dog
coXld taNe his place.
         :ho     is  this woman?  :e    do  not Nnow  the secrets oI  her  heart. :hat
we do  Nnow is  that  her whole  liIe   is devoted  to  avoiding  risNs and  that in
this   endeavor,  rather   than   enlarging    her   selI,   she  has  narrowed    and
diminished   it  almost  to  the  point  oI   none[istence.   She cathects  no  other
living  thing.   Now,  we have  said that  simple  cathe[is   is not  love,  that  love
transcends cathe[is.  This  is trXe, bXt love  reTXires cathe[is  Ior  a beginning.
:e   can  love only   that which  in  one way  or  another  has importance  Ior  Xs.
BXt with  cathe[is   there is  always  the risN oI  loss or  reMection. II yoX  move
oXt to  another  hXman being,  there  is always   the risN  that that  person  will
move  away  Irom   yoX,  leaving   yoX  more  painIXlly   alone  than  yoX  were
beIore. Love  anything   that lives—a   person, a pet,  a plant—and   it  will  die.
TrXst anybody and yoX  may be hXrt; depend on anyone  and that one may  let

103
yoX down. The price oI  cathe[is  is pain. II  someone is determined not to
risN pain, then sXch a person mXst do withoXt many things: having children,
getting married, the ecstasy oI  se[,  the hope oI  ambition, Iriendship—all
that maNes liIe alive, meaningIXl and signiIicant. Move oXt or grow in any
dimension and pain as well as Moy will be yoXr reward. A IXll  liIe  will  be
IXll oI pain. BXt the only alternative is not to live IXlly or not to live at all.
         The essence oI liIe is change, a panoply oI  growth and decay. Elect
liIe and growth,  and yoX elect change and the prospect oI death. A liNely
determinant Ior the  isolated, narrow liIe  oI  the woman  described was an
e[perience or series oI e[periences with  death which she IoXnd so painIXl
that she was determined never to e[perience death again, even at the cost oI
living.  In  avoiding the  e[perience oI  death she had to  avoid growth  and
change. She elected a liIe oI sameness Iree Irom the new, the Xne[pected, a
living death, withoXt risN or challenge. I have said that the attempt to avoid
legitimate sXIIering lies at the root oI all emotional illness. Not sXrprisingly,
most  psychotherapy  patients  (and   probably  most   non-patients,  since
neXrosis is the norm rather  than the e[ception)  have a  problem, whether
they are yoXng or old,  in Iacing  the reality  oI death sTXarely and clearly.
:hat    is sXrprising  is that  the psychiatric  literatXre is  only  beginning  to
e[amine  the signiIicance  oI  this  phenomenon. II   we  can live   with  the
Nnowledge that death is  oXr constant companion,  traveling  on oXr  “leIt
shoXlder,” then death can become in the words oI Don JXan, oXr “ally,” still
Iearsome bXt continXally a soXrce oI wise coXnsel. *
         *  See Carlos Casteneda’s The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way
of Knowledge, A Separate Reality, Journey to Ixtlan,  and Tales of  Power.
2n a major level these are books about the psychotherapeutic process.

         :ith    death’s coXnsel, the constant awareness oI the limit oI oXr time
to live and love, we can always be gXided to maNe the best Xse oI oXr time
and live liIe to the IXllest. BXt iI we are Xnwilling to IXlly  Iace the Iearsome
presence oI death on oXr leIt shoXlder, we deprive oXrselves oI its coXnsel
and cannot possibly  live  or  love with   clarity.  :hen    we shy  away Irom
death, the ever-changing natXre oI things, we inevitably shy away Irom liIe.

         The  Risk   of  Independence

104
         ThXs all liIe itselI represents a risN, and the more lovingly we live oXr
lives the more  risNs we taNe. OI the thoXsands, maybe even millions,  oI
risNs we can  taNe in  a liIetime   the greatest is  the  risN oI  growing  Xp.
Growing Xp is the act oI stepping Irom childhood  into adXlthood. ActXally
it is  more oI  a IearIXl leap than a step, and it  is  a leap that many people
never really taNe in their liIetimes. ThoXgh they may oXtwardly appear to be
adXlts, even sXccessIXl adXlts, perhaps the maMority oI “grown-Xps” remain
Xntil their  death  psychological children  who  have never  trXly  separated
themselves Irom their parents and the power  that their  parents have over
them. Perhaps becaXse it was so poignantly personal to me, I Ieel I can best
illXstrate the essence oI growing Xp and the enormity oI the risN involved by
describing the giant  step I  myselI  tooN into adXlthood at  the end oI  my
IiIteenth  year—IortXnately very  early  in  liIe.   AlthoXgh  this  step was a
conscioXs decision, let me preIace my accoXnt oI it by saying that I had no
awareness whatsoever at the time that what I was doing was growing Xp. I
only Nnew that I was leaping into the XnNnown.
         At  the  age oI  thirteen I  went  away  Irom  home to  Phillips  E[eter
Academy, a boy’s  preparatory school  oI  the  very  highest repXtation, to
which my  brother had gone beIore me. I  Nnew that I was IortXnate to  be
going there, becaXse attendance at E[eter was part oI a well-deIined pattern
that woXld lead me to one oI the  best Ivy LeagXe colleges and Irom there
into the highest echelons oI the Establishment, whose doors woXld be wide
open to  me on  accoXnt oI my  edXcational bacNgroXnd. I Ielt  e[tremely
lXcNy to have been born the child oI  well-to-do  parents who coXld aIIord
“the  best edXcation that money  coXld bXy,”  and I  had a  great sense oI
secXrity which came Irom being a part oI  what was so obvioXsly a proper
pattern. The only problem was that almost immediately aIter starting E[eter
I became miserably Xnhappy. The reasons Ior my Xnhappiness were totally
obscXre to me then and are still TXite proIoXndly mysterioXs to me today. I
MXst did not seem to Iit. I didn’t seem to Iit with the IacXlty, the stXdents, the
coXrses, the architectXre, the social liIe,  the total  environment. Yet there
seemed nothing to do other than to try to maNe the best oI it and try to mold
my imperIections so that I coXld Iit  more comIortably into this  pattern that
had been laid oXt Ior me and that was so obvioXsly the right  pattern. And

105
try  I  did   Ior  two  and  a  halI  years.  Yet daily   my  liIe   appeared more
meaningless and I Ielt more wretched. The last year I did little bXt sleep, Ior
only in sleep coXld I Iind  any comIort. In  retrospect I thinN perhaps in my
sleep I was resting and XnconscioXsly preparing myselI Ior the leap I was
aboXt to taNe. I tooN it when I retXrned home Ior spring vacation oI my third
year and annoXnced that I was not going to retXrn to school. My Iather said,
“BXt  yoX can’t  TXit—it’s  the best edXcation money  can bXy. Don’t  yoX
realize what yoX’d be throwing away?”
         “I  Nnow it’s a good school,” I replied, “bXt I’m not going bacN.”
         “:hy     can’t  yoX adMXst to it, maNe another go oI  it?”   my  parents
asNed.
         “I  don’t Nnow,” I  answered, Ieeling totally inadeTXate. “I don’t even
Nnow why I hate it so. BXt I hate it and I’m not going bacN.”
         “:ell,    what  are yoX going to  do, then? Since yoX seem to  want to
play so loose with yoXr IXtXre, MXst what is it yoX plan to do?”
         Again I miserably replied, “I  don’t Nnow. All  I Nnow is I’m not going
bacN there.”
         My  parents were Xnderstandably alarmed and tooN me Iorthwith to a
psychiatrist, who stated that I was depressed and recommended a month’s
hospitalization, giving  me a day to decide whether or  not this was what  I
wanted. That night was the only time I  ever considered sXicide. Entering a
psychiatric  hospital   seemed TXite  appropriate  to   me.  I   was,  as  the
psychiatrist  said, depressed. My   brother  had  adMXsted to E[eter;  why
coXldn’t I? I Nnew that my diIIicXlty in adMXsting was entirely my IaXlt, and
I Ielt totally  inadeTXate, incompetent and worthless. :orse, I believed that I
was probably insane. Had not my Iather said, “YoX mXst be crazy to throw
away sXch a good edXcation”? II I retXrned to E[eter I woXld be retXrning
to all that was saIe, secXre, right, proper, constrXctive, proven and Nnown.
Yet it was not me, in the depths oI my being I Nnew it was not my path. BXt
what was my  path? II  I  did  not  retXrn, all  that lay  ahead was XnNnown
Xndetermined, XnsaIe, insecXre, XnsanctiIied, Xnpredictable: Anyone who
woXld taNe sXch a path  mXst be  mad. I  was  terriIied.  BXt then,  at  the
moment  oI  my   greatest despair,  Irom  my   XnconscioXs there came  a
seTXence oI words, liNe a strange disembodied oracle Irom a voice that was
not mine: “The  only real secXrity in  liIe  lies in relishing  liIe’s  insecXrity.”
Even iI it meant being crazy and oXt oI step with all that seemed holy, I had

106
decided to be me. I  rested. In  the morning  I went  to see the psychiatrist
again and told him that I woXld never retXrn to E[eter bXt that I was ready
to enter his hospital. I had taNen the leap into the XnNnown. I had taNen my
destiny into my own hands.
         The  process oI   growing  Xp  XsXally occXrs  very  gradXally,  with
mXltiple little  leaps into the XnNnown, sXch as when an eight-year-old boy
Iirst taNes the risN oI riding his biNe down to the coXntry store all by himselI
or a IiIteen-year-old goes oXt on his or her Iirst date. II yoX doXbt that these
represent real risNs, then yoX cannot remember the an[iety involved. II yoX
observe even the healthiest oI children yoX will see not only an eagerness to
risN new and adXlt activities bXt also, side by side, a relXctance, a shrinNing
bacN, a clinging to  the saIe and Iamiliar,  a holding  onto dependency and
childhood. Moreover, on more or less sXbtle levels, yoX can Iind this same
ambivalence in an adXlt,  inclXding yoXrselI, with  the  elderly  particXlarly
tending to cling to  the old, Nnown and Iamiliar. Almost daily  at the age oI
Iorty   I  am   presented with   sXbtle  opportXnities  to   risN  doing  things
diIIerently, opportXnities to grow. I am still growing  Xp, and not as Iast as I
might.  Among  all  the  little   leaps we  might  taNe, there  are also  some
enormoXs ones, as when by leaving school I  was also IorsaNing a whole
pattern oI liIe and valXes according to which I had been raised. Many never
taNe any oI these potential enormoXs leaps, and conseTXently many do not
ever really grow  Xp at all. Despite their  oXtward appearances they remain
psychologically still very mXch the children oI their parents, living by hand-
me-down  valXes, motivated   primarily   by  their   parents’  approval  and
disapproval (even  when their  parents are  long  dead and  bXried), never
having dared to trXly taNe their destiny into their own hands.
         :hile    sXch great leaps are most commonly made dXring adolescence,
they can be made at any age. A thirty-Iive-year-old mother oI three, married
to a controlling, stXltiIying,  inIle[ible,   chaXvinistic hXsband, gradXally and
painIXlly comes to realize that her dependency on him and their marriage is
a living  death. He  blocNs all her  attempts to change the natXre• oI  their
relationship.  :ith     incredible  bravery  she divorces  him,   sXstaining the
bXrden oI his recriminations  and the criticism  oI  neighbors, and risNs an
XnNnown IXtXre alone with her children, bXt Iree Ior the Iirst time in her liIe
to be her own person. Depressed Iollowing a heart attacN, a IiIty-two-year-
old bXsinessman looNs bacN on a liIe oI Irantic ambition to constantly maNe

107
more money and rise  ever higher in  the corporate hierarchy  and Iinds  it
meaningless. AIter long reIlection he realizes that he has been driven by a
need Ior approval Irom  a domineering,  constantly critical  mother; he has
almost worNed himselI to death so as to be Iinally  sXccessIXl in her eyes.
RisNing and transcending her disapproval Ior the  Iirst time  in  his liIe,  as
well  as  braving  the ire   oI  his  high-living   wiIe  and  children,  who  are
relXctant to give Xp their e[pensive liIe  style, he moves to the coXntry and
opens Xp a  little  shop  where he  restores antiTXe IXrnitXre. SXch maMor
changes, sXch   leaps  into    independence  and  selI-determination,   are
enormoXsly painIXl at any age and reTXire sXpreme coXrage, yet they are
not inIreTXent resXlts oI psychotherapy. Indeed, becaXse oI the enormity oI
the   risNs   involved,    they    oIten    reTXire   psychotherapy   Ior    their
accomplishment not  becaXse therapy diminishes the risN  bXt becaXse it
sXpports and teaches coXrage.
         BXt what has this bXsiness oI growing Xp to do with love, apart Irom
the Iact that the e[tension oI the selI involved in loving is an enlargement oI
the selI  into  new dimensions? First  oI  all,  the e[amples  oI  the changes
described and all  other  sXch maMor changes are acts oI  selI-love.  It  is
precisely becaXse I valXed myselI that I was Xnwilling to remain miserable
in a school  and whole social environment  that did not  Iit  my  needs. It is
becaXse the hoXsewiIe had regard Ior herselI that she reIXsed to tolerate any
longer a  marriage that so  totally  limited  her  Ireedom and  repressed her
personality. It is becaXse the bXsinessman cared Ior himselI that he was no
longer willing  to nearly Nill himselI in order to meet the e[pectations oI his
mother. Second, .not only does love Ior oneselI provide the motive Ior sXch
maMor changes; it also is the basis Ior the coXrage to risN them. It is only
becaXse my parents had clearly loved and valXed me as a yoXng child that I
Ielt sXIIiciently  secXre in  myselI to  deIy  their e[pectations  and radically
depart Irom the pattern they had laid oXt Ior me. AlthoXgh I Ielt inadeTXate
and worthless and possibly crazy in doing what I did, I was able to tolerate
these Ieelings only becaXse at the same time, on  an even deeper level, I
sensed myselI to be a good person no matter how diIIerent I  might be. In
daring to  be diIIerent,  even iI  it  meant to  be crazy, I  was responding to
earlier loving  messages Irom my parents, hXndreds oI them,  which  said,
“YoX are a beaXtiIXl and beloved individXal. It is good to  be yoX. :e   will
love yoX no  matter what  yoX do, as long  as yoX are  yoX.” :ithoXt    that

108
secXrity oI my  parents’ love reIlected in  my  own selI-love,  I woXld  have
chosen the Nnown instead oI  the  XnNnown and continXed to Iollow   my
parents’ preIerred pattern at the e[treme cost oI my selI’s basic XniTXeness.
Finally, it  is  only when one  has taNen the leap into the XnNnown oI total
selI-hood, psychological independence and XniTXe individXality that one is
Iree to  proceed along  still  higher  paths oI  spiritXal  growth  and  Iree to
maniIest love in  its greatest dimensions. As long as one marries, enters a
career or has children to satisIy one’s parents or the e[pectations oI anyone
else, inclXding society as a whole, the commitment by its very  natXre will
be a shallow one. As long as one loves ones children primarily becaXse one
is e[pected to behave in a loving manner toward them, then the parent will
be insensitive to the more sXbtle needs oI the children and Xnable to e[press
love in the more sXbtle, yet oIten most important ways. The highest Iorms
oI love are inevitably totally Iree choices and not acts oI conIormity.

         The  Risk   Of   Commitment


         :hether    it  be  shallow or  not,  commitment  is  the IoXndation,  the
bedrocN oI any genXinely loving relationship. Deep commitment does not
gXarantee the sXccess oI the relationship bXt does help more than any other
Iactor to assXre it. Initially shallow commitments may grow deep with time;
iI  not, the relationship  will  liNely  crXmble or else be inevitably  sicNly or
chronically Irail.  FreTXently we are not conscioXsly aware oI the immensity
oI  the  risN  involved   in  maNing  a  deep  commitment.  I   have  already
sXggested that one oI the IXnctions served by the instinctXal phenomenon oI
Ialling   in  love  is   to  provide   the  participants  with  a  magic   cloaN oI
omnipotence which blissIXlly blinds them to the risNiness oI what they are
doing when they  XndertaNe marriage. For my own part I  was reasonably
calm Xntil the very moment that my  wiIe Moined me beIore the altar, when
my whole  body began to tremble. I  then became so Irightened that I  can
remember almost nothing oI  the ceremony or  the reception Iollowing.  In
any case it  is oXr  sense oI commitment  aIter the wedding  which  maNes
possible the transition Irom  Ialling  in  love to  genXine love. And it  is  oXr
commitment aIter  conception  which  transIorms Xs  Irom  biological  into
psychological parents.*

109
         *The    importance   of    the   distinction    between   biological   and
psychological  parenting   is   elegantly   elaborated   and  concretized   in
Goldstein Freud and Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (Macmillan,
1973).

         Commitment is inherent in  any genXine loving relationship. Anyone
who  is   trXly   concerned  Ior   the  spiritXal   growth   oI   another  Nnows
conscioXsly or  instinctively,  that  he or  she can  signiIicantly   Ioster that
growth only  throXgh a relationship oI constancy. Children cannot grow to
psychological matXrity in an atmosphere oI Xnpredictability, haXnted by the
specter oI abandonment. CoXples cannot resolve in any  healthy way  the
Xniversal issXes oI marriage—dependency and independency, dominance
and sXbmission, Ireedom and Iidelity, Ior e[ample—withoXt the secXrity oI
Nnowing that the act oI strXggling over these issXes will not  itselI destroy
the relationship.
         Problems  oI   commitment   are  a   maMor, inherent  part  oI   most
psychiatric disorders, and issXes oI commitment are crXcial in the coXrse oI
psychotherapy. Character-disordered individXals tend to Iorm only shallow
commitments, and when their disorders are severe these individXals seem to
lacN totally the capacity to Iorm commitments at all. It  is not so mXch that
they Iear the risN oI  committing  themselves as that they basically do  not
Xnderstand what commitment is all  aboXt. BecaXse their parents Iailed to
commit themselves to them as children in any meaningIXl way, they  grew
Xp withoXt e[perience oI commitment. Commitment Ior them represents an
abstract beyond  their  Nen, a  phenomenon oI   which  they  cannot  IXlly
conceive. NeXrotics, on the other hand, are generally aware oI the natXre oI
commitment bXt are IreTXently paralyzed by  the Iear  oI  it. UsXally  their
e[perience  oI   early  childhood  \vas  one   in  which   their  parents  were
sXIIiciently  committed to  them Ior  them  to Iorm  a  commitment to  their
parents in  retXrn.  SXbseTXently, however, a cessation oI   parental love
throXgh death, abandonment or chronic reMection, has the eIIect oI maNing
the child’s XnreTXited commitment an e[perience oI intolerable pain. New
commitments, then, are natXrally dreaded. SXch inMXries can be healed only
iI  it   is  possible  Ior   the  person to   have a  basic  and  more  satisIying
e[perience with  commitment  at a later  date. It  is Ior  this  reason, among
others, that   commitment  is   the  cornerstone  oI   the  psychotherapeXtic

110
relationship. There are times when I shXdder at the enormity oI what I am
doing when I accept another patient Ior long-term therapy, For basic healing
to taNe place it is necessary Ior the psychotherapist to bring  to his  or her
relationship  with   a  new  patient  the  same  high  sense  and  degree oI
commitment that  genXinely  loving  parents bring   to  their  children.  The
therapist’s sense oI commitment and constancy oI concern will XsXally be
tested and inevitably made maniIest to the patient in myriad ways over the
coXrse oI months or years oI therapy.
         Rachel, a cold  and distantly proper yoXng woman  oI twenty-seven,
came to see me at the end oI a brieI marriage. Her hXsband, MarN, had leIt
her becaXse oI her Irigidity. “I  Nnow I’m Irigid,”   Rachel acNnowledged. “I
thoXght I woXld warm  Xp to MarN in time,  bXt it never happened. I don’t
thinN it’s MXst MarN. I’ve never enMoyed se[ with anyone. And, to tell yoX
the trXth, I’m not sXre I want to. One part oI  me wants to, becaXse I’d liNe
to have  a happy  marriage someday, and I’d  liNe  to  be normal—normal
people seem to Iind something wonderIXl in se[. BXt another part oI me is
TXite content to stay the way I  am. MarN always said, ‘Rela[  and let go.’
:ell,   maybe I don’t want to rela[ and let go even iI I coXld.”
         In the third  month oI  oXr worN together I pointed oXt to Rachel that
she always said “ThanN yoX” to me at least twice beIore she even sat down
to begin a session—Iirst when I met  her in the waiting  room and again as
she passed throXgh the door into  my  oIIice.  “:hat’s     wrong  with  being
polite?” she asNed.
         “Nothing  per se,”  I replied.  “BXt in  this  particXlar case it seems so
Xnnecessary. YoX are acting as iI yoX were a gXest in here and not even sXre
oI yoXr welcome. “
         “BXt I am a gXest in here. It’s yoXr hoXse.”
         “TrXe,” I  said. “BXt it’s  also trXe that yoX’re paying me Iorty  dollars
an hoXr Ior yoXr time in here. YoX have pXrchased this time and this oIIice
space, and becaXse yoX’ve pXrchased it, yoX have a right to it. YoX’re not a
gXest. This oIIice, this waiting  room, and oXr time together are yoXr right.
It’s  yoXrs. YoX’ve paid  me Ior  this  right,  so why  thanN me  Ior  what is
yoXrs?”
         “I  can’t believe yoX really Ieel that way,” Rachel e[claimed.
         “Then yoX  mXst believe that I  can NicN yoX oXt oI here any time  I
want to,” I  coXntered. “YoX mXst Ieel that it’s possible Ior yoX to come in

111
here some morning and have me tell yoX, ‘Rachel,  worNing with  yoX has
become a bore.  I’ve  decided not  to  see yoX  again. Goodbye and  good
lXcN.’“
         “That’s e[actly  the way I Ieel,”  Rachel agreed. “I’ve never thoXght oI
anything being my  right beIore, at  least not in  regard to any person. YoX
mean yoX coXldn’t NicN me oXt?”
         “Oh,  I   sXppose I  coXld. BXt  I   woXldn’t.  I   woXldn’t  want  to.  It
woXldn’t be  ethical, among other things.  LooN, Rachel,”  I  said, “when  I
taNe on a case sXch as yoXrs in long-term therapy I maNe a commitment to
that case, that person. And I’ve  made a commitment  to yoX. I  will   worN
with yoX as long as is necessary, whether it taNes one year or Iive years or
ten years or whatever. I don’t Nnow whether yoX will TXit oXr worN together
when yoX’re ready or beIore yoX’re ready. BXt whichever it is, yoX are the
one who will   terminate oXr relationship. Short  oI  my death, my  services
will be available to yoX as long as yoX want them.”
         It  was not  diIIicXlt  Ior  me to  Xnderstand Rachel’s problem. At  the
beginning oI  her therapy her e[-hXsband, MarN, had said to  me: “I  thinN
Rachel’s mother has a lot to do with this. She’s a remarNable woman. She’d
maNe a great president oI General Motors, bXt I’m   not sXre she’s a very
good mother.” 4Xite  so. Rachel had been raised, or rather rXled, with  the
Ieeling that  she might be  Iired at  any moment iI   she didn’t  toe the line.
Rather than giving Rachel the sense that her place in the home as a child
was secXre—a sense that  can  come  solely  Irom   committed  parents—
Rachel’s mother had instead consistently commXnicated the opposite: liNe
that oI an employee, Rachel’s position was gXaranteed only insoIar as she
prodXced what was reTXired and behaved according to e[pectations. Since
her place in the home was not secXre as a child, how coXld she Ieel that her
place with me was secXre?
         SXch inMXries caXsed by a parental IailXre oI  commitment  are not
healed by a  Iew  words, a  Iew  sXperIicial reassXrances. On sXccessively
deeper levels they  mXst be worNed throXgh  again and again.  One sXch
worNing-throXgh, Ior instance, occXrred more than a year later. :e had been
IocXsing on the Iact that Rachel never cried in my presence—another way
in which she coXld not allow herselI to “let go.” One day as she was talNing
oI the terrible loneliness that came Irom having to constantly be on gXard, I
sensed that she was on the brinN oI weeping bXt that some slight pXsh was

112
needed Irom me, so I did something oXt oI the ordinary: I  reached over to
where she was lying on the coXch and gently stroNed her head, mXrmXring,
“Poor  Rachel.  Poor  Rachel.”   The  gestXre Iailed.   Rachel immediately
stiIIened and sat  Xp, dry-eyed. “I   cannot do  it,”   she said. “I   cannot let
myselI go.”  This  was toward the  end oI the  session. At her ne[t   session
Rachel came in and sat on the coXch instead oI lying down. “:ell,  now it’s
yoXr time to talN,” she annoXnced.
         “:hat    do yoX mean?” I asNed.
         “YoX’re going to tell me all the things that are wrong with me.”
         I was pXzzled. “I still don’t Xnderstand what yoX mean, Rachel. “
         “This is oXr last session. YoX’re going to sXm Xp all the things wrong
with me, all the reasons why yoX can’t treat me any more.”
         “I  don’t have the Ioggiest idea what’s going on,” I said.
         It was Rachel’s tXrn to be pXzzled. “:ell,”   she said, “last session yoX
wanted me to cry. YoX’ve wanted me to  cry Ior  a long time.  Last session
yoX did everything yoX coXld to help me to cry and I still woXldn’t do it, so
yoX’re going to give Xp on me. I  can’t do what yoX want me to do. That’s
why today will be oXr last session. “
         “YoX really believe I’m going to Iire yoX, don’t yoX, Rachel?”
         “Yes. Anyone woXld.”
         “No,  Rachel, not anyone. YoXr mother might have. BXt I’m not yoXr
mother. Not  everyone in  this world   is liNe  yoXr mother. YoX’re  not my
employee. YoX’re not here to do what I want yoX to do. YoX’re here to do
what yoX want to do it.  I may pXsh yoX, bXt I have no power over yoX.  I
will never Iire yoX. YoX’re here Ior as long as yoX want to be.”
         One  oI  the  problems  that  people commonly   have in   their  adXlt
relationships iI  they  have never received  a Iirm  commitment  Irom  their
parents is  the  “I’ll    desert yoX  beIore  yoX desert  me”  syndrome. This
syndrome will   taNe many  Iorms  or  disgXises. One  Iorm  was  Rachel’s
Irigidity.   AlthoXgh  it   was  never on   a  conscioXs level,  what  Rachel’s
Irigidity  was e[pressing to her hXsband and previoXs boyIriends was, “I’m
not going to give myselI  to yoX when I Nnow damn well that yoX’re going
to dXmp  me one  oI  these days.”  For  Rachel, “letting   go,”   se[Xally  or
otherwise, represented a commitment oI herselI, and she was Xnwilling to
maNe a commitment when the map oI  her past e[perience  made it  seem
certain she woXld not receive any commitment in retXrn.

113
         The “I’ll   desert yoX beIore yoX desert me” syndrome becomes more
and more powerIXl the closer  sXch a person as Rachel comes to another.
AIter a  year oI therapy on  a twice-a-weeN basis Rachel annoXnced to me
that she coXld no longer aIIord eighty dollars a weeN. Since her divorce, she
said, she was having  a diIIicXlt   time maNing ends meet, and  she woXld
simply have to stop  seeing me or cXt bacN to once a weeN. On a realistic
level this  was ridicXloXs. I  Nnew that Rachel  had an inheritance oI  IiIty
thoXsand dollars in addition to the modest salary she earned at her Mob, and
in the commXnity  she was Nnown to be a member oI an old  and wealthy
Iamily. Ordinarily  I woXld have conIronted her vigoroXsly with the Iact that
she coXld aIIord  my   services more easily  than  many patients  and was
clearly Xsing  the issXe oI  money  spXrioXsly to  Ilee  Irom  an increasing
closeness to me.  On  the  other  hand, I  also  Nnew that  her  inheritance
represented something more  Ior  Rachel  than  MXst money; it was  hers,
something  that  woXld   not  desert  her,   a  bXlwarN  oI   secXrity  in   an
Xncommitted world. AlthoXgh it  was TXite reasonable Ior me to asN her to
dip into  her inheritance to pay my  standard Iee, I gXessed that that was a
risN she was not yet ready to maNe and that iI I insisted she woXld indeed
Ilee. She had said she thoXght that on her income she coXld aIIord to pay
IiIty  dollars a weeN, and she oIIered me that amoXnt Ior MXst one session. I
told her I woXld redXce my Iee to twenty-Iive dollars a session and continXe
to see her twice weeNly. She looNed at me with a mi[tXre oI Iear, disbelieI
and Moy. “YoX’d really do  that?”  she asNed. I nodded. A  long period  oI
silence Iollowed. Finally, closer to tears than she had ever yet been, Rachel
said, “BecaXse I came Irom a wealthy Iamily,  the merchants in town have
always charged me the highest the traIIic woXld bear. YoX are oIIering me a
breaN. No one ever oIIered me a breaN beIore.”
         ActXally, Rachel TXit therapy several times dXring the Iollowing year
in the strXggle over whether she coXld permit  oXr mXtXal commitment to
grow. Each time, throXgh a combination oI  letters and phone calls over  a
weeN or two, I was able to persXade her to retXrn. Finally, by the end oI the
second year oI therapy we were able to deal more directly with  the issXes
involved. I’d  learned that Rachel wrote poetry and I asNed her to show it to
me. First  she reIXsed. Then she agreed, bXt weeN aIter weeN she woXld
“Iorget” to bring  it to me. I pointed oXt that withholding her poetry Irom me
had the same signiIicance as withholding her se[Xality Irom MarN and other

114
men. :hy   did  she Ieel that the oIIering  oI her poems to me represented a
total commitment  oI  herselI?  :hy    did  she Ieel  that  the sharing  oI  her
se[Xality was a similar total commitment? Even iI I  were not responsive to
her poetry, woXld that mean a total reMection oI her? :oXld I terminate oXr
Iriendship becaXse she was not a great poet? Perhaps the sharing oI  her
poetry  woXld  deepen oXr  relationship.  :hy     was  she  IearIXl  oI   sXch
deepening? Et cetera. Et cetera. Et cetera.
         Finally  coming  to accept the  Iact that  she did have  a commitment
Irom me,  in the  third  year oI  her therapy Rachel began to  “let  go.”  She
Iinally  tooN the risN oI  letting  me  see her poetry. Then she  was able to
giggle and laXgh and tease. OXr relationship, which  had previoXsly  been
stiII  and Iormal,  became warm, spontaneoXs and oIten light-hearted and
MoyIXl. “I never Nnew what it was  liNe to be rela[ed  with  another person
beIore,” she said. “This  is the Iirst  place in my  liIe  I’ve  ever Ielt secXre.”
From the secXrity oI my oIIice and oXr time together she was rapidly able to
ventXre Iorth into other relationships. She realized that se[ was not a matter
oI commitment  bXt one oI  selI-e[pression  and play  and e[ploration   and
learning  and  MoyIXl abandonment. Knowing   that   I  woXld   always  be
available to her iI she became brXised, liNe the good mother she had never
had, she was Iree to allow her se[Xality to bXrst Iorth. Her Irigidity melted.
By the time she terminated therapy in the IoXrth year, Rachel had become a
vivacioXs and openly passionate person who was bXsily enMoying all that
hXman relationships have to oIIer.
         I   was  IortXnately  able   to  oIIer   Rachel   a  sXIIicient   degree oI
commitment to overcome the ill eIIects oI the lacN oI commitment that she
had never  e[perienced dXring  her  childhood. I   have oIten  been not  so
IortXnate. The compXter technician I  described in  the Iirst  section  as an
e[ample oI transIerence was a case in point. His need Ior commitment Irom
me was so total that I was not able, or willing,  to meet it.  II the therapist’s
commitment is insXIIicient  to  sXrvive the vicissitXdes oI the  relationship,
basic healing will   not  occXr. However, iI   the therapist’s  commitment is
sXIIicient, then XsXally—althoXgh not inevitably—the patient will  respond
sooner or  later  with   a  developing  commitment  oI   his  or  her  own,  a
commitment to the therapist and to  therapy itselI.  The point  at which the
patient begins  to  demonstrate this  commitment  is  the  tXrning point   oI
therapy. For Rachel, I thinN this point came when she Iinally oIIered me her

115
poetry. Strangely, some patients may come to therapy IaithIXlly two or three
hoXrs a weeN Ior years and yet never reach this point. Others may reach it
within the Iirst  Iew months. BXt reach it they mXst iI they are to be healed.
For the therapist it is a wonderIXl moment oI relieI and Moy when this point
is reached, Ior then he or she Nnows that the patient has assXmed the risN oI
commitment to getting well and that thereIore therapy will sXcceed.
         The risN oI commitment to therapy is not only the risN oI commitment
itselI  bXt also the  risN oI  selI-conIrontation and  change. In the  previoXs
section, in  the  discXssion oI the  discipline  oI  dedication  to  the trXth,  I
elaborated on the diIIicXlties oI changing one’s map oI reality, world views
and transIerences. Yet changed they mXst be iI one is to lead a liIe oI loving
involving IreTXent e[tensions oI oneselI into new dimensions and territories
oI  involvement.  There come  many points  on  one’s MoXrney oI spiritXal
growth, whether one is alone or has a psychotherapist as gXide, when one
mXst taNe new and XnIamiliar actions in consonance with one’s new world
view. The taNing oI  sXch new action—behaving diIIerently  Irom the  way
one has always behaved beIore—may represent an e[traordinary personal
risN. The passively homose[Xal yoXng man Ior the Iirst time sXmmons the
initiative to  asN a girl Ior a date; the person who has never trXsted anyone
lies down Ior the Iirst time on the analyst’s coXch allowing the analyst to be
hidden Irom his view; the previoXsly dependent hoXsewiIe annoXnces to her
controlling hXsband that she is obtaining a Mob whether he liNes it or not,
that she has her own  liIe  to  live;  the IiIty-year-old  mama’s boy  tells  his
mother to stop addressing him by  his inIantile  nicNname; the emotionally
distant, seemingly selI-sXIIicient “strong” man Iirst  allows himselI to weep
in pXblic; or Rachel “lets go” and cries Ior the Iirst time  in my oIIice:  these
actions, and  many  more,  involve   a  risN  more  personal and  thereIore
IreTXently more Iearsome and Irightening than that oI any soldier entering
battle. The soldier cannot rXn becaXse the gXn is pointed at his bacN as well
as his Iront. BXt  the individXal  trying to  grow can always  retreat into the
easy and Iamiliar patterns oI a more limited past.
         It has been said that the sXccessIXl psychotherapist mXst bring to the
psychotherapeXtic relationship the same coXrage and the  same sense oI
commitment as the patient. The therapist mXst also risN change. OI all the
good and XseIXl rXles oI psychotherapy that I have been taXght, there are
very Iew that I  have not chosen to breaN at one time or another, not oXt oI

116
laziness and lacN oI discipline bXt rather in Iear and trembling, becaXse my
patient’s therapy seemed to reTXire that, one way or another, I shoXld step
oXt oI the saIety oI  the prescribed analyst’s role, be diIIerent  and risN the
Xnconventional. As I looN bacN on every sXccessIXl case I have had I can
see that at some point or points in each case I had to lay myselI on the line.
The willingness oI  the therapist to  sXIIer at sXch moments is perhaps the
essence oI therapy, and when perceived by the patient, as it XsXally is, it is
always therapeXtic. It is also throXgh this willingness to e[tend themselves
and sXIIer with  and over  their  patients that therapists grow  and change.
Again as I looN bacN on my sXccessIXl cases, there is not one that did not
resXlt in some very meaningIXl, oIten radical,  change in my attitXdes and
perspectives. It has  to be  this  way. It  is  impossible  to  trXly Xnderstand
another withoXt maNing room Ior that person within yoXrselI. This .maNing
room,  which   once  again  is  the  discipline   oI  bracNeting,  reTXires an
e[tension oI and thereIore a changing oI the selI.
         So it is in good parenting as well as in good psychotherapy. The same
bracNeting and e[tension   oI  oXrselves is   involved  in   listening  to  oXr
children. To respond to their healthy needs we mXst change oXrselves. Only
when we  are willing   to Xndergo the  sXIIering oI  sXch changing can we
become the parents oXr children  need Xs to  be.  And  since children  are
constantly growing and their needs are changing, we are obliged to change
and grow with  them. Everyone is Iamiliar  with  parents, Ior instance, who
can deal eIIectively  with  their children  Xntil the time  oI  adolescence, bXt
who then become totally ineIIective  as parents becaXse they are Xnable to
change and adMXst their attitXdes toward  their  now  older  and diIIerent
children. And, as in all other instances oI love, it woXld be incorrect to view
the sXIIering and changing involved in good parenting as some Nind oI selI-
sacriIice or martyrdom; to the contrary, parents have more to gain Irom the
process than their children. Parents who are Xnwilling to risN the sXIIering
oI changing and growing  and learning Irom  their  children are choosing a
path oI senility—whether  they Nnow it or  not—and their children  and the
world will   leave them Iar behind. Learning Irom  their children  is the best
opportXnity most people have to assXre themselves oI a meaningIXl old age.
Sadly, most do not taNe this opportXnity.

117
         The  Risk   of  Confrontation


         The Iinal and possibly the greatest risN oI love is the risN oI e[ercising
power with hXmility. The most common e[ample oI this is the act oI loving
conIrontation. :henever   we conIront someone we are in essence saying to
that person, “YoX are wrong; I am right.” :hen    a parent conIronts a child,
saying, “YoX  are  being  sneaNy,” the  parent is  saying  in  eIIect,  “YoXr
sneaNiness is wrong. I have the right to criticize it becaXse I am not sneaNy
myselI and I am right.” :hen   a hXsband conIronts a wiIe with her Irigidity,
he is saying, “YoX are Irigid, becaXse it is wrong Ior yoX not to respond to
me se[Xally with  greater Iervor, since I am se[Xally  adeTXate and in other
ways all right. YoX have a se[Xal problem; I do not.” :hen a wiIe conIronts
a hXsband with her opinion that he does not spend enoXgh time with her and
the children, she is saying, “YoXr investment in yoXr worN is e[cessive and
wrong. Despite the Iact that I  do not have yoXr Mob, I can see things more
clearly than yoX, and I rightly Nnow that it woXld be more proper Ior yoX to
invest yoXrselI diIIerently.”   The  capacity to  conIront,  to say  “I’m   right,
yoX’re wrong, yoX shoXld be diIIerent,”  is  one that many people have no
diIIicXlty  e[ercising. Parents, spoXses and people in varioXs other roles do
this roXtinely and casXally, leveling criticism  leIt  and right, shooting Irom
the hip. Most sXch criticism and conIrontation, XsXally made impXlsively in
anger or annoyance, does more to increase the amoXnt oI conIXsion in the
world than the amoXnt oI enlightenment.
         For the trXly loving  person the act oI criticism  or conIrontation does
not come easily; to sXch a person it is evident that the act has great potential
Ior arrogance. To conIront one’s beloved is to assXme a position oI moral or
intellectXal sXperiority over the loved one, at least so Iar as the issXe at hand
is  concerned.  Yet  genXine  love   recognizes  and  respects  the  XniTXe
individXality  and separate identity  oI  the other  person. (I  will   say more
aboXt this  later.)  The  trXly  loving  person,  valXing  the XniTXeness and
diIIerentness oI his or  her beloved, will  be relXctant indeed to assXme, “I
am right, yoX are wrong; I Nnow better than yoX what is good Ior yoX.” BXt
the reality oI liIe  is sXch that at times one person does Nnow better than the
other what is good Ior the other, and in actXality is in a position oI sXperior
Nnowledge or  wisdom   in  regard  to  the  matter  at   hand. Under   these

118
circXmstances the wiser  oI  the two   does in  Iact  have an  obligation  to
conIront  the  other  with  the  problem.  The  loving   person, thereIore,  is
IreTXently in a dilemma, caXght between a loving respect Ior the beloved’s
own path in liIe and a responsibility to e[ercise  loving leadership when the
beloved appears to need sXch leadership. The dilemma can be resolved only
by painstaNing selI-scrXtiny, in  which  the lover  e[amines stringently  the
worth oI  his or her “wisdom”  and the motives behind this  need to assXme
leadership. “Do  I  really  see things  clearly  or am  I  operating on  mXrNy
assXmptions? Do I really Xnderstand my beloved? CoXld it not be that the
path my beloved is taNing is wise and that my perception oI it as Xnwise is
the resXlt oI limited vision on my part? Am I being selI-serving in believing
that my  beloved needs redirection?” These are  TXestions that those who
trXly love mXst continXally asN themselves. This selI-scrXtiny, as obMective
as possible, is the  essence oI hXmility  or  meeNness. In the words oI  an
anonymoXs  IoXrteenth-centXry  British    monN   and   spiritXal    teacher,
“MeeNness in itselI is  nothing  else than a trXe Nnowing and Ieeling  oI  a
man’s selI as he is. Any man who trXly sees and Ieels himselI as he is mXst
sXrely be meeN indeed.”*
         *  The  Cloud  of Unknowing,   trans. Ira  Progoff  (New  York:  Julian
Press, 1969), p. 92.

         There are,  then, two  ways  to  conIront or  criticize   another hXman
being: with instinctive and spontaneoXs certainty that one is right, or with a
belieI that one is probably right arrived at throXgh scrXpXloXs selI-doXbting
and selI-e[amination.  The  Iirst  is  the  way  oI  arrogance; it  is  the  most
common way  oI parents, spoXses, teachers and people generally in their
day-to-day aIIairs;  it  is XsXally XnsXccessIXl, prodXcing more resentment
than growth and other eIIects that were not intended. The second is the way
oI hXmility;  it  is not common, reTXiring as it  does a genXine e[tension oI
oneselI; it is more liNely to be sXccessIXl, and it is never, in my e[perience,
destrXctive.
         There are a signiIicant nXmber oI individXals who  Ior one reason or
another have learned to  inhibit   their  instinctive  tendency to  criticize  or
conIront with  spontaneoXs arrogance bXt who go no Iarther, hiding in the
moral saIety oI meeNness, never daring to assXme power. One sXch was a
minister and  Iather oI  a  middle-aged patient  who  was sXIIering Irom   a

119
liIelong  depressive neXrosis. My  patient’s mother  was an  angry, violent
woman  who  dominated  the  hoXsehold with   her  temper  tantrXms and
manipXlations and not inIreTXently beat her hXsband physically in Iront oI
the daXghter. The minister never IoXght bacN and coXnseled his daXghter
also to respond to her mother by tXrning the other cheeN and, in the name oI
Christian charity, being  Xnendingly sXbmissive and respectIXl. :hen   she
began therapy   my   patient  revered  her   Iather  Ior   his   mildness  and
“lovingness.” It was not very long, however, beIore she came to realize that
his meeNness was weaNness, and that in his passivity he had deprived her oI
adeTXate parenting every bit as mXch as her mother had with her mean selI-
centeredness. She Iinally saw that he had done nothing to protect her Irom
her mother’s evil and nothing, in Iact, to conIront evil, leaving her no option
bXt to  incorporate  her  mother’s  bitter  manipXlativeness along with   his
pseXdohXmility as role models. To Iail  to  conIront when  conIrontation is
reTXired Ior  the nXrtXre oI  spiritXal  growth  represents a IailXre  to love
eTXally as does thoXghtless criticism or condemnation and other Iorms oI
active  deprivation  oI  caring.  II   they  love  their  children   parents mXst,
sparingly  and careIXlly  perhaps  bXt nonetheless actively,  conIront   and
criticize them Irom  time  to time, MXst as they mXst allow their children to
conIront and criticize  themselves in  tXrn. Similarly,  loving  spoXses mXst
repeatedly conIront each other iI  the marriage relationship is  to serve the
IXnction oI promoting the spiritXal growth oI the partners. No marriage can
be MXdged trXly sXccessIXl Xnless hXsband and wiIe are each other’s best
critics. The  same holds trXe Ior Iriendship.  There is a  traditional concept
that Iriendship  shoXld be a  conIlict-Iree  relationship, a  “yoX  scratch my
bacN, I’ll scratch yoXrs” arrangement, relying solely on a mXtXal e[change
oI   Iavors   and  compliments   as  prescribed  by   good   manners.  SXch
relationships are sXperIicial and intimacy-avoiding and do not  deserve the
name oI Iriendship  which  is  so commonly  applied to  them. FortXnately,
there are signs that oXr concept oI Iriendship is beginning to deepen. MXtXal
loving conIrontation  is a signiIicant  part oI  all  sXccessIXl and meaningIXl
hXman relationships. :ithoXt   it  the  relationship is  either XnsXccessIXl or
shallow.
         To conIront or  criticize  is a Iorm  oI e[ercising  leadership or power.
The e[ercise oI power is nothing  more and nothing less than an attempt to
inIlXence the coXrse oI events, hXman or otherwise, by one’s actions in a

120
conscioXsly or XnconscioXsly predetermined manner. :hen we conIront or
criticize someone it is becaXse we want to change the coXrse oI the person’s
liIe.  It   is  obvioXs  that  there are  many  other,  oIten  sXperior, ways  to
inIlXence the  coXrse oI   events than  by   conIrontation  or  criticism:   by
e[ample,   sXggestion,  parable,   reward  and   pXnishment,   TXestioning,
prohibition or  permission, creation oI e[periences, organizing with  others,
and so on. VolXmes can be written aboXt the art oI e[ercising  power. For
oXr pXrposes, however, sXIIice it to say that loving individXals mXst concern
themselves with this  art,  Ior  iI  one desires to  nXrtXre another’s spiritXal
growth, then  one mXst  concern oneselI with   the most  eIIective  way  to
accomplish this in  any given instance. Loving  parents, Ior e[ample,  mXst
Iirst  e[amine  themselves and their valXes stringently  beIore determining
accXrately that they Nnow what is best Ior their  child. Then, having  made
this determination,  they also  have to  give greater thoXght  to the  child’s
character and capacities beIore deciding whether the child woXld be more
liNely to  respond Iavorably  to  conIrontation  than to  praise  or increased
attention or  storytelling   or  some other  Iorm   oI  inIlXence.  To conIront
someone with something he or she cannot handle will at best be a waste oI
time, and liNely will   have a deleterioXs eIIect. II we  want to be heard we
mXst speaN in a langXage the listener can Xnderstand and on a level at which
the listener  is  capable oI  operating. II   we  are to  love  we  mXst e[tend
oXrselves to adMXst oXr commXnication to the capacities oI oXr beloved.
         It  is clear  that e[ercising  power  with  love reTXires a great deal  oI
worN, bXt what is this aboXt the risN involved? The problem is that the more
loving one is, the more hXmble one is; yet the more hXmble one is, the more
one is awed by the potential Ior arrogance in e[ercising power. :ho am I to
inIlXence the coXrse oI hXman events? By what aXthority am I entitled  to
decide what is best Ior  my child,  spoXse, my coXntry or the hXman race?
:ho   gives  me the right  to dare to  believe in  my own  Xnderstanding and
then to presXme to e[ert my will  Xpon the world? :ho    am I to play  God?
That is  the risN. For  whenever we  e[ercise  power we  are attempting to
inIlXence the coXrse oI the world, oI hXmanity, and we are thereby playing
God. Most  parents, teachers, leaders—most oI Xs who e[ercise  power—
have no cognizance oI this, In  the arrogance oI e[ercising  power withoXt
the  total   selI-awareness  demanded  by   love,   we   are   blissIXlly   bXt
destrXctively ignorant oI the Iact  that we are playing  God. BXt those who

121
trXly love, and thereIore worN Ior the wisdom that love reTXires, Nnow that
to act is to play God. Yet they also Nnow that there is no alternative e[cept
inaction   and  impotence.  Love    compels  Xs  to   play   God   with    IXll
conscioXsness oI the enormity oI the Iact that that is MXst what we are doing.
:ith    this  conscioXsness the loving person assXmes the responsibility oI
attempting to be God and not to  carelessly play God, to IXlIill   God’s will
withoXt mistaNe. :e   arrive, then, at  yet another parado[:  only  oXt oI the
hXmility oI love can hXmans dare to be God.

         LoYe  Is  Disciplined


         I have indicated that the energy Ior the worN oI selI-discipline derives
Irom  love, which  is  a Iorm  oI  will.   It  Iollows,  then,  not only  that  selI-
discipline is XsXally love, translated into action,  bXt also that any genXine
lover behaves with selI-discipline and any genXinely loving relationship is a
disciplined relationship. II  I  trXly  love another, I will   obvioXsly order my
behavior in sXch a way  as to contribXte the Xtmost to his  or her spiritXal
growth. A  yoXng, intelligent, artistic and “bohemian”  coXple with whom  I
once attempted to worN had a IoXr-year marriage marNed by almost daily
screaming, dish-throwing  and Iace-clawing  TXarrels, along  with  weeNly
casXal inIidelity and monthly separations. Shortly aIter we began oXr worN
they  each  correctly   perceived  that  therapy  woXld   lead  them  toward
increasing selI-discipline, and conseTXently to a less disorderly relationship.
“BXt yoX want to taNe the passion oXt oI oXr relationship,” they said. “YoXr
notions  oI   love   and  marriage  leave  no   room  Ior   passion.”   Almost
immediately thereaIter they TXit therapy, and it has been reported to me that
three years  later,  aIter  several boXts  with   other  therapists, their  daily
screaming matches and  the  chaotic  pattern  oI  their  marriage  continXe
Xnchanged, as well as the XnprodXctivity oI their individXal lives. There is
no doXbt that their Xnion is, in a certain sense, a highly colorIXl one. BXt it
is liNe the primary colors in the paintings oI children, splashed on the paper
with abandon, occasionally not withoXt charm, bXt generally demonstrating
the sameness that characterizes the art oI  yoXng children. In  the  mXted,
controlled hXes oI Rembrandt one can  Iind the  color, yet  inIinitely  more
richness, XniTXeness and meaning. Passion is Ieeling oI great depth. The

122
Iact that a Ieeling is Xncontrolled is no indication  whatsoever that it is any
deeper than a Ieeling that is disciplined. To the contrary, psychiatrists Nnow
well  the trXth oI  the old  proverbs “Shallow  brooNs are noisy”  and “Still
waters rXn deep.” :e    mXst not assXme that someone whose Ieelings are
modXlated and controlled is not a passionate person.
         :hile    one shoXld not be a slave to one’s Ieelings, selI-discipline does
not mean the sTXashing oI one’s Ieelings into none[istence. I IreTXently tell
my patients  that their  Ieelings  are their  slaves and  that the  art  oI  selI-
discipline is liNe the art oI slave-owning. First oI  all, one’s Ieelings are the
soXrce oI one’s energy; they provide the horsepower, or slave power, that
maNes it possible Ior Xs to accomplish the tasNs oI living. Since they worN
Ior Xs, we shoXld treat them with respect. There are two common mistaNes
that slave-owners can maNe which represent opposite and e[treme Iorms oI
e[ecXtive  leadership. One  type  oI  slave-owner  does not  discipline   his
slaves, gives them no strXctXre, sets them no limits, provides them with no
direction and does not  maNe it clear  who is  the boss. :hat    happens, oI
coXrse, is that in dXe time his slaves stop worNing and begin moving into
the mansion, raiding the liTXor cabinet and breaNing the IXrnitXre, and soon
the slave-owner Iinds that he is the slave oI  his slaves, living  in the same
Nind oI   chaos as  the  aIorementioned  character-disordered “bohemian”
coXple.
         Yet the opposite style oI leadership, which the gXilt-ridden neXrotic so
oIten e[erts  over his Ieelings,  is eTXally selI-destrXctive. In this  style the
slave-owner is so obsessed with the Iear that his slaves (Ieelings) might get
oXt oI control and so determined that they shoXld caXse him no troXble that
he roXtinely beats them into sXbmission and pXnishes them severely at the
Iirst sign oI  any potency. The resXlt oI this  style is that in  relatively  short
order the slaves become less and less prodXctive as their will is sapped by
the harsh treatment they receive. Or  else their will   tXrns more and more
toward covert rebellion. II the process is carried oXt long enoXgh, one night
the owner’s prediction  Iinally  comes trXe and the slaves rise Xp and bXm
down the mansion, IreTXently with the owner inside. SXch is the genesis oI
certain psychoses and overwhelming neXroses. The proper management oI
one’s Ieelings clearly  lies  along a  comple[  (and thereIore not  simple  or
easy) balanced middle path,  reTXiring constant MXdgment and continXing
adMXstment. Here the owner  treats  his  Ieelings   (slaves)  with  respect,

123
nXrtXring them with   good Iood,  shelter and  medical  care, listening  and
responding to their voices, encoXraging them, inTXiring as to their  health,
yet also organizing  them, limiting   them, deciding  clearly  between them,
redirecting them and teaching them,  all the  while leaving  no doXbt as to
who is the boss. This is the path oI healthy selI-discipline.
         Among the Ieelings that mXst be so disciplined is the Ieeling oI love.
As  I  have  indicated, this  is  not  in   itselI  genXine love  bXt  the Ieeling
associated with cathe[is. It  is to be very  mXch respected and nXrtXred Ior
the creative energy it brings, bXt iI  it is  allowed to rXn rampant, the resXlt
will  not be genXine love bXt conIXsion and XnprodXctivity. BecaXse genXine
love involves an e[tension oI  oneselI, vast amoXnts oI energy are reTXired
and, liNe it or not, the store oI oXr energy is as limited  as the hoXrs oI oXr
day. :e  simply  cannot love everyone. TrXe, we may have a Ieeling oI love
Ior  manNind, and this  Ieeling  may  also be  XseIXl in  providing  Xs with
enoXgh energy to maniIest genXine love Ior a Iew speciIic individXals. BXt
genXine love Ior a relatively Iew individXals is all  that is within  oXr power.
To attempt to e[ceed the limits  oI oXr energy is to oIIer more than we can
deliver, and there is a point oI no retXrn beyond which an attempt to love all
comers becomes IraXdXlent and harmIXl to the very ones we desire to assist.
ConseTXently iI we are IortXnate enoXgh to be in a position in which many
people asN Ior oXr attention, we mXst choose those among them whom we
are actXally to  love.  This  choice  is  not  easy; it  may  be  e[crXciatingly
painIXl, as the  assXmption oI godliNe power  so oIten  is. BXt  it  mXst be
made. Many  Iactors need to  be  considered, primarily  the  capacity oI  a
prospective recipient  oI  oXr love  to  respond to  that  love  with  spiritXal
growth. People diIIer in this capacity, a Iact to which more e[amination will
later be given.  It  is, however, XnTXestionable that there are many whose
spirits are so locNed in  behind impenetrable armor that  even the greatest
eIIorts to nXrtXre the growth oI  those spirits are doomed to almost certain
IailXre. To attempt to love someone who cannot beneIit Irom yoXr love with
spiritXal growth is to waste yoXr energy, to cast yoXr seed Xpon arid groXnd.
GenXine love is precioXs, and those who are capable oI genXine love Nnow
that their loving  mXst be IocXsed as prodXctively as possible throXgh selI-
discipline.
         The converse oI the problem oI loving too many people also needs to
be e[amined. It is possible Ior some people, at least, to love more than one

124
person at the same time, to simXltaneoXsly maintain a nXmber oI genXinely
loving relationships. This itselI is a problem Ior several reasons. One reason
is the American or :estern  myth oI romantic love  that sXggests that certain
people are “meant  Ior  each other”;  thXs, by  e[trapolation,   they are  not
meant Ior  anyone  else. The  myth,  thereIore,  prescribes e[clXsivity   Ior
loving relationships, most  particXlarly se[Xal  e[clXsivity.  On balance, the
myth is probably helpIXl in contribXting  to the stability and prodXctivity oI
hXman relationships,   since  the   vast  maMority  oI   hXman  beings  are
challenged to the limit  oI their  capacities to e[tend themselves to develop
genXinely loving   relationships  with   their   spoXses and children   alone.
Indeed, iI one can say that one has bXilt genXinely loving relationships with
a spoXse and children, then one has already sXcceeded in accomplishing
more than  most  people  accomplish  in  a  liIetime.   There  is  IreTXently
something pathetic aboXt the individXal who has Iailed to bXild his Iamily
into a loving Xnit, yet restlessly searches Ior loving relationships oXtside the
Iamily. The Iirst  obligation oI  a genXinely loving person will  always be to
his or her  marital and parental relationships. Nonetheless, there are some
whose  capacity  to   love   is   great  enoXgh  Ior   them  to   bXild   loving
relationships sXccessIXlly within the Iamily   and still  have energy leIt  Ior
additional  relationships. For  these  the myth   oI  e[clXsivity   is  not  only
patently Ialse,  bXt also  represents an Xnnecessary limitation  Xpon their
capacity to give oI  themselves to others oXtside their Iamily. It is possible
Ior this limitation  to be overcome, bXt great selI-discipline is reTXired in the
e[tension oI oneselI in order to avoid “spreading oneselI too thin.” It was to
this  e[traordinarily   comple[   issXe (here  toXched only  in  passing)  that
Joseph Fletcher,  the  Episcopalian  theologian  and  aXthor oI   The  NeZ
Morality,  was addressing himselI  when he reportedly  said to  a Iriend  oI
mine, “Free love is an ideal. UnIortXnately, it is an ideal oI which very Iew
oI Xs are capable.” :hat  he meant was that very Iew oI Xs have a capacity
Ior selI-discipline  great enoXgh to maintain constrXctive relationships that
are genXinely loving   both  inside  and oXtside  the Iamily.   Freedom and
discipline are indeed handmaidens; withoXt the discipline oI genXine love,
Ireedom is invariably nonloving and destrXctive.
         By  this  time  some readers may  Ieel  satXrated by  the  concept oI
discipline and conclXde that I  am advocating a style oI  liIe  oI Calvinistic
dreariness. Constant  selI-discipline!    Constant  selI-e[amination!   DXty!

125
Responsibility! NeopXritanism, they  might  call  it.  Call  it  what  yoX will,
genXine love, with all the discipline that it  reTXires, is the only path in this
liIe to sXbstantial Moy. TaNe another path and yoX may Iind rare moments oI
ecstatic Moy, bXt they will be Ileeting and progressively more elXsive. :hen
I genXinely love I am e[tending  myselI, and when I am e[tending myselI  I
am growing.  The  more  I  love,  the longer  I  love,  the  larger  I  become.
GenXine love is selI-replenishing. The more I nXrtXre the spiritXal growth oI
others, the more my own spiritXal growth is nXrtXred. I am a totally selIish
hXman being. I never do something Ior somebody else bXt that I do  it Ior
myselI. And as I  grow throXgh love, so grows  my Moy, ever more present,
ever more constant. NeopXritan perhaps I am. I am also a Moy IreaN. As John
Denver sings:

                Love  is everywhere, I see it.
                YoX are all that yoX can be, go on and be it.
                LiIe  is perIect, I believe it.
                Come and play the game with me. *

         LoYe  Is  Separateness


         AlthoXgh the act oI nXrtXring another’s spiritXal growth has the eIIect
oI nXrtXring one’s own,  a maMor characteristic oI genXine love is that the
distinction  between  oneselI  and  the   other  is   always  maintained  and
preserved. The genXine lover always perceives the beloved as someone who
has a totally separate identity. Moreover, the genXine lover always respects
and even encoXrages this separateness and the XniTXe individXality oI the
beloved. FailXre  to  perceive and  respect this  separateness is e[tremely
common, however, and the caXse oI mXch mental illness and Xnnecessary
sXIIering.
         In its  most e[treme  Iorm  the IailXre to  perceive the separateness oI
the other is called narcissism. FranNly narcissistic individXals are actXally
Xnable to perceive their children, spoXses or Iriends as being separate Irom

126
themselves on an emotional level. The Iirst time I began to Xnderstand what
narcissism is  all  aboXt was  dXring  an interview   with  the  parents oI  a
schizophrenic patient whom  I  will   call SXsan ;.   SXsan at the  time was
thirty-one. Since  the age oI  eighteen she had made a nXmber oI  serioXs
sXicide attempts, and had had to  be hospitalized almost  continXally in  a
variety oI hospitals and sanatoria Ior the previoXs thirteen years. However,
largely becaXse oI sXperior psychiatric care that she had received Irom other
psychiatrists dXring these years she was Iinally beginning to improve. For
some months dXring oXr worN together she had demonstrated an increasing
capacity to trXst trXstworthy people, to distingXish between trXstworthy and
XntrXstworthy people, to accept the Iact that she had a schizophrenic illness
and woXld need to e[ert a great deal oI selI-discipline Ior the rest oI her liIe
to deal with this illness, to respect herselI, and to do what was necessary to
care Ior herselI withoXt having to rely on others to continXally nXrtXre her.
BecaXse oI this great progress I Ielt  the moment was soon at hand when
SXsan woXld be able to leave the hospital and Ior the Iirst time in  her liIe
lead and maintain a sXccessIXl independent e[istence. It was at this point
that I met with her parents, an attractive, wealthy coXple in their mid-IiIties.
I  was very  happy  to  describe to  them  SXsan’s enormoXs progress and
e[plain  in detail  the reasons Ior my  optimism.  BXt mXch to my  sXrprise,
soon aIter I  began to  do this,  SXsan’s mother started to cry  silently  and
continXed to cry as I went on with  my hopeIXl message. At Iirst I  thoXght
perhaps her tears were tears oI Moy, bXt it was clear Irom her e[pression that
she was indeed Ieeling sad. Finally I said, “I’m  pXzzled, Mrs. ;.  I’ve  been
telling yoX things today  that are most hopeIXl, yet yoX seem to be Ieeling
sad.”
         “OI  coXrse I’m  sad,”  she replied. “I   MXst can’t help crying when I
thinN oI all poor SXsan has to sXIIer.”
         I then went into  a lengthy e[planation  to the eIIect that while  it  was
TXite trXe SXsan had sXIIered a good deal in the coXrse oI her illness, she
had also clearly learned a good deal Irom this  sXIIering, had come oXt on
top oI it and, in my estimation, was XnliNely to sXIIer any more in the IXtXre
than any other adXlt. Indeed, she might sXIIer considerably less than any oI
Xs  becaXse oI   the   wisdom   she  had   gained  Irom    her  battle   with
schizophrenia. Mrs. ;. continXed to weep silently.

127
         “FranNly, I’m  still  pXzzled, Mrs. ;.,”    I said. “Over  the past thirteen
years yoX mXst have participated in at least a dozen conIerences liNe this
with  SXsan’s psychiatrists, and Irom what  I  Nnow, none oI  them was as
optimistic as this one. Don’t yoX Ieel gladness as well as sadness?”
         “I  can only thinN oI  how diIIicXlt  liIe  is Ior  SXsan,” Mrs. ;.   replied
tearIXlly.
         “LooN, Mrs.  ;.,”   I  said, “is  there anything I coXld say to  yoX aboXt
SXsan that woXld maNe yoX Ieel encoXraged and happy aboXt her?”
         “Poor SXsan’s liIe is so IXll oI pain,” Mrs. ;.  whimpered.
         SXddenly I realized  that Mrs.  ;.   was  not crying  Ior  SXsan bXt Ior
herselI. She was crying Ior her own pain and sXIIering. Yet the conIerence
was aboXt SXsan, not aboXt her, and she was doing her crying in SXsan’s
name. How coXld she do this, I wondered. And then I realized that Mrs. ;.
was actXally not able to distingXish between SXsan and herselI. :hat   she
Ielt, SXsan mXst Ieel. She was Xsing SXsan as a vehicle to e[press her own
needs. She was not doing this conscioXsly or malicioXsly; on an emotional
level she coXld not, in  Iact perceive SXsan as having an identity  separate
Irom her  own. SXsan was she. In  her mind  SXsan as a XniTXe, diIIerent
individXal with  a XniTXe, diIIerent path in  liIe  simply  did  not e[ist—nor,
probably, did  anyone else.  IntellectXally  Mrs.  ;.    coXld recognize other
people as being diIIerent  Irom  herselI.  BXt on  a more  basic level  other
people did not e[ist  Ior  her. In  the depths oI her mind  the entirety  oI the
world was she, Mrs. ;., she alone.
         In   sXbseTXent e[periences  I   IreTXently  IoXnd   the   mothers  oI
schizophrenic children  to  be  e[traordinarily   narcissistic individXals  liNe
Mrs. ;.   This is not  to say that sXch mothers are always narcissistic or that
narcissistic mothers can’t raise non-schizophrenic children. Schizophrenia
is  an  e[tremely    comple[   disorder,  with   obvioXs  genetic  as  well   as
environmental determinants. BXt one can imagine the depth oI conIXsion in
SXsan’s childhood  prodXced by  her  mother’s  narcissism, and  one  can
obMectively see this conIXsion when actXally observing narcissistic mothers
interact with their children. On an aIternoon when Mrs. ;. was Ieeling sorry
Ior herselI SXsan might have come home Irom school bringing some oI her
paintings the teacher had graded A. II she told her mother proXdly how she
was progressing in an, Mrs. ;.  might  well respond: “SXsan, go taNe a nap.
YoX shoXldn’t get  yoXrselI so e[haXsted over  yoXr worN in  school.  The

128
school system is no good anymore. They don’t care Ior children anymore.”
On the other hand, on an aIternoon when  Mrs. ;.   was in  a very  cheerIXl
mood SXsan might have come home in tears over the Iact that she had been
bXllied by several boys on the school .; .; bXs, and Mrs. ;. coXld say: “Isn’t
it IortXnate that  Mr.  Jones is sXch a good bXs driver? He  is so  nice and
patient with all yoX children and yoXr roXghhoXsing. I thinN yoX shoXld be
sXre to give him a nice little  present at Christmastime.” Since they do not
perceive others as others bXt only as e[tensions oI themselves, narcissistic
individXals lacN the capacity Ior empathy, which is the capacity to Ieel what
another is  Ieeling. LacNing empathy, narcissistic parents XsXally respond
inappropriately to their children on an emotional level and Iail  to oIIer  any
recognition or veriIication oI  their children’s Ieelings. It is no wonder, then,
that sXch children grow Xp with grave diIIicXlties in recognizing, accepting
and hence managing their own Ieelings.
         :hile    not  XsXally as narcissistic  as Mrs.  ;.,    the vast  maMority oI
parents Iail in some degree to adeTXately recognize or IXlly appreciate the
XniTXe individXality or  “otherness” oI  their  children.  Common e[amples
aboXnd. Parents will say oI a child, “He’s a chip  oII the old  blocN” or to a
child,  “YoX’re  MXst liNe yoXr Uncle Jim,”  as  iI  their  children  are some
genetic copy   oI  themselves or   the  Iamily,  when  the  Iacts  oI   genetic
combinations are sXch that all children genetically are e[tremely  diIIerent
Irom either oI their  parents and all oI their Iorebears. Athletic Iathers pXsh
their scholarly  sons into Iootball  and scholarly  Iathers pXsh their athletic
sons into booNs, caXsing the sons mXch Xnnecessary gXilt and tXrmoil. A
general’s wiIe  complains aboXt her  seventeen-year-old daXghter: “:hen
she’s home, Sally  sits  in  her room  all  the  time  writing  sad poetry.  It’s
morbid, Doctor. And she absolXtely reIXses to have a coming-oXt party. I’m
aIraid that  she’s serioXsly ill.”   AIter  interviewing  Sally,  a charming  and
vivacioXs yoXng woman who is on the honor roll at school and has lots oI
Iriends, I tell  her parents that I thinN Sally is perIectly healthy and sXggest
that perhaps they shoXld lessen their pressXre on her to be a carbon copy oI
themselves. They leave to looN Ior another psychiatrist, one who might be
willing  to pronoXnce Sally’s diIIerences deviancies.
         Adolescents IreTXently complain that they are disciplined not oXt oI
genXine concern bXt  becaXse oI parental Iear  that  they  will   give  their
parents a bad image. “My parents are continXally aIter me to cXt my hair,”

129
adolescent boys Xsed to say a Iew years ago. “They can’t e[plain why long
hair is  bad Ior me.  They MXst don’t want other people to see they’ve  got
long-haired Nids. They don’t really give a shit aboXt me. All they are really
caring aboXt is their  own  image.”  SXch adolescent resentment is XsXally
MXstiIied. Their parents generally do in Iact  Iail  to  appreciate the XniTXe
individXality   oI   their   children,   and  instead  regard  their   children   as
e[tensions oI themselves, in mXch the same way as their Iine  clothes and
their  neatly manicXred lawns  and  their  polished cars  are e[tensions  oI
themselves which represent their statXs to the world. It is to these milder bXt
nonetheless destrXctive common Iorms oI parental narcissism that Kahlil
Gibran addresses himselI in what are perhaps the Iinest words ever written
aboXt child-raising:

                YoXr children are not yoXr children.

         The diIIicXlty   that hXmans so generally seem to  have in  IXlly
appreciating the separateness oI those who they are close to interIeres
not only with  their  parenting bXt with all  their intimate  relationships,
inclXding marriage. Not too long ago in a coXples groXp I heard one oI
the members state that the “pXrpose and IXnction” oI his wiIe  was to
Neep their hoXse neat and him well Ied. I was aghast at what seemed to
me  his   painIXlly   blatant   male   chaXvinism.  I   thoXght   I   might
demonstrate this to him by asNing the other members oI the groXp to
state how they perceived the pXrpose and IXnction oI their spoXses. To
my horror  the  si[  others, male  and Iemale aliNe, gave  very similar
answers. All   oI   them  deIined  the  pXrpose and  IXnction  oI   their
hXsbands or wives in  reIerence to themselves; all  oI  them Iailed  to
perceive that  their   own  mates might   have  an  e[istence  basically
separate Irom  their  own  or  any  Nind  oI  destiny  apart  Irom  their
marriage. “Good grieI,”  I  e[claimed,  “it’s  no wonder that yoX are all
having diIIicXlties   in  yoXr  marriages, and  yoX’ll  continXe  to  have
diIIicXlties Xntil yoX come to recognize that each oI yoX has yoXr own
separate destiny to  IXlIill.”    The  groXp Ielt   not  only  chastised bXt
proIoXndly conIXsed by my  pronoXncement. Somewhat belligerently
they asNed me to deIine the pXrpose and IXnction oI my  wiIe.  “The
pXrpose and IXnction oI Lily,” I responded, “is to grow to  be the most
oI which she is capable, not Ior my beneIit bXt Ior her own and to the
glory  oI God.”  The  concept remained alien to  them Ior  some time,
however.
         The problem oI separateness in close relationships has bedeviled
manNind throXgh the ages. However, it  has received more  attention
Irom a political  standpoint than Irom a marital one. PXre commXnism,
Ior   instance,   e[presses  a   philosophy   not    XnliNe  that   oI    the
aIorementioned coXples—namely, that the pXrpose and IXnction oI the
individXal is  to  serve the relationship, the  groXp, the collective,  the
society. Only the destiny oI the state is considered; the destiny oI the
individXal is believed to be oI no conseTXence. PXre capitalism, on the
other hand, espoXses the destiny oI the individXal even when it is at the
e[pense oI  the  relationship,  the  groXp, the  collective,  the  society.
:idows    and  orphans may  starve, bXt  this  shoXld not  prevent  the
individXal  entrepreneXr Irom  enMoying all the  IrXits  oI  his  or   her

131
individXal initiative.  It  shoXld be obvioXs to any discerning mind that
neither oI these pXre solXtions to the problem oI  separateness within
relationships will  be sXccessIXl The individXal’s health depends Xpon
the health oI  the society; the health oI  the society depends Xpon the
health oI  its individXals.  :hen    dealing with  coXples my wiIe  and  I
draw the  analogy between marriage and a  base camp Ior  moXntain
climbing. II  one wants to climb moXntains one mXst have a good base
camp, a place where there are shelters and provisions, where one may
receive nXrtXre and rest beIore one ventXres Iorth again to seeN another
sXmmit. SXccessIXl moXntain climbers Nnow that they mXst spend at
least as mXch time, iI not more, in tending to their  base camp as they
actXally do in climbing moXntains, Ior their sXrvival is dependent Xpon
their seeing to it that their  base camp is stXrdily constrXcted and well
stocNed.
         A   common  and  traditionally   mascXline  marital   problem  is
created by  the  hXsband who,  once he  is  married,  devotes all  his
energies to climbing moXntains and none to tending to his marriage, or
base camp, e[pecting  it   to  be there  in  perIect  order whenever  he
chooses to retXrn to it Ior rest and recreation withoXt his assXming any
responsibility  Ior  its  maintenance. Sooner or  later  this  “capitalist”
approach to the problem Iails and he retXrns to Iind his Xntended base
camp a shambles, his neglected wiIe  having been hospitalized Ior  a
nervoXs breaNdown, having rXn oII with another man, or in some other
way having renoXnced her Mob as camp caretaNer. An eTXally common
and traditionally Ieminine marital problem is  created by the wiIe who,
once she is married, Ieels that the goal oI her liIe  has been achieved.
To her the base camp is the peaN. She cannot Xnderstand or empathize
with her hXsband’s need Ior achievements and e[periences beyond the
marriage and reacts to them with MealoXsy and never-ending demands
that he  devote  increasingly  more energy  to  the  home. LiNe  other
“commXnist” resolXtions oI the problem, this one creates a relationship
that is  sXIIocating and stXltiIying,  Irom   which  the hXsband, Ieeling
trapped and limited, may liNely Ilee in  a moment oI “mid-liIe   crisis.”
The women’s liberation  movement has been helpIXl  in  pointing  the
way to what is obvioXsly the only ideal resolXtion: marriage as a trXly
cooperative institXtion, reTXiring great mXtXal contribXtions and care,

132
time and energy, bXt e[isting Ior the primary pXrpose oI nXrtXring each
oI  the  participants Ior   individXal  MoXrneys toward his or  her  own
individXal peaNs oI spiritXal growth. Male and Iemale both mXst tend
the hearth and both mXst ventXre Iorth.
         As an adolescent I Xsed to thrill  to  the words oI  love the early
American poet Ann Bradstreet spoNe to her hXsband: “II ever two were
one, then we.”*
         *  “To My  Dear  and Loving  Husband,” 1678, contained in The
Literature of the United  States, Walter Blair et al., eds. (Glenview. Ill.:
Scon. Foresman. 1953), p. 159.

         As I  have grown, however, I have come to  realize that it is  the
separateness oI the partners that enriches the Xnion. Great marriages
cannot be constrXcted by individXals who are terriIied  by  their basic
aloneness, as so  commonly   is  the  case, and  seeN a  merging  in
marriage. GenXine love not only respects the individXality oI the other
bXt actXally seeNs to cXltivate it, even at the risN oI separation or loss.
The Xltimate goal oI liIe remains the spiritXal growth oI the individXal,
the  solitary   MoXrney to peaNs  that  can  be   climbed  only   alone.
SigniIicant  MoXrneys cannot be  accomplished withoXt   the  nXrtXre
provided by  a sXccessIXl marriage or a sXccessIXl society. Marriage
and society e[ist  Ior  the  basic pXrpose oI nXrtXring sXch individXal
MoXrneys. BXt, as is the case with all  genXine love,  “sacriIices”  on
behalI oI the growth  oI the other  resXlt in eTXal or greater growth oI
the selI. It is  the retXrn oI the individXal  to the nXrtXring marriage or
society Irom  the peaNs he or she has traveled alone which serves to
elevate that  marriage or  that  society  to  new  heights.  In  this  way
individXal  growth  and societal  growth  are interdependent, bXt it  is
always and inevitably lonely  oXt on the growing  edge. It is  Irom  the
loneliness oI his wisdom that once again the prophet oI Kahlil Gibran
speaNs to Xs concerning marriage:

         BXt let there be spaces in yoXr togetherness,
         And let the winds oI the heavens dance between yoX

         Love one another, bXt maNe not a bond oI love:

133
                Let  it rather be a moving sea between the shores oI yoXr soXls.
                Fill  each other’s cXp bXt drinN not Irom one cXp.
                Give  one another oI yoXr bread bXt eat not Irom the same loaI
                Sing  and dance together and be MoyoXs, bXt let each one oI yoX
       be alone,
                Even  as the strings oI a lXte are alone thoXgh they TXiver with
       the same mXsic.

                Give  yoXr hearts, bXt not into each other’s Neeping.
                For only  the hand oI LiIe can contain yoXr hearts.
                And  stand together yet not too near together:
                For the pillars oI the temple stand apart,
                And   the  oaN tree and  the  cypress grow  not  in  each other’s
       shadow. *

         LoYe  and   Psychotherapy


         It is  hard Ior me to  recaptXre now the motivation and Xnderstanding
with which  I  entered the Iield oI  psychiatry IiIteen  years ago. Certainly I
wanted to  “help”   people.  The  process oI   helping  people in   the  other
branches oI medicine involved technology with which I was XncomIortable
and which in  other ways seemed too mechanical to sXit my  tastes. I also
IoXnd talNing to people more IXn than poNing and prodding them, and the
TXirNs oI the hXman mind seemed inherently more interesting to me than
the TXirNs oI  the  body  or  the  germs  inIesting  it.   I  had  no  idea how
psychiatrists helped people, e[cept Ior  the Iantasy that  psychiatrists were
the possessors oI magical words and magical techniTXes oI interacting with
patients which   woXld  magically  Xnscramble  the  Nnots oI  the   psyche.
Perhaps I wanted to be a magician. I  had very  little  notion that  the worN
involved woXld have something to do with the spiritXal growth oI  patients,
and certainly I  had  no notion  whatsoever that it  woXld  involve  my own
spiritXal growth.
         DXring my Iirst ten months oI training I worNed with highly distXrbed
inpatients who seemed to beneIit mXch more Irom pills or shocN treatments

134
or good nXrsing care than they did  Irom  me, bXt I  learned the traditional
magical words and techniTXes oI interaction. AIter  this  period I  began to
see my Iirst neXrotic patient Ior long-term oXtpatient psychotherapy. Let me
call her Marcia.  Marcia came to see me three times a weeN. It was a real
strXggle. She woXldn’t talN aboXt the things I wanted her to talN aboXt, and
she woXldn’t talN aboXt them in the way I wanted, and sometimes she MXst
woXldn’t talN at all.  In  some ways oXr valXes were TXite diIIerent; in the
strXggle she came to modiIy  hers somewhat and I  came to modiIy  mine
somewhat. BXt the strXggle continXed despite my  storehoXse oI magical
words and techniTXes and postXres, and there was no sign that Marcia was
improving. Indeed, shortly aIter she started to see me she began a pattern oI
almost oXtrageoXs promiscXity, and Ior months she recoXnted Xnabatedly
innXmerable incidents oI “bad behavior.”  Finally, aIter  a year oI  this, she
asNed me in the middle oI a session “Do yoX thinN I’m a bit oI a shit?”
         “YoX seem to be asNing me to tell yoX what I thinN oI yoX,” I replied,
brilliantly  stalling Ior time.
         That was e[actly  what she wanted, she said. BXt what did I do now?
:hat   magical words or techniTXes or postXres coXld help me? I coXld say,
“:hy    do yoX asN that?” or “:hat   are yoXr Iantasies aboXt what I thinN oI
yoX?” or “:hat’s     important, Marcia,  is not what  I thinN oI  yoX bXt what
yoX thinN oI yoXrselI.” Yet I had an overpowering Ieeling that these gambits
were cop-oXts, and that aIter a whole year oI seeing me three times a weeN
the least Marcia was entitled to was an honest answer Irom me as to what I
thoXght oI her. BXt Ior  this  I had  no precedent; telling a  person honestly
Iace to Iace what yoX thinN oI him or her was not one oI the magical words
or techniTXes that any oI my proIessors had taXght me. It was an interaction
that had never been sXggested or recommended in my training; the very Iact
that it had not been mentioned indicated to me that it was an interaction that
was disapproved oI, a sitXation  that any repXtable psychiatrist woXld not
allow himselI to  Iall into.  How to  act? :ith   my  heart poXnding I went oXt
on what seemed to be a very shaNy limb indeed. “Marcia,” I said, “yoX have
been seeing me now Ior over a year. DXring this long period .oI time things
have not gone smoothly Ior Xs. MXch oI the time we have been strXggling,
and the strXggle has oIten been boring or nerve-wracNing or angry Ior both
oI  Xs. Yet despite this  yoX  have continXed to  come bacN to  see me  at
considerable eIIort and inconvenience to yoX, session aIter session, weeN

135
aIter weeN, month aIter  month. YoX woXldn’t  have been able  to do  this
Xnless yoX were the Nind oI person who is .determined to grow and willing
to worN very hard at maNing yoXrselI a better person. I do not thinN I woXld
Ieel that someone who worNs as hard on herselI as yoX do is a bit oI a shit.
So the answer is, No, I do not thinN yoX are a bit oI a shit. In Iact, I admire
yoX a great deal.”
         From among her dozens oI lovers Marcia immediately picNed one and
established a meaningIXl relationship with  him which  eventXally led to  a
highly   sXccessIXl  and   satisIying    marriage.   She   was   never   again
promiscXoXs. She immediately began to speaN aboXt the good things  in
herselI. The sense oI XnprodXctive strXggle between Xs instantly vanished,
and oXr worN  became IlXent and MoyIXl, with  incredibly  rapid  progress.
Strangely, my  going oXt  on a  limb  by  revealing  my  genXinely positive
Ieelings Ior her—something I  Ielt I  was really not  sXpposed to do—rather
than seeming to hXrt her, apparently was oI  great therapeXtic beneIit and
clearly represented the tXrning point in oXr worN together.
         :hat   does this mean? Does it mean that all we have to do to practice
sXccessIXl psychotherapy is to tell oXr patients that we thinN well oI them?
Hardly. First  oI all,  it  is  necessary to be honest in therapy at all  times. I
honestly did admire and liNe Marcia. Second, my admiration and liNing was
oI real  signiIicance to  her precisely  becaXse oI the length oI  time  I  had
Nnown her and the depth oI oXr e[periences in therapy. In Iact, the essence
oI this tXrning point did not even have to do with my liNing and admiration;
it had to do with the natXre oI oXr relationship.
         A  similarly  dramatic tXrning  point came in  the therapy oI  a yoXng
woman I will   call  Helen, whom I  had been seeing twice weeNly Ior  nine
months with a noticeable lacN oI sXccess and Ior whom I did not yet have
mXch positive Ieeling. Indeed, aIter all that time I  did not even have mXch
oI a Ieeling oI  who Helen was at all.  I had never beIore seen a patient Ior
sXch a  length  oI   time  withoXt  having  gained  some  idea  oI  who  the
individXal was and the natXre oI the problem to  be resolved. I was totally
conIXsed by her and had spent the better part oI several nights attempting
withoXt any sXccess whatsoever to maNe some sense oXt oI the case. AboXt
all that was clear to me was that Helen did not trXst me. She was vociIeroXs
in her complaints that I did not genXinely care Ior her in any way, shape or
Iorm and was interested only in her money. She was talNing in this Iashion

136
dXring one session, aIter nine months oI therapy: “YoX cannot imagine, Dr.
PecN, how IrXstrating it is Ior me to attempt to commXnicate with yoX when
yoX are so Xninterested in me and thereIore so oblivioXs to my Ieelings.”
         “Helen,”  I  replied, “it  seems to be IrXstrating Ior both oI  Xs. I don’t
Nnow how this will  maNe yoX Ieel, bXt yoX are the single most IrXstrating
case I have ever had in a decade oI practicing psychotherapy. I have never
met anyone with   whom  I  have made  less headway in  so  long  a  time.
Perhaps yoX are. right in believing that I  am not  the right person to worN
with  yoX. I  don’t  Nnow. I  don’t  want to  give  Xp, bXt I  sXre as hell  am
pXzzled aboXt yoX, and I wonder Xntil I’m almost crazy as to what the hell
is wrong in oXr worN together.”
         A glowing  smile came over Helen’s Iace. “YoX really do care Ior me
aIter all,” she said.
         “HXh?” I asNed.
         “II  yoX didn’t really  care Ior me yoX woXldn’t Ieel so IrXstrated,” she
replied, as iI it were all perIectly obvioXs.
         At  the very ne[t  session Helen began to tell  me things that she had
previoXsly either withheld or actXally lied aboXt, and within a weeN I had a
clear Xnderstanding oI  her basic  problem, coXld  maNe a diagnosis, and
Nnew generally how the therapy shoXld proceed.
         Again, my  reaction to  Helen was meaningIXl and signiIicant  to  her
precisely becaXse oI the depth oI my involvement with her and the intensity
oI oXr strXggle together. :e are now able to see the essential ingredient that
maNes psychotherapy eIIective and  sXccessIXl. It  is  not  “Xnconditional
positive regard,” nor is it magical words, techniTXes or postXres; it is hXman
involvement and strXggle. It  is  the willingness  oI  the therapist to  e[tend
himselI  or  herselI  Ior  the  pXrpose oI  nXrtXring the  patient’s  growth—
willingness to  go oXt on  a limb,  to trXly  involve  oneselI at an emotional
level  in  the relationship,  to  actXally strXggle  with  the  patient and  with
oneselI. In short, the essential ingredient oI sXccessIXl deep and meaningIXl
psychotherapy is love.
         It is  remarNable, almost incredible, that the volXminoXs proIessional
literatXre in the :est   on the sXbMect oI psychotherapy ignores the issXe oI
love. HindX gXrXs IreTXently maNe no bones aboXt the Iact that their love is
the soXrce oI their power.*

137
         *  See Peter Brent, The  God Men  of India  (New York:  Quadrangle
Books, 1972).

         BXt the closest :estern literatXre comes to the issXe are those articles
that attempt to  analyze diIIerences  between sXccessIXl and XnsXccessIXl
psychotherapists and XsXally end Xp  mentioning  sXch characteristics oI
sXccessIXl psychotherapists as “warmth”   and “empathy.”   Basically,  we
seem to be  embarrassed by the sXbMect oI love. There are a  nXmber oI
reasons Ior this state oI aIIairs. One is the conIXsion between genXine love
and romantic  love  which  so pervades oXr  cXltXre, as well  as the  other
conIXsions that have been dealt with  in  this section. Another  is  oXr bias
toward  the   rational,   the  tangible   and  the   measXrable in   “scientiIic
medicine,” and it is largely  oXt oI “scientiIic  medicine” that the proIession
oI  psychotherapy  evolved.  Since   love  is   an  intangible,   incompletely
measXrable and sXprarational phenomenon, It has not lent itselI to scientiIic
analysis.
         Another  reason is  the  strength oI   the  psychoanalytic tradition   in
psychiatry oI the alooI  and detached analyst, a tradition Ior which FreXd’s
Iollowers  more than FreXd himselI  seem to be  responsible. In this  same
tradition,  any Ieelings  oI  love  that  the patient  has Ior  the  therapist are
generally labeled “transIerence” and any Ieelings oI love that the therapist
has Ior  the patient  “coXntertransIerence,” with  the implication  that  sXch
Ieelings are abnormal, a part oI the problem rather than its solXtion, and are
to be avoided. This  is all  TXite absXrd. TransIerence, as mentioned in the
previoXs  section,   reIers   to   inappropriate   Ieelings,    perceptions  and
responses. There is nothing inappropriate aboXt patients coming to love a
therapist who trXly listens to them hoXr aIter hoXr in a nonMXdgmental way,
who trXly accepts them as they probably have never been accepted beIore,
who  totally   reIrains  Irom   Xsing  them  and  who  has  been  helpIXl  in
alleviating their sXIIering. Indeed, the essence oI the transIerence in many
cases is   that  which   prevents  the  patient   Irom   developing  a   loving
relationship with the therapist, and the cXre consists oI worNing throXgh the
transIerence so   that   the   patient   can  e[perience   a   sXccessIXl  love
relationship, oIten  ,Ior   the Iirst   time.  Similarly,  there  is  nothing  at  all
inappropriate in the Ieelings oI love that a therapist develops Ior his or her
patient  when  the  patient  sXbmits  to   the  discipline  oI   psychotherapy,

138
cooperates in the  treatment, is  willing   to  learn  Irom  the  therapist, and
sXccessIXlly  begins   .to    grow    throXgh   the    relationship.   Intensive
psychotherapy in many  ways is  a  process oI reparenting. It   is no  more
inappropriate Ior  a psychotherapist to have Ieelings  oI love  Ior  a patient
than it  is Ior  a  good parent to  have Ieelings  oI  love Ior  a  child.  To the
contrary, it is essential Ior the therapist to love a patient Ior  the therapy to
be  sXccessIXl, and  iI   the  therapy  does  become  sXccessIXl, then  the
therapeXtic relationship will become a mXtXally loving one. It is inevitable
that the  therapist  will   e[perience  loving  Ieelings  coincidental  with   the
genXine love he or she has demonstrated toward the patient.
         For the most part, mental illness is caXsed by an absence oI or deIect
in the  love that  a particXlar child  reTXired Irom its  particXlar parents Ior
sXccessIXl matXration and spiritXal growth. It is obvioXs, then, that in order
to  be healed  throXgh psychotherapy the  patient  mXst receive Irom   the
psychotherapist at least a portion oI the genXine love oI which  the patient
was deprived.  II   the  psychotherapist cannot  genXinely  love  a  patient,
genXine healing will not occXr. No matter how well credentialed and trained
psychotherapists may be, iI they cannot e[tend themselves throXgh love to
their  patients,  the  resXlts  oI   their  psychotherapeXtic practice  will    be
generally XnsXccessIXl. Conversely, a totally Xncredentialed and minimally
trained lay  therapist who  e[ercises a great  capacity to  love will   achieve
psychotherapeXtic resXlts that eTXal those oI the very best psychiatrists.
         Since love  and se[  are so  closely related  and interconnected, it  is
appropriate to   mention  here  brieIly   the  issXe  oI   se[Xal  relationships
between psychotherapists and  their  patients, an  issXe that  is   cXrrently
receiving a good deal oI attention in  the press. BecaXse oI the necessarily
loving  and  intimate  natXre oI   the  psychotherapeXtic relationship,  it  is
inevitable  that both  patients  and therapists  roXtinely  develop strong  or
e[tremely strong se[Xal attractions to each other. The pressXres to se[Xally
consXmmate sXch attractions may be enormoXs. I sXspect that some oI those
in the proIession oI  psychotherapy who cast stones at a therapist who has
related se[Xally with a patient may not themselves be loving therapists and
may not  thereIore  have any  real  Xnderstanding oI  the enormity  oI   the
pressXres involved. Moreover,  were  I  ever  to  have  a case in   which  I
conclXded aIter  careIXl  and  MXdicioXs consideration that  my   patient’s
spiritXal growth  woXld  be  sXbstantially IXrthered  by  oXr having  se[Xal

139
relations, I   woXld  proceed to  have  them.  In  IiIteen  years  oI  practice,
however, I have not yet had sXch a case, and I Iind  it diIIicXlt  to  imagine
that sXch a case coXld really e[ist. First oI all, as I have mentioned, the role
oI the good therapist is primarily that oI  the good parent, and good parents
do not consXmmate se[Xal relationships with their children Ior several very
compelling reasons. The Mob oI a parent is to be oI Xse to a child and not to
Xse the child Ior personal satisIaction. The Mob oI a therapist is to be oI Xse
to a patient and not to Xse the patient to serve the therapist’s own needs. The
Mob oI a parent is to encoXrage a child along the path toward independence,
and the Mob oI a therapist with a patient is the same. It is diIIicXlt to see how
a therapist who  related  se[Xally  with  a  patient woXld  not  be Xsing the
patient to  satisIy  his  or  her own  needs or  how  the  therapist woXld  be
encoXraging the patient’s independence thereby.
         Many  patients, particXlarly those liNely  to be  most sedXctive, have
se[Xalized attachments to their parents which clearly impede their Ireedom
and growth. Both  theory and the  scant bit oI  evidence available strongly
sXggest that a se[Xal relationship between a therapist and sXch a patient is
Iar more liNely to cement the patient’s immatXre attachments than to loosen
them. Even iI the relationship is not se[Xally consXmmated, it is detrimental
Ior the therapist to “Iall   in love”  with  the patient, since, as we have seen,
Ialling in love involves a collapse oI ego boXndaries and a diminXtion oI the
normal sense oI separation that e[ists  between individXals.  The therapist
who Ialls  in  love  with  a  patient cannot  possibly be  obMective aboXt the
patient’s needs or separate those needs Irom his or her own. It is oXt oI love
Ior their patients that therapists do not allow  themselves the indXlgence oI
Ialling  in  love  with   them. Since  genXine love  demands respect Ior  the
separate identity   oI  the   beloved,  the  genXinely  loving   therapist  will
recognize and accept that the patient’s path in liIe is and shoXld be separate
Irom that oI the therapist. For some therapists this means that their own and
the patient’s  paths shoXld never  cross oXtside oI  the  therapeXtic hoXr.”
:hile    I   respect this  position,  Ior   myselI  I  Iind   it  Xnnecessarily rigid.
AlthoXgh I have had one e[perience in which  my relating  to an e[-patient
seemed to  be  deIinitely   detrimental  to  her,  I   have had  several  other
e[periences in which  social  relationships with  e[-patients seemed clearly
beneIicial to them as well as to myselI. I have also been IortXnate enoXgh to
sXccessIXlly analyze several very close Iriends. Nonetheless, social contact

140
with the patient oXtside oI the therapeXtic hoXr, even aIter therapy has been
Iormally  terminated, is  something that  shoXld be entered into  only  with
great caXtion and stringent selI-e[amination  as to  whether the therapist’s
needs are being met by the contact to the detriment oI the patient’s.
         :e   have been e[amining the Iact that psychotherapy shoXld be (mXst
be, iI sXccessIXl) a process oI genXine love, a somewhat heretical notion in
traditional psychiatric  circles. The  other side oI  the same coin is  at least
eTXally heretical: iI psychotherapy is genXinely loving, shoXld love always
be psychotherapeXtic? II we genXinely love  oXr spoXse, oXr parents, oXr
children,  oXr Iriends,  iI   we  e[tend   oXrselves to  nXrtXre their  spiritXal
growth, shoXld we be practicing psychotherapy with them? My  answer is:
Certainly. From time to time at cocNtail parties someone will say to me, “It
mXst be diIIicXlt Ior  yoX, Dr.  PecN, to separate yoXr social liIe Irom yoXr
proIessional liIe. AIter  all, one can’t go aroXnd analyzing one’s Iamily and
Iriends, can one?” UsXally the speaNer is only maNing idle conversation and
is neither interested in nor ready to assimilate a serioXs reply. Occasionally,
however, the  sitXation  gives  me  the  opportXnity   to  teach  or  practice
psychotherapy there and then, on the spot, e[plaining MXst why I do not even
attempt, or  woXld want  to  attempt to  separate my  proIessional and my
personal lives. II  I perceive my  wiIe or  my children  or my  parents or my
Iriends  sXIIering  Irom   an  illXsion,   a  Ialsehood,  an   ignorance  or  an
Xnnecessary impediment, I have every  bit  as mXch obligation  to  e[tend
myselI to  them to correct  the sitXation insoIar as possible, as I  do to my
patients, who pay me Ior  my services. Am I  to withhold  my  services, my
wisdom and my love Irom my Iamily  and my Iriends becaXse they have not
speciIically contracted and paid me Ior my attention to  their psychological
needs? Hardly. How can I be a good Iriend, Iather, hXsband or son Xnless I
taNe the opportXnities that are available to attempt, with whatever artistry I
can command,  to  teach  my  beloved  what  I  Nnow  and give   whatever
assistance is in my power to give to his or her personal MoXrneys oI spiritXal
growth? Moreover, I e[pect  the same services Irom my Iriends and Iamily
to  the  limits   oI  their  ability.   AlthoXgh  their  criticism   oI   me  may  be
Xnnecessarily blXnt at times and their teaching may not be as thoXghtIXl as
an adXlt’s, I learn mXch to help me Irom my children. My wiIe gXides me as
mXch as I  gXide her.  I  woXld not  call  my  Iriends  Iriends were  they  to
withhold Irom  me the honesty oI their disapproval and their loving concern

141
as to the wisdom and saIety oI the directions oI my own MoXrney. Can I not
grow more rapidly  with  their  help than withoXt  it? Any  genXinely loving
relationship is one oI mXtXal psychotherapy.
         I  have  not  always  seen  it  this  way.   In  years  past I   was  more
appreciative oI my wiIe’s admiration than oI her criticism, and did as mXch
to Ioster her dependency as I did her  power. My  selI-image as a hXsband
and Iather  was that  oI  provider;  my  responsibility  ended with  bringing
home the bacon. Home I wanted to be a place oI comIort, not challenge. At
that time   I  woXld  have  agreed with   the  proposition  that  it  woXld  be
dangeroXs and Xnethical and destrXctive Ior a psychotherapist to practice
his art Xpon his  Iriends and Iamily.  BXt  my agreement was motivated as
mXch by  laziness  as  it  was  by   Iear  oI  misXsing  my  proIession.  For
psychotherapy, liNe love, is worN, and it’s easier to worN eight hoXrs a day
than it is  to worN si[teen.  It’s  also easier to love a  person who seeNs oXt
yoXr wisdom, who travels to  yoXr territory  to obtain it,  who pays yoX Ior
yoXr attention and whose  demands Xpon yoX are strictly  limited  to  IiIty
minXtes at a time than it is to love someone who regards yoXr attention as a
right, whose demands may not be limited, who does not perceive yoX as an
aXthority  IigXre  and  who  does  not  solicit   yoXr  teaching.  CondXcting
psychotherapy at home or with one’s Iriends reTXires the same intensity oI
eIIort and selI-discipline  as it does in the oIIice  bXt Xnder mXch less ideal
conditions, which  is to  say that at home it  reTXires even more eIIort and
love. I hope, thereIore, that other psychotherapists will not taNe these words
as an e[hortation to immediately begin practicing psychotherapy with their
mates and children. II one remains on a MoXrney oI spiritXal growth, one’s
capacity to love grows and grows. BXt it is  always limited, and one dearly
shoXld not  attempt psychotherapy beyond  one’s capacity  to  love,  since
psychotherapy withoXt love will  be XnsXccessIXl and even harmIXl. II yoX
can love si[   hoXrs a day, be content with  that  Ior  the moment, Ior  yoXr
capacity is already Iar greater than most; the MoXrney is a long one and it
reTXires time Ior  yoXr capacity to  grow.  To practice psychotherapy with
one’s Iriends and Iamily, to love one another IXll time, is an ideal, a goal to
be striven toward bXt not instantly achieved.
         Since,   as  I    have   indicated,   laymen   can   practice   sXccessIXl
psychotherapy withoXt great training as long as they are genXinely loving
hXman beings,  the  remarNs I   have  made  concerning  the  practice  oI

142
psychotherapy on   one’s  Iriends   and  Iamily   do   not   apply  solely   to
proIessional therapists; they apply to everyone. Occasionally when patients
asN me when they will   be ready to  terminate their  therapy, I  will   reply,
“:hen    yoX yoXrselI are able to  be a good therapist.”  This reply  is  oIten
most XseIXlly made in groXp therapy, where patients oI coXrse do practice
psychotherapy on  each  other  and  where their   IailXres  to  sXccessIXlly
assXme the role  oI  psychotherapist can be  pointed  oXt to  them.  Many
patients do not liNe this reply, and some will actXally say, “That’s too mXch
worN. To do  that  means that I  woXld  have to  thinN all  the  time  in  my
relationships with people. I don’t  want to thinN that mXch. I  don’t want to
worN that  hard.  I   MXst want to  enMoy myselI.” Patients  oIten  respond
similarly   when  I   point   oXt  to  them  that   all   hXman interactions  are
opportXnities either to learn  or to  teach (to give  or  receive therapy), and
when they neither learn nor teach in an interaction they  are passing Xp an
opportXnity. Most people are TXite correct when they say they do not want
to achieve sXch a loIty goal or worN so hard in liIe. The maMority oI patients,
even in the hands oI the most sNilled and loving  therapists, will  terminate
their therapy at some point Iar short oI completely IXlIilling  their potential.
They may have traveled a short or even a goodly distance along the MoXrney
oI spiritXal growth, bXt the whole MoXrney is not Ior them. It is or seems to
be too diIIicXlt. They are content to be ordinary men and women and do not
strive to be God.

         The  Mystery     of  LoYe


         This  discXssion began many pages bacN by  noting  that  love  is  a
mysterioXs sXbMect and that Xntil now the mystery has been ignored. The
TXestions raised here so  Iar  have  been answered. BXt  there  are  other
TXestions, not so easy to answer.
         One set oI sXch TXestions derives rather logically Irom  the material
thXs Iar discXssed. It has been made clear, Ior instance, that selI-discipline
develops Irom  the  IoXndation oI   love.  BXt this  leaves  Xnanswered the
TXestion oI where love itselI comes Irom. And iI we asN that, we mXst also
asN what are  the  soXrces oI  the  absence oI  love.  It  has  been IXrther
sXggested that the absence oI love is the maMor caXse oI mental illness and

143
that the presence ‘oI love is  conseTXently the essential healing element in
psychotherapy. This being so, how is  it that  certain individXals, born and
raised in  an environment  oI  nonlove, oI  Xnremitting  neglect and  casXal
brXtality, somehow manage to transcend their childhood, sometimes even
withoXt the loving assistance oI psychotherapy, and become matXre, healthy
and perhaps even saintly people? Conversely, how is it that some patients,
apparently no more  ill  than others, Iail   partially  or totally   to respond to
psychotherapeXtic treatment by even the most wise and loving therapist?
         An attempt will   be made to answer this set oI TXestions in the Iinal
section, on  grace.  The  attempt will    not  meet  with  anyone’s  complete
satisIaction, inclXding my  own. I  hope, however, what  I  write  will  bring
some enlightenment. There is another set oI  TXestions having to do with
matters deliberately omitted or glossed over in the discXssion oI love. :hen
my beloved Iirst  stands beIore me naNed, all open to my sight,  there is a
Ieeling throXghoXt the whole oI me: awe. :hy?    II se[  is no more than an
instinct,  why  don’t  I  MXst Ieel “horny”  or  hXngry? SXch simple  hXnger
woXld be TXite sXIIicient  to  insXre the propagation oI  the  species. :hy
awe? :hy   shoXld se[ be complicated with reverence? And Ior that matter,
what is it  that  determines beaXty? I have said the obMect oI genXine love
mXst be a person, since only  people have spirits  capable oI growth.  BXt
what  aboXt the  Iinest  creation  by  a  master woodworNer? Or   the  best
scXlptXres oI medieval  madonnas? Or  the  bronze  statXe oI  the  GreeN
charioteer at Delphi?    :ere    these inanimate obMects not loved by  their
creators and is not  their beaXty somehow related to  their  creators’ love?
:hat   aboXt the beaXty oI natXre—natXre, to which we sometimes give the
name “creation”? And why in  the presence oI beaXty or Moy do we so oIten
have the strange, parado[ical reaction oI  sadness or tears? How is it  that
certain bars oI mXsic played or sXng in certain ways can move Xs so? And
why do I  become wet-eyed when my si[-year-old  son, still  ill  on  his Iirst
night home Irom the hospital aIter a tonsillectomy, sXddenly comes over to
where I  am lying,  tired, on  the Iloor  and begins to  rXb my  bacN gently?
Clearly there are dimensions oI love that have not  been discXssed and are
most diIIicXlt  to  Xnderstand. I do not thinN TXestions aboXt these aspects
(and many more) will  be answered by sociobiology.  Ordinary psychology
with its  Nnowledge oI ego boXndaries may be oI a little  help—bXt only  a
little. The people who Nnow the most aboXt sXch things are those among the

144
religioXs who are stXdents oI Mystery. It  is to  them and to  the sXbMect oI
religion that we mXst tXrn iI  we are to obtain even glimmerings oI  insight
into these matters. The remainder oI this booN will deal with certain Iacets
oI  religion.   The  ne[t   section will    discXss in  a  very  limited   way  the
relationship between religion and the growth process. The Iinal section will
IocXs on the phenomenon oI grace and the role it plays in this process. The
concept oI grace has been Iamiliar to religion Ior millennia, bXt it is Ioreign
to   science,  inclXding    psychology.   Nonetheless,  I    believe   that   an
Xnderstanding oI   the  phenomenon oI   grace  is   essential to   complete
Xnderstanding oI the process oI growth in hXman beings. :hat Iollows will,
I hope, represent a contribXtion to the  slowly enlarging  interIace between
religion and the science oI psychology.

145
SECTION III

Growth  and
Religion

146
         World    VieZs   and   Religion


         As  hXman beings grow in  discipline  and love  and liIe   e[perience,
their Xnderstanding oI the world and their place in it natXrally grows apace.
Conversely, as people Iail to grow in discipline, love and liIe e[perience, so
does their Xnderstanding Iail to grow. ConseTXently, among the members oI
the hXman race there e[ists an e[traordinary variability  in  the breadth and
sophistication oI oXr Xnderstanding oI what liIe is all aboXt.
         This   Xnderstanding is   oXr   religion.   Since  everyone  has   some
Xnderstanding—some world view, no  matter how  limited  or primitive   or
inaccXrate—everyone has a religion. This Iact, not widely recognized, is oI
the Xtmost importance: everyone has a religion.
         :e   sXIIer, I believe, Irom a tendency to deIine religion too narrowly.
:e    tend to  thinN  that  religion  mXst  inclXde a  belieI  in   God  or  some
ritXalistic practice or membership in  a worshiping groXp. :e   are liNely  to
say oI someone who does not attend chXrch or believe in a sXperior being,
“He or she is not religioXs.” I  have even heard scholars say sXch things as:
“BXddhism is not  really a religion”   or “Unitarians  have e[clXded religion
Irom their Iaith”   or “Mysticism  is more a philosophy  than a religion.”  :e
tend to view religion  as something monolithic, cXt oXt oI whole cloth,  and
then, with  this  simplistic   concept, we  are pXzzled as to  how  two  very
diIIerent people can both call  themselves Christians. Or Jews. Or how  an
atheist might have a more highly developed sense oI Christian morality than
a Catholic who roXtinely attends mass.
         In sXpervising other psychotherapists I rather roXtinely Iind that they
pay too little,  iI any, attention to the ways in  which their  patients view the
world. There are several reasons Ior this, bXt among them is the notion that
iI  patients don’t consider themselves religioXs by virtXe  oI their  belieI  in
God or their chXrch membership, they are lacNing in religion and the matter
thereIore needs no  IXrther  scrXtiny. BXt  the  Iact  oI  the  matter  is  that
everyone has an  e[plicit   or  implicit   set  oI  ideas and  belieIs as  to  the
essential natXre oI the world. Do patients envision the Xniverse as basically
chaotic and withoXt  meaning so that it  is  only  sensible Ior them to  grab
whatever little pleasXre they can whenever it is available? Do they see the

147
world  as  a dog-eat-dog  place where  rXthlessness is  essential Ior  their
sXrvival? Or do they see it as a nXrtXring sort oI place in which something
good will  always tXrn Xp and in which  they need not Iret  mXch aboXt the
IXtXre? Or a place that owes them a living no matter how they condXct their
lives? Or a Xniverse oI rigid law in which they will  be strXcN down and cast
away iI they step even slightly oXt oI  line? Et cetera. There are all manner
oI diIIerent  world views  that people have. Sooner or later in the coXrse oI
psychotherapy most therapists will come to recognize how a patient views
the world, bXt iI the therapist is speciIically on the looNoXt Ior it, he or she
will  come to this recognition sooner rather than later. And it is essential that
therapists arrive at this Nnowledge, Ior the world view oI patients is always
an essential part oI their problems, and a correction in their  world view  is
necessary Ior their  cXre. So  I  say to  those I  sXpervise: “Find  oXt  yoXr
patients’ religions even iI they say they don’t have any.”
         UsXally a person’s religion or world view is at best only incompletely
conscioXs. Patients are oIten Xnaware oI how  they  view  the world,  and
sometimes may even thinN they possess a certain Nind oI religion when they
actXally  are possessed by  a   Iar  diIIerent   Nind.  Stewart, a   sXccessIXl
indXstrial engineer, became severely depressed in his mid-IiIties.  Despite
his sXccess at worN and the Iact that he had been an e[emplary hXsband and
Iather, he Ielt worthless and evil.  “The  world  woXld be a better place iI  I
were dead,” he said. And meant it. Stewart had made two e[tremely serioXs
sXicide attempts. No  amoXnt oI  realistic reassXrance coXld interrXpt the
Xnrealism oI his worthless selI-image. As well as the XsXal symptoms oI a
severe depression, sXch as insomnia and agitation, Stewart also  sXIIered
great diIIicXlty  in  swallowing  his Iood.  “It’s  not  MXst that the Iood tastes
bad,” he said. “That, too. BXt it’s as iI there’s a blade oI steel stXcN straight
in my throat and nothing bXt liTXid can get by it.”  Special ;-rays  and tests
Iailed to reveal a physical  caXse Ior his diIIicXlty. Stewart made no bones
aboXt his religion.  “I’m   an  atheist, plain  and simple,”  he stated. “I’m   a
scientist. The only  things  I  believe in  are those  things yoX can  see and
toXch. Maybe I’d  be better oII  iI I  had some Nind oI Iaith  in  a sweet and
loving God, bXt, IranNly, I can’t stomach that Nind oI crap. I had enoXgh oI
it when I  was a child and I’m  glad I’ve  gotten away Irom it.”   Stewart had
grown  Xp   in   a  small   Midwestern   commXnity,   the  son   oI   a  rigid

148
IXndamentalist preacher and his eTXally rigid and IXndamentalist wiIe, and
had leIt home and chXrch at the Iirst opportXnity.
         Several months  aIter  he  entered treatment  Stewart recoXnted the
Iollowing  brieI dream: “It was bacN in my childhood home in Minnesota. It
was liNe I was still  living  there as a child, yet I  also Nnew I was the same
age as I am now. It was nighttime.  A  man had entered the hoXse. He was
going to cXt oXr throats. I had never seen this man beIore, bXt strangely I
Nnew who he was: the Iather oI a girl I had dated a coXple oI times in high
school. That  was all.  There  was no  conclXsion. I  MXst woNe Xp IearIXl,
Nnowing that this man wanted to cXt oXr throats.”
         I asNed Stewart to tell me everything he coXld aboXt this man in his
dream. “There’s really  nothing I  can tell  yoX,”  he said. “I  never  met the
man. I  only  dated his daXghter a coXple oI  times—not  really dates, MXst
walNing her home to her door aIter chXrch yoXth groXp meetings. I did steal
a Niss Irom her in  the darN behind some bXshes on one oI those walNs.”
Here Stewart gave a little nervoXs laXgh and went on, “In my dream I had
the sense I’d never seen her Iather, althoXgh I Nnew who he was. ActXally,
in real liIe I did  see him—Irom a distance. He was the stationmaster Ior oXr
town. Occasionally I  woXld see him when I  Xsed to go to  the station and
watch the trains come in on sXmmer aIternoons.”
         Something clicNed  in  my  mind.  I   too  as a  child  had  spent lazy
sXmmer aIternoons watching the trains go by. The train station was where
the action was. And  the stationmaster was the Director oI  the Action.  He
Nnew the distant places Irom which the great trains were coming to  toXch
oXr little town  and the Iaraway places to which they were going. He Nnew
which trains woXld stop and which woXld roar throXgh, shaNing the earth as
they went. He worNed the switches, the signals. He received the mail and
sent it oII. And when he was not doing these wonderIXl things he sat in his
oIIice doing something more wonderIXl: tapping on a magical little Ney in a
mysterioXs rhythmical langXage, sending messages oXt to the whole world.
         “Stewart,”  I  said, “yoX  have told  me  that yoX’re  an atheist, and  I
believe yoX. There is a part oI yoXr mind that believes there is no God. BXt
I am beginning to sXspect that there is another part oI yoXr mind that does
believe in God—a dangeroXs, cXtthroat God.”
         My   sXspicion  was  correct.   GradXally,  as  we   worNed  together,
relXctantly, striving against resistance, Stewart began to recognize within

149
himselI a strange and Xgly Iaith:  an assXmption, beyond his atheism, that
the world was  controlled and directed by  a malevolent Iorce, a Iorce  that
not only  coXld cXt his throat bXt that was eager to do so, eager to pXnish
him   Ior    transgressions.  Slowly   also   we    began  to    IocXs  on    his
“transgressions,” mostly minor se[Xal incidents symbolized by his “stealing
a Niss” Irom the  stationmaster’s daXghter. EventXally it became clear that
(among other reasons Ior his depression) Stewart was doing penance and
IigXratively cXtting  his own  throat in  the hope that by  so doing he coXld
prevent God Irom literally cXtting it.
         :here   did Stewart’s notion oI  a vicioXs God and a malevolent world
come Irom?   How  do   people’s  religions  develop?  :hat    determines  a
person’s  particXlar    world    view?   There   are    whole   comple[es    oI
determinants, and this booN will not e[plore the TXestion in depth. BXt the
most important Iactor in the development oI the religion  oI most people is
obvioXsly their  cXltXre. II we  are EXropean we are liNely  to believe  that
Christ was a white man, and iI we  are AIrican that he was a blacN man. II
one is an Indian  who was born  and raised in Benares or Bombay,  one is
liNely  to  become a  HindX  and  possess what has  been described  as a
pessimistic world view.  II one is  an American born and raised in  Indiana,
one is more  liNely to  become a Christian than a  HindX and to  possess a
somewhat more optimistic world view. :e   tend to believe what  the people
aroXnd Xs believe, and we tend to accept as trXth what these people tell Xs
oI the natXre oI the world as we listen to them dXring oXr Iormative years.
         BXt less obvioXs (e[cept to psychotherapists) is the Iact that the most
important part oI oXr cXltXre is oXr particXlar Iamily. The most basic cXltXre
in which  we develop is  the cXltXre oI  oXr Iamily, and  oXr parents are its
“cXltXre leaders.” Moreover, the most  signiIicant aspect oI  that cXltXre is
not what oXr parents tell Xs aboXt God and the natXre oI things bXt rather
what they do—how they behave toward each other, toward oXr siblings and,
above all, toward Xs. In other words, what we learn aboXt the natXre oI the
world when  we are growing Xp is  determined by the actXal natXre oI oXr
e[perience in  the  microcosm oI  the  Iamily.  It  is  not so  mXch what oXr
parents say that determines oXr world view as it  is the XniTXe world they
create Ior Xs by their behavior. “I agree that I have this notion oI a cXtthroat
God,”  Stewart said, “bXt  where did  it  come Irom?  My  parents certainly
believed in God—they talNed aboXt it incessantly—bXt theirs was a God oI

150
Love. JesXs loves Xs. God loves Xs. :e   love God  and JesXs. Love, love,
love, that’s all I ever heard.”
         “Did  yoX have a happy childhood?” I asNed.
         Stewart glared at  me. “Stop  playing  dXmb,” he said.  “YoX Nnow I
didn’t. YoX Nnow it was miserable.”
         “:hy    was it miserable?”
         “YoX Nnow that too. YoX Nnow what it was liNe. I got the shit beaten
oXt oI me.  Belts, boards, brooms, brXshes, anything they  coXld lay their
hands on. There wasn’t anything I coXld do that  didn’t  merit a beating. A
beating a day Neeps the doctor away and maNes a good little Christian oXt
oI yoX.”
         “Did  they ever try to strangle yoX or cXt yoXr throat?”
         “No,  bXt I’m  sXre they woXld have iI  I  hadn’t been careIXl.” There
was a long moment oI silence. Stewart’s Iace became e[tremely depressed.
Finally, heavily, he said, “I’m beginning to Xnderstand.”
         Stewart was not the only person who believed in what I have come to
call  the  “monster-god.”  I  have  had  a nXmber  oI  patients with   similar
concepts oI God and similarly bleaN or terriIying notions as to the natXre oI
e[istence. :hat   is sXrprising is that the monster-god is not more common in
the minds oI hXmans. In the Iirst section oI this booN it was noted that when
we are children oXr parents are godliNe IigXres to oXr child’s eye, and the
way  they do  things  seems the  way  they mXst  be done  throXghoXt the
Xniverse. OXr Iirst (and, sadly, oIten oXr only) notion oI  God’s natXre is a
simple e[trapolation   oI  oXr  parents’  natXres, a simple  blending  oI  the
characters oI oXr mothers and Iathers or their sXbstitXtes. II we have loving,
Iorgiving  parents, we are liNely to believe in  a loving  and Iorgiving  God.
And in oXr adXlt view the world is liNely to seem as nXrtXring a place as oXr
childhood was. II   oXr parents were harsh and  pXnitive, we  are liNely  to
matXre with a concept oI  a  harsh and pXnitive monster-god. And  iI  they
Iailed  to  care Ior  Xs, we  will   liNely  envision  the  Xniverse as similarly
Xncaring. *
         *  Frequently  (but  not always) the  essence of a patient’s childhood
and hence the essence of his or her world view is captured in the “earliest
memory.” Consequently I  will  often  ask patients, “Tell  me the  very first
thing that  you can remember.” They may protest that they cannot do this,
that they have a number of early memories. But when I force them to make

151
a choice of one, the response will vary in flavor from “Well, I remember my
mother picking  me up and carrying me outside in  her arms to show me a
beautiful sunset” to “I  remember sitting  on the floor  of the  kitchen. I  had
wet my pants and my mother was standing over me waving a big spoon in
the air and screaming at me.” It  is probable that these first memories, like
the  phenomenon  of  screen  memories,  which  they   so  often   are,  are
remembered precisely because they accurately symbolize the nature of  a
person’s early childhood. It is not  surprising, then, that  the flavor of these
earliest memories is so frequently  the same as that of  a patient’s deepest
feelings about the nature of existence.

         The Iact that oXr religion or world view is initially  largely  determined
by oXr XniTXe childhood e[perience brings  Xs Iace to Iace with  a central
problem: the relationship between religion and reality. It  is the problem oI
the microcosm  and  the  macrocosm. Stewart’s  view  oI  the  world   as a
dangeroXs place where he woXld get his throat cXt iI he wasn’t very careIXl
was perIectly realistic in terms oI the microcosm oI his childhood home; he
lived Xnder the domination  oI two  vicioXs adXlts. BXt all  parents are not
vicioXs and all adXlts are not vicioXs. In the larger world,  the macrocosm,
there are many  diIIerent  Ninds oI  parents and people  and societies and
cXltXres.
         To  develop  a  religion   or   world   view   that  is  realistic—that   is,
conIorms to the reality oI the cosmos and oXr role in it, as best we can Nnow
that reality—we  mXst constantly revise  and e[tend  oXr Xnderstanding to
inclXde new Nnowledge oI the larger world. :e mXst constantly enlarge oXr
Irame oI reIerence. :e  are dealing here with the issXes oI map-maNing and
transIerence, which were  discXssed at some  length in   the Iirst   section.
Stewart’s map oI reality was accXrate Ior the microcosm oI his Iamily,  bXt
he had transIerred that map inappropriately into a larger adXlt world, where
it was grossly incomplete and hence deIective. To some e[tent the religion
oI most adXlts is a prodXct oI transIerence.
         Most oI  Xs operate Irom a narrower Irame oI  reIerence than that oI
which we  are capable, Iailing to  transcend the inIlXence oI oXr particXlar
cXltXre, oXr particXlar set oI parents and oXr particXlar childhood e[perience
Xpon oXr Xnderstanding. It is no wonder, then, that the world oI hXmanity is
so IXll oI  conIlict.  :e   have a sitXation in which  hXman beings, who mXst

152
deal with each other, have vastly diIIerent views as to the natXre oI reality,
yet each one believes his or her own view to  be the correct one since it is
based on the  microcosm  oI  personal e[perience.  And  to  maNe matters
worse, most oI Xs are not even IXlly aware oI oXr own world views,  mXch
less the XniTXeness oI the e[perience Irom which they are derived. Bryant
:edge,   a psychiatrist  specializing  in  the Iield  oI   international relations,
stXdied negotiations between the United States and the U.S.S.R. and was
able to delineate a nXmber oI basic assXmptions as to the natXre oI hXman
beings and  society  and  the  world   held  by  Americans  which   diIIered
dramatically Irom the assXmptions oI RXssians. These assXmptions dictated
the negotiating behavior oI both sides. Yet neither side was aware oI its own
assXmptions or the Iact that the other side was operating on a diIIerent set oI
assXmptions. The inevitable resXlt was that the negotiating behavior oI the
RXssians seemed to the Americans to be either crazy or deliberately evil,
and oI coXrse the Americans seemed to the RXssians eTXally crazy or evil. *

         :e   are indeed liNe the three proverbial blind men, each in toXch with
only his  particXlar piece  oI  the elephant yet  each claiming  to Nnow  the
natXre oI the whole beast. So we sTXabble over oXr diIIerent microcosmic
world views, and all wars are holy wars.

         The  Religion     of   Science


         SpiritXal  growth  is  a MoXrney oXt oI the  microcosm  into  an  ever
greater macrocosm. In its  earlier stages (which  is all  this  booN concerns
itselI with)  it is a MoXrney oI Nnowledge and not oI Iaith. In order to escape
the  microcosm  oI   oXr  previoXs  e[perience   and  Iree  oXrselves  Irom
transIerences, it is necessary that we learn. :e mXst continXally e[pand oXr
realm oI Nnowledge and oXr Iield oI vision throXgh the thoroXgh digestion

153
and  incorporation  oI   new  inIormation.   The   process oI   e[pansion  oI
Nnowledge has been a maMor theme oI this booN. It will be recalled that in
the  previoXs  section  love  was   deIined  as  an  e[tension—that   is,   an
e[pansion—oI oXrselves, and it was noted that among the risNs oI love was
the risN oI moving into the XnNnown oI new e[perience. And at the end oI
the  Iirst  section  on  discipline   it  was  also  noted  that  the  learning  oI
something new reTXires a giving Xp oI the old selI and a death oI oXtworn
Nnowledge. To develop a broader vision we mXst be willing to  IorsaNe, to
Nill, oXr narrower vision. In  the short rXn it is  more comIortable not to do
this—to stay where we  are, to Neep Xsing the same microcosmic map, to
avoid sXIIering the death oI cherished notions. The road oI spiritXal growth,
however, lies in  the opposite direction.  :e   begin  by distrXsting what  we
already believe,  by  actively  seeNing the threatening  and XnIamiliar,  by
deliberately challenging  the  validity   oI  what  we  have  previoXsly  been
taXght and  hold   dear. The   path  to  holiness  lies   throXgh TXestioning
eYerything.
         In a very real sense, we begin with science. :e begin by replacing the
religion oI  oXr parents with the religion  oI science. :e   mXst rebel against
and reMect the religion oI oXr parents, Ior inevitably their world view will be
narrower than that oI which we are capable iI we taNe IXll advantage oI oXr
personal e[perience, inclXding oXr adXlt e[perience and the e[perience oI
an additional generation oI hXman history. There is no sXch thing as a good
hand-me-down religion. To be vital, to be the best oI which we are capable,
oXr religion mXst be a wholly personal one, Iorged entirely throXgh the Iire
oI oXr TXestioning and doXbting in the crXcible oI  oXr own e[perience oI
reality. As the theologian Alan Jones has said:

                One oI  oXr problems is that very Iew  oI Xs have developed any
       distinctive  personal liIe. Everything aboXt Xs seems secondhand, even
       oXr  emotions.   In   many  cases we   have  to   rely   on  secondhand
       inIormation  in  order to IXnction.  I accept the word  oI  a physician, a
       scientist, a Iarmer, on trXst. I do not  liNe to do this. I  have to becaXse
       they  possess vital   Nnowledge oI   living   oI  which   I   am  ignorant.
       Secondhand inIormation   concerning  the  state oI   my  Nidneys, the
       eIIects oI cholesterol, and the raising oI chicNens, I can live with.  BXt
       when   it   comes  to   TXestions  oI   meaning,  pXrpose,  and   death,

154
       secondhand inIormation will  not do. I cannot sXrvive on a secondhand
       Iaith  in a secondhand God. There has to be a personal word, a XniTXe
       conIrontation, iI  I am to come alive. *
         * Journey Into  Christ (New York: Seabury Press, 1977), pp. 91-92.

         So Ior mental health and spiritXal  growth we mXst develop oXr own
personal religion and not rely on that oI oXr parents. BXt what is this aboXt a
“religion  oI  science”? Science is a religion  becaXse it is a world  view oI
considerable comple[ity   with  a  nXmber oI  maMor tenets. Most oI  these
maMor tenets are as Iollows: the Xniverse is real, and thereIore a valid obMect
Ior e[amination;  it  is oI  valXe Ior hXman beings to e[amine  the Xniverse;
the Xniverse maNes sense—that is, it Iollows certain laws and is predictable;
bXt  hXman beings  are   poor  e[aminers,   sXbMect to sXperstition,  bias,
preMXdice, and a proIoXnd tendency to see what they want to see rather than
what  is  really   there;  conseTXently, to  e[amine  and  hence  Xnderstand
accXrately, it is necessary Ior hXman beings to  sXbMect themselves to the
discipline oI scientiIic  method. The essence oI this discipline is e[perience,
so that we cannot consider oXrselves to Nnow something Xnless we have
actXally e[perienced  it;  while  the  discipline  oI  scientiIic  method begins
with e[perience, simple e[perience itselI  is not to  be trXsted; to be trXsted,
e[perience  mXst be  repeatable, XsXally in  the  Iorm   oI  an  e[periment;
moreover, the e[perience mXst be veriIiable, in that other people mXst have
the same e[perience Xnder the same circXmstances.
         The Ney words are “reality,” “e[amination,”   “Nnowledge,” “distrXst,”
“e[perience,”  “discipline.”  These are words we have been Xsing all along.
Science is a religion oI  sNepticism. To escape Irom the microcosm oI oXr
childhood e[perience, Irom  the microcosm oI  oXr cXltXre and its dogmas,
Irom the halI-trXths oXr parents told Xs, it is essential that we be sNeptical
aboXt what we thinN we have learned to date. It is the scientiIic attitXde that
enables Xs to transIorm oXr personal e[perience oI  the microcosm into  a
personal e[perience  oI   the  macrocosm. :e     mXst begin  by   becoming
scientists. Many patients who have already taNen this beginning say to me:
“I’m  not religioXs. I  don’t go to  chXrch. I no longer believe mXch oI what
the chXrch and my parents told me. I don’t have my parents’ Iaith. I  gXess
I’m  not very spiritXal.”  It oIten comes as a shocN to them when I TXestion
the reality oI their assXmption that they are not spiritXal beings. “YoX have a

155
religion,”  I  may say, “a  rather proIoXnd one. YoX worship the  trXth. YoX
believe in the possibility  oI yoXr growth  and betterment: the possibility oI
spiritXal progress. In the strength oI yoXr religion yoX are willing  to sXIIer
the pains oI challenge and the agonies oI Xnlearning. YoX taNe the risN oI
therapy, and all this  yoX do Ior  the saNe oI yoXr religion.  I am  not at all
certain it is realistic  to say that yoX are less spiritXal than yoXr parents; to
the contrary, I sXspect the reality is that yoX have spiritXally evolved beyond
yoXr parents, that yoXr spiritXality is greater by a TXantXm leap than theirs,
which is insXIIicient to provide them with even the coXrage to TXestion.”
         One  thing   to  sXggest  that  science  as  a  religion   represents an
improvement, an evolXtionary leap, over a nXmber oI other world views, is
its international character. :e speaN oI the worldwide scientiIic commXnity.
And it  is  beginning to approach a trXe commXnity, to  come considerably
closer than the Catholic ChXrch, which is probably the ne[t closest thing to
a trXe international brotherhood. Scientists oI all  lands are able, Iar better
than most oI the rest oI Xs, to talN to each other. To some e[tent they have
been sXccessIXl in transcending the microcosm oI their  cXltXre. To some
e[tent they are becoming wise.
         To some e[tent. :hile    I  believe that the sNeptical world view oI  the
scientiIic-minded is a distinct  improvement over a world  view based Xpon
blind Iaith,  local sXperstition and XnTXestioned assXmptions, I also believe
that most oI  the scientiIic-minded  have only barely  begXn the MoXrney oI
spiritXal growth. SpeciIically, I  believe that the oXtlooN oI most scientiIic-
minded people toward  the  reality  oI  God  is  almost as parochial  as the
oXtlooN oI simple  peasants who blindly  Iollow  the  Iaith oI  their  Iathers.
Scientists have grave diIIicXlty dealing with the reality oI God.
         :hen    we looN Irom  oXr vantage oI  sophisticated sNepticism at the
phenomenon oI belieI in God we are not impressed. :e see dogmatism, and
proceeding Irom dogmatism, we see wars and inTXisitions and persecXtions.
:e   see hypocrisy: people proIessing the brotherhood oI  man Nilling their
Iellows in  the name oI Iaith,  lining  their pocNets at the e[pense oI others,
and practicing all manner oI brXtality. :e   see a bewildering mXltiplicity  oI
ritXals and images withoXt consensXs: this god is a woman with si[   arms
and si[ legs; that is a man who sits on a throne; this one is an elephant; that
one the   essence oI  nothingness;  pantheons, hoXsehold gods,  trinities,
Xnities. :e  see ignorance, sXperstition, rigidity. The tracN record Ior belieI

156
in God  looNs pretty poor. It  is  tempting to  thinN that hXmanity might  be
better oII withoXt a belieI in God, that God is not only pie in the sNy by and
by, bXt a poisoned pie at that.  It woXld  seem reasonable to conclXde that
God is an illXsion in the minds oI hXmans—a destrXctive illXsion—and that
belieI in God is a common Iorm  oI hXman psychopathology that shoXld be
healed. So  we  have  a TXestion:  Is  belieI  in   God  a  sicNness? Is it  a
maniIestation oI transIerence—a concept oI oXr parents, derived Irom the
microcosm, inappropriately  proMected into the macrocosm? Or, to  pXt it
another way, is sXch belieI a Iorm oI  primitive  or childish  thinNing which
we shoXld grow oXt oI as we seeN higher levels oI awareness and matXrity?
:e   want to be scientiIic in attempting to answer this TXestion, it is essential
that we tXrn to  the reality  oI  actXal clinical  data. :hat    happens to one’s
belieI in God as one grows throXgh the process oI psychotherapy?

         The  Case   of  Kathy


         Kathy was the most Irightened person I have ever seen. :hen I came
into  her room  that Iirst   time  she was sitting  on  the Iloor   in  the comer
mXttering what soXnded liNe a chant. She looNed Xp at me standing in the
doorway and her eyes grew wide with terror. She wailed and pXshed herselI
bacN into the comer and Nept straining against the walls as iI she wished she
coXld pXsh herselI throXgh them. I said, “Kathy, I’m a psychiatrist. I’m not
going to hXrt yoX.” I  tooN a chair, sat down at some distance Irom her and
waited. For another minXte she continXed to pXsh herselI into  the comer.
Then she began to rela[,  bXt  only enoXgh to start  weeping inconsolably.
AIter a while her weeping stopped and she began to chant to herselI again. I
asNed her what was  wrong. “I’m    going to  die,”   she blXrted oXt hardly
paXsing to interrXpt the cadence oI her chant. There was nothing more she
coXld tell rile. She continXed to chant. Every Iive minXtes or so she woXld
stop, seemingly e[haXsted, whimper Ior a Iew moments, and, then resXme
her chanting. To whatever TXestion I asNed she woXld respond only with
“I’m  going to die,”  never breaNing the rhythm oI the chant. It seemed that”
she Ielt she might be able to prevent her death by this chanting and coXld
not allow herselI to rest or sleep.

157
         From  her  hXsband, Howard,  a  yoXng  policeman,  I  obtained  the
minimal Iacts. Kathy was twenty years old. They had been married Ior two
years. There were no problems with the marriage. Kathy  was close to her
parents. She had never had any psychiatric  diIIicXlty  beIore.  This was a
complete sXrprise. She had been perIectly Iine that morning. She had driven
him to  worN. Two hoXrs later his sister called him.  She had gone to visit
Kathy and  had IoXnd her in  this  condition. They  had broXght her to  the
hospital. No, she had not been acting strange lately. E[cept maybe Ior one
thing. For  aboXt IoXr months she had seemed TXite IearIXl oI going  into
pXblic places. To help her Howard had been doing all the shopping in  the
sXpermarNet while she waited in the car. She also seemed to be aIraid oI
being leIt: alone. She prayed a lot—bXt, then, she had done that ever since
he had Nnown her. Her Iamily was TXite religioXs. Her mother went to mass
at least twice a weeN. FXnny thing—Kathy  had stopped going to mass as
soon as they were  married. :hich    was  MXst Iine with him.  BXt she still
prayed a lot. Her physical health? Oh, that was e[cellent. She’d never been
hospitalized. Fainted once at a wedding several years ago. Contraception?
She tooN the pill. :ait   a minXte. AboXt a month ago she told him she was
stopping the pill. She’d read aboXt how it was dangeroXs or something. He
hadn’t thoXght mXch aboXt it.
         I gave Kathy  massive amoXnts oI tranTXilizers and sedatives so that
she was able to sleep at night, bXt dXring the ne[t  two  days her behavior
remained Xnchanged: incessant chanting, inability to commXnicate anything
e[cept the conviction oI her imminent death, and Xnremitting terror. Finally,
on the IoXrth  day, I gave her  an intravenoXs inMection oI sodiXm amytal.
“This inMection is going to maNe yoX sleepy Kathy,” I said, “bXt yoX will not
Iall asleep. Nor will   yoX die. It  will  maNe yoX able to stop chanting. YoX
will  Ieel very rela[ed.  YoX will  be able to talN with  me. I want yoX to tell
me what happened the morning yoX came to the hospital.”
         “Nothing happened,” Kathy answered.
         “YoX drove yoXr hXsband to worN?”
         “Yes. Then I drove home. Then I Nnew I was going to die.”
         “YoX drove home MXst as yoX do every morning aIter yoX drop yoXr
hXsband at worN?”
         Kathy began to chant again.

158
         “Stop chanting,  Kathy,”  I ordered. “YoX’re  completely  saIe. YoX’re
Ieeling very  rela[ed.  Something was  diIIerent  aboXt the way  yoX drove
home that morning. YoX are going to tell me what was diIIerent.”
         “I  tooN a diIIerent road.”
         “:hy    did yoX do that?”
         “I  tooN the road past Bill’s hoXse.”
         “:ho’s    Bill?”  I asNed.
         Kathy started chanting once more.
         “Is Bill  a boyIriend oI yoXrs?”
         “He was. BeIore I got married.”
         “YoX miss Bill a lot, don’t yoX?”
         Kathy wailed, “Oh, God, I’m  going to die.”
         “Did  yoX see Bill that day?”
         “No.”
         “BXt yoX wanted to see him?”
         “I’m  going to die,” Kathy replied.
         “Do  yoX Ieel that God is going to pXnish yoX Ior wanting to see Bill
again?”
         “Yes.”
         “That’s why yoX believe yoX’re going to die?”
         “Yes.”  Once more  Kathy  started chanting.  I  let  her  chant Ior  ten
minXtes while I collected my thoXghts. .
         Finally I  said to her, “Kathy, yoX believe yoX are going to die becaXse
yoX believe yoX Nnow the mind oI God. BXt yoX are wrong. BecaXse yoX do
not Nnow the mind oI God. All yoX Nnow is what yoX have been told aboXt
God. MXch oI what yoX have been told aboXt God is wrong. I do not Nnow
everything aboXt God, bXt I  Nnow more  than yoX do  and more than the
people who have told yoX aboXt God. For instance, every day I see men and
women, liNe yoXrselI, who want to be XnIaithIXl, and some are, and they are
not pXnished by God. I Nnow, becaXse they Neep coming bacN to see me.
And  talN with  me.  And  they become happier.  JXst as yoX will   become
happier. BecaXse we are going to worN together. And yoX are going to learn
that yoX’re not  a bad  person. And yoX’re  going  to learn  the trXth aboXt
yoXrselI and aboXt God. And yoX will become happier, aboXt yoXrselI and
aboXt liIe. BXt now yoX’re going to sleep. And when yoX awaNe yoX will no
longer be aIraid that yoX’re going to die. And  when yoX see me tomorrow

159
morning again, yoX will be able to talN with me, and we will talN aboXt God
and we will talN aboXt yoXrselI. “
         In  the morning  Kathy  was improved.  She was still   Irightened and
Xnconvinced that she woXld not die, bXt no longer certain that she woXld.
Slowly, on that day and Ior many, many days thereaIter, her story emerged,
piece by piece. DXring her senior year  in high  school she had had se[Xal
intercoXrse with Howard. He wanted to marry her and she had agreed. Two
weeNs later while at the wedding oI a Iriend, the idea sXddenly came to her
that she  did  not  want  to  get married.  She  Iainted.  AIterward  she was
conIXsed as to whether she loved Howard. BXt she Ielt that she had to go
throXgh with  the marriage becaXse she Nnew she had already sinned by
having premarital relations with him and this sin woXld be magniIied iI she
did not  consecrate their relationship  in marriage.  Still,  she did  not want
children, at least not Xntil she Ielt more certain that she loved Howard. So
she started on the pill—another sin. She coXld not bear to conIess these sins
and was relieved to stop going to mass aIter they were married. She enMoyed
se[ with  Howard. Almost  Irom the day oI  their wedding, however, he lost
interest in her  se[Xally. He  remained an ideal provider,  bXying her  giIts,
treating her deIerentially, worNing a great deal oI overtime, not allowing her
to have a Mob. BXt she almost had to beg him Ior se[, and the se[ they had
every  two  weeNs was  aboXt all   there  was to   relieve  her  Xnremitting
boredom. Divorce was oXt; that was a sin, XnthinNable.
         Despite herselI Kathy began to have Iantasies oI se[Xal inIidelity. She
thoXght perhaps she might rid herselI oI these iI  she prayed more, so she
started to pray ritXalistically Iive minXtes every hoXr. Then Howard noticed
and teased her aboXt it. So she decided to hide her praying by doing it more
in the daytime when Howard was not home, to maNe Xp Ior not doing it in
the  evening when   he  was. This   meant  she had  to   pray  either  more
IreTXently or Iaster. She decided to  do both.  She prayed now every  halI
hoXr, and in her Iive  minXtes oI praying time  she doXbled her speed. The
Iantasies oI inIidelity continXed, however, and gradXally became even more
IreTXent and insistent. :henever she went oXtside she looNed at men. That
made things worse. She became IearIXl oI going oXtside with Howard, and
even when she was with him, she became Irightened oI pXblic places where
she might see men. She thoXght perhaps she oXght to retXrn to chXrch. BXt
then she realized that iI she retXrned to chXrch she woXld be sinning iI she

160
did not go to conIession and conIess her Iantasies oI inIidelity to the priest.
This she coXld  not do.  She again doXbled the  speed oI her  praying. To
Iacilitate this  she began to develop an elaborate system in which a single
chanted syllable stood Ior an entire particXlar prayer. This was the genesis
oI her chanting. In a while,  perIecting her system, she was able to chant a
thoXsand prayers in a Iive-minXte period. Initially,  while  she was so bXsy
perIecting her chanting, the Iantasies oI inIidelity seemed to abate, bXt once
she had the system down pat they retXrned IXll Iorce. She began to consider
how she might actXally carry them oXt. She thoXght oI calling Bill, her old
boyIriend. She thoXght oI bars she might go to  in the  aIternoon. TerriIied
that she might really do this, she stopped taNing the pill, hoping that the Iear
oI getting pregnant woXld help her in resisting sXch acts. BXt the desire Nept
growing stronger. One aIternoon she IoXnd herselI starting to  mastXrbate.
She was horriIied.  That was perhaps the worst sin  oI all.  She’d  heard oI
cold showers and tooN one as cold as she coXld stand. It helped her Xntil
Howard came home. BXt the ne[t day it was all bacN again.
         Finally, that last morning, she gave in. AIter  dropping Howard oII  at
worN she drove  directly  to  Bill’s  hoXse. She parNed right  in  Iront.  She
waited. Nothing happened. No one seemed to be home. She got oXt oI the
car and stood leaning against it, in a sedXctive pose. “Please,” she pleaded
silently, “please let  Bill   see me, please let him  notice me.”  Still  nothing
happened. “Please let someone see me, anyone. I’ve got to IXcN someone.
Oh, God, I’m a whore. I’m  the :hore   oI Babylon. O God, Nill me, I’ve  got
to die.”  She MXmped in the car and raced bacN to the apartment. She got a
razor blade and went to cXt her wrist. She coXld not do it. BXt God coXld.
God woXld. God woXld give her what she deserved. He woXld pXt an end to
it, an end to her. Let the vigil begin. “O  God, I’m  so scared, I’m so scared,
please hXrry, I’m so scared.” She began to chant, waiting. And that was how
her sister-in-law IoXnd her.
         This story was elicited in its entirety only aIter months oI painstaNing
worN. MXch oI this worN centered aroXnd the concept oI sin. :here did she
learn that mastXrbation is a sin? :ho had told her it was a sin? How did her
inIormant  Nnow it  was  a sin?  :hat    made mastXrbation a  sin? :hy     is
inIidelity  a sin? :hat    maNes a sin? And so on,  and so on. I  Nnow oI  no
proIession  more  e[citing    and   more  privileged   than   the  practice   oI
psychotherapy, bXt at times it may be almost tedioXs as the attitXdes oI a

161
liIetime  are methodically  challenged one  by one  in  all  their  particXlars.
OIten sXch challenge is  at least partly  sXccessIXl even beIore the whole
story emerges. For instance, Kathy was able to tell me aboXt many oI these
details, sXch as her Iantasies and her temptation to mastXrbation, only aIter
she herselI  had  begXn  to  TXestion the  validity    oI  her  gXilt   and  her
conception oI  these acts as  sins. In  raising  these TXestions it  was also
necessary that she TXestion the validity oI the aXthority and wisdom oI the
whole Catholic ChXrch, or at least the chXrch as she had e[perienced it. One
does not taNe on the Catholic ChXrch easily. She coXld do so only becaXse
she had the strength oI an ally  in me, becaXse she had gradXally come to
Ieel that I  was trXly  on her side,  trXly had her best interests at heart and
woXld not lead her into evil.  This “therapeXtic alliance,” sXch as she and I
had  slowly    constrXcted  is   a   prereTXisite  Ior   all    sXccessIXl maMor
psychotherapy.
         MXch oI this  worN was condXcted on an oXtpatient basis. Kathy had
been able to be discharged Irom the hospital a weeN Iollowing her sodiXm
amytal interview. BXt it was only aIter IoXr months oI intensive therapy that
she was able to say in  regard to her notions oI  sin, “I  gXess the Catholic
ChXrch sold me a bill oI goods.” At  this point  a new phase oI therapy was
begXn, Ior  we  began  to  asN the  TXestion: How   was  it  that   this  had
happened? :hy   had she allowed  herselI to  bXy this  bill  oI  goods, locN,
stocN and barrel? How was it that she had not been able to thinN more Ior
herselI and had  not Xntil  now  challenged the  chXrch in  any way?  “BXt
Mother told me I  shoXld not TXestion the chXrch,” Kathy said. And so we
began to worN on  Kathy’s  relationship with  her parents. :ith     her Iather
there was no relationship. There was no one to relate to. Father worNed; that
was all he did. He worNed and he worNed, and when he came home it was
to sleep in his chair  with his  beer. E[cept on Friday nights.  Then he went
oXt   Ior    his   beer.   Mother    ran   the   Iamily.    Alone,    Xnchallenged,
Xncontradicted, Xnopposed, she ran it. She  was Nind bXt  Iirm.  She was
giving bXt never gave in.  PeaceIXl and implacable. “YoX mXstn’t do that,
dear. Good girls don’t do that.” “YoX don’t  want to wear those shoes, dear.
Girls Irom nice homes don’t wear those Nind oI shoes.” “It isn’t  a TXestion
oI whether yoX want to go to mass, dear. The Lord wants Xs to go to mass.”
GradXally Kathy came to see that behind the power oI the Catholic ChXrch

162
lay the  enormoXs power oI her  mother, a person so soItly   yet so totally
domineering that it seemed XnthinNable to deIy her.
         BXt psychotherapy seldom goes smoothly. Si[  months aIter she had
leIt the hospital Howard called one SXnday morning to say that Kathy was
locNed in the bathroom oI their  apartment chanting once again. Upon my
instrXctions he persXaded her to retXrn to the hospital, where I met them.
Kathy  was almost as  Irightened as  the Iirst  day  I  saw her.  Once again
Howard had no clXe as to what had set it oII.  I tooN Kathy into  her room.
“Stop chanting,” I ordered, “and tell me what’s the matter.”
         “I  can’t.”
         “Yes, yoX can, Kathy.”
         Hardly  catching her breath in  between her chanting, she sXggested,
“Maybe I can iI yoX give me the trXth drXg again.”
         “No,  Kathy,”   I  replied. “This   time  yoX’re strong  enoXgh to  do It
yoXrselI.”
         She wailed. Then she looNed at me and resXmed her chanting. BXt in
her looN I thoXght I detected anger, almost IXry, at me.
         “YoX’re angry at me,” I stated.
         She shooN her head as she chanted
         “Kathy,”  I  said, “I  can thinN oI  a dozen reasons why yoX might  be
angry at me. BXt I don’t Nnow Xnless yoX tell me. YoX can tell me. It will be
all right.”
         “I’m  going to die,” she moaned.
         “No, yoX’re not, Kathy. YoX’re not going to die becaXse yoX’re angry
at me. I’m not going to Nill yoX becaXse yoX’re angry at me. It’s all right Ior
yoX to be angry at me.”
         “My  days are not long,” Kathy moaned. “My days are not long.”
         Something aboXt these words soXnded strange to me. They were not
the words I woXld have e[pected. Somehow they seemed XnnatXral. BXt I
was not sXre what to say e[cept to repeat myselI one way or another.
         “Kathy,  I love  yoX,” I  said. “I  love yoX even iI  yoX hate me. That’s
what love is. How coXld I pXnish yoX Ior hating me, since I love yoX, hating
and all?”
         “It’s  not yoX I hate,” she sobbed.
         SXddenly it clicNed. “YoXr days are not long. Not long on this  earth.
That’s it, isn’t it,  Kathy? Honor yoXr mother and yoXr Iather that yoXr days

163
may be long on  this earth. The FiIth  Commandment. Honor  them or die.
That’s what’s happening, isn’t it?”
         “I  hate her,” Kathy  mXttered. Then loXder, as iI emboldened by the
soXnd oI her own voice  saying the dreaded words, “I  hate her. I hate my
mother. I hate her. She never gave me... she never gave me... she never gave
me me. She never let me be me. She made me in her image. She made me,
made me, made me. She never let any oI me be me.”
         ActXally, Kathy’s therapy was still in its early stages. The real day-to-
day terror still lay ahead, the terror oI being trXly herselI in a thoXsand little
ways. Recognizing  the Iact  that  her  mother  had totally  dominated  her,
Kathy then had to deal with why she had allowed this to happen. ReMecting
her mother’s domination,  she had to Iace  the process oI establishing her
own valXes and maNing her own decisions, and she was very Irightened. It
was mXch saIer to let her mother maNe the decisions, mXch simpler to adopt
her mother’s valXes and those oI the chXrch. It  tooN mXch more worN to
direct her own  e[istence. Later Kathy  was to say, “YoX Nnow, I  woXldn’t
really trade places Ior anything with the person I Xsed to be, yet sometimes
I still long Ior  those days. My liIe Xsed to be easier then. At least in a way.”
         Beginning to IXnction more independently, Kathy conIronted Howard
with his IailXre as a lover. Howard promised he woXld change. BXt nothing
happened. Kathy pressed him.  He began to  get  an[iety  attacNs. On my
Xrging, when he came to me aboXt these, he went to another psychotherapist
Ior  treatment. He  started to deal  with  deep-seated homose[Xal Ieelings,
against which he had deIended himselI by his marriage to Kathy. BecaXse
she was very physically attractive he had regarded her as a “real catch,” a
prize the  winning  oI  which   woXld prove  to  himselI  and  the world   his
mascXline competence. In  a  meaningIXl  way  he  had never  loved  her.
Having  come to  accept this,  he  and Kathy  most  amicably  agreed to  a
divorce. Kathy went to worN as a saleswoman in a large clothing store. :ith
me she agonized over the innXmerable small bXt independent decisions she
was reTXired to maNe in connection with  her  Mob. GradXally she became
more assertive and  conIident. She  dated many  men, intending  eventXal
remarriage and motherhood, bXt Ior the time being enMoying her career. She
became an assistant bXyer Ior the store. AIter terminating therapy she was
promoted to bXyer, and most recently I heard Irom her that she had moved
to another larger  Iirm  in  the same capacity, and  was TXite pleased with

164
herselI at the age oI twenty-seven. She does not go to chXrch and no longer
considers herselI a Catholic.  She doesn’t Nnow whether  .she believes in
God or not, bXt will tell  yoX IranNly that the issXe oI God MXst doesn’t seem
a very important one at this point in her liIe.
         I have .described Kathy’s case at sXch length precisely becaXse it is so
typical    oI     the     relationship    between    religioXs    Xpbringing    and
psychopathology. There are millions oI  Kathys. I  Xsed to tell people only
somewhat IacetioXsly that the Catholic ChXrch provided me with my living
as a  psychiatrist.  I   coXld eTXally  well   have said  the  Baptist  ChXrch,
LXtheran ChXrch, Presbyterian ChXrch, or any other. The chXrch was not, oI
coXrse, the sole caXse oI Kathy’s neXrosis. In a sense the chXrch was only a
tool Xsed by Kathy’s mother to cement and aXgment her e[cessive parental
aXthority. One coXld MXstiIiably say that the mother’s domineering natXre,
abetted by an absentee Iather, was the more basic caXse oI the neXrosis, and
in this respect too Kathy’s  case was typical. Nonetheless, the chXrch mXst
share the blame.  No  nXn in  her  parochial  school and  no  priest  in  her
catechism class ever encoXraged Kathy to  reasonably TXestion religioXs
doctrine or in any way  whatever to thinN Ior herselI. There was never any
evidence oI concern on  the part oI  the chXrch that  its doctrine  might  be
overtaXght, Xnrealistically rigid  or  sXbMect to misXse and misapplication.
One way oI  analyzing Kathy’s  problem  woXld be to  state that while  she
believed wholeheartedly in God, the commandments and the concept oI sin,
her religion  and  Xnderstanding oI  the world  was  oI  the  hand-me-down
variety  and badly   sXited to  her  needs. She  had Iailed   to  TXestion, to
challenge, to thinN Ior herselI. Yet Kathy’s chXrch—and this also is typical
—made not   the  slightest  eIIort  to   assist her  in   worNing  oXt a  more
appropriate and original  personal religion.  It  woXld appear that chXrches
generally, iI anything, Iavor the hand-me-down variety.
         BecaXse Kathy’s case is so typical and others liNe it are so common in
their practice, many psychiatrists and psychotherapists perceive religion as
the enemy. They .may even thinN oI religion  as being itselI a neXrosis—a
collection oI inherently irrational ideas that serve to enchain people’s minds
and oppress their instincts toward mental growth.  FreXd, a rationalist and
scientist par e[cellence, seemed to see things in roXghly this light, and since
he is  the  most inIlXential  IigXre  in  modern  psychiatry  (Ior  many  good
reasons), his attitXdes have  contribXted to  the  concept oI  religion  as  a

165
neXrosis. It  is  indeed tempting  Ior  psychiatrists  to  view  themselves as
Nnights oI  modern science locNed in  noble combat  with  the  destrXctive
Iorces oI   ancient  religioXs  sXperstition and  irrational  bXt  aXthoritarian
dogma.  And  the  Iact  oI the  matter is  that  psychotherapists mXst spend
enormoXs amoXnts oI  time  and  eIIort  in  the  strXggle  to  liberate  their
patients’ minds Irom oXtdated religioXs ideas and concepts that are clearly
destrXctive.

         The  Case   of  Marcia


         BXt not all cases are liNe Kathy’s by any means. There are many other
patterns, some also TXite common. Marcia was one oI the very Iirst oI my
long-term-therapy cases. She was a TXite wealthy yoXng woman in her mid-
twenties who  soXght my  attention  becaXse oI a  generalized anhedonia.
:hile    she coXld not pXt her Iinger on anything wrong  with  her e[istence,
she IoXnd it ine[plicably  Moyless. Certainly she looNed Moyless. Despite her
wealth  and  her   college  edXcation  she  looNed liNe  an   impoverished,
bedraggled and  aged immigrant   woman.  ThroXghoXt the  Iirst   year oI
therapy she invariably dressed in badly Iitting clothes oI blXe, gray, blacN or
brown, and carried with  her an  enormoXs, Iilthy and ragged carpetbag oI
similar  hXe. She was the  only  child  oI  intellectXal  parents, both highly
sXccessIXl Xniversity proIessors, both socialists oI a sort who believed that
religion was “pie in the sNy by and by.” They had made IXn oI her when, as
a yoXng adolescent, she had attended chXrch with a girl Iriend. By the time
she entered therapy, Marcia agreed with her parents wholeheartedly. At the
very beginning she annoXnced, somewhat proXdly and stridently, that she
was an atheist—not a namby-pamby atheist bXt a real one, who  believed
that the hXman race woXld be mXch better oII iI  it  coXld escape Irom the
delXsion that  God  e[isted   or  even might   e[ist.   Interestingly,  Marcia’s
dreams were chocN-IXll  oI  religioXs symbols,  sXch as birds  Ilying   into
rooms, their  beaNs holding  scrolls  Xpon which  obscXre messages were
written  in  an ancient langXage. BXt I  did  not  conIront  Marcia with   this
aspect oI her XnconscioXs. Indeed, we did  not deal  at all  with  issXes oI
religion at any time throXghoXt the two-year coXrse oI her therapy. :hat we
primarily  IocXsed on at great length was her relationship with her parents,

166
two most intelligent and rational individXals who had provided well Ior  her
economically bXt were e[traordinarily distant Irom  her emotionally in their
intellectXally aXstere way. In addition to  their emotional  distance, both oI
them were also so highly invested in  their own careers that they had little
time or energy Ior her. The resXlt was that while she had a comIortable and
intact   home,  Marcia   was   the   proverbial   “poor   little    rich   girl,”    a
psychological orphan. BXt she was relXctant to looN at this. She resented it
when I  sXggested that her parents had signiIicantly deprived her and  she
resented it when I pointed oXt that she dressed liNe an orphan. It was MXst
the new style, she said, and I had no right to criticize it.
         Progress with Marcia in therapy was painIXlly gradXal, bXt dramatic.
The Ney element was the warmth and closeness. oI the relationship that we
were slowly  able to  constrXct with each other  which contrasted with  the
relationship she had had with her parents. One morning at the beginning oI
the second year oI therapy  Marcia came into  her session carrying a new
bag. It was bXt a third the size oI her old carpetbag and was a riot oI bright
colors. ThereaIter aboXt once each month she woXld add a  new piece oI
color—bright  oranges, yellows, light  blXes and greens—to her wardrobe,
almost liNe a Ilower slowly  XnIolding its petals. In  her ne[t-to-last session
with me she was mXsing aboXt how well she Ielt and said, “YoX Nnow, it’s
strange, bXt not only has the inside oI  me changed; everything oXtside oI
me seems to have changed too. Even thoXgh I’m  still  here, living   in the
same old hoXse and doing .some oI the same old things, the whole world
looNs very diIIerent, Ieels very diIIerent. It Ieels warm and saIe and loving
and e[citing and good. I remember telling yoX I was an atheist. I’m not sXre
I am any more. In Iact, I don’t  thinN I am. Sometimes now when the world
Ieels right, I  say to myselI, ‘YoX Nnow, I bet there really is  a God. I don’t
thinN the world coXld be so right withoXt  a God.’ It’s  IXnny. I don’t  Nnow
how to talN aboXt this sort oI thing. I MXst Ieel connected, real, liNe I’m a real
part oI a very big pictXre, and even thoXgh I can’t see mXch oI the pictXre, I
Nnow it’s there and I Nnow it’s good and I Nnow I’m a part oI it.”
         ThroXgh therapy Kathy moved Irom a place where the notion oI God
was all-important to a place where it was oI no importance. Marcia, on the
other hand, moved Irom a position where she reMected the notion oI God to
one where it was becoming TXite meaningIXl Ior her. The same process, the
same therapist, yet with seemingly opposite resXlts, both sXccessIXl. How

167
are we to  e[plain  this?  BeIore we  attempt to  do  so, let  Xs consider yet
another type oI case. In Kathy’s  case it was necessary Ior the therapist to
actively challenge her religioXs ideas in order to bring aboXt change in the
direction oI a dramatically  diminished inIlXence oI the God-concept in her
liIe. In the case oI Marcia the concept oI God began to assXme an increased
inIlXence, bXt withoXt the therapist ever challenging her religioXs concepts
in any  way. Is  it  ever necessary, we may asN, Ior a therapist  to actively
challenge a  patient’s  atheism or   agnosticism and  deliberately  lead  the
patient in the direction oI religiosity?

         The  Case   of  Theodore


         Ted was  thirty  when  he  came to  see me,  and  a hermit.  For  the
preceding seven years he had lived in a small cabin deep m the woods. He
had Iew  Iriends  and  no  one  close. For  three  years he  had  not  dated.
Occasionally he perIormed minor  carpentry Mobs, bXt mostly he Iilled his
days by Iishing,  reading  and spending endless time maNing Xnimportant
decisions, sXch as what he woXld cooN Ior dinner and how he might cooN it
or whether he coXld or  coXld not aIIord  to  pXrchase an ine[pensive tool.
ActXally, by  virtXe oI  an inheritance  he was TXite wealthy.  He was also
intellectXally brilliant.  And, as he said that Iirst session, paralyzed. “I Nnow
I shoXld be doing something more constrXctive and creative with my liIe,”
he complained, “bXt I can’t even maNe the most minor decisions, mXch less
big ones. I oXght to have a career. I oXght to go to gradXate school and learn
some Nind oI occXpation, bXt I. can’t get enthXsiastic aboXt anything. I’ve
thoXght oI everything—teaching  , scholarly  worN, international  relations,
medicine, agricXltXre,  ecology—bXt    nothing  tXrns me  on.  I   may  get
interested in  it  Ior   a  day or  two,   bXt then  every  Iield  seems to  have
insXrmoXntable problems. LiIe seems to be an insXrmoXntable problem.”
         His  problem  began, Ted said,  when he  was eighteen and  entered
college. Until   then everything  had  been Iine.  He  had  had basically  an
ordinary childhood  in  a stable well-to-do  home  with  two older  brothers;
parents who cared Ior him  even iI  they  didn’t  care mXch Ior  each other;
good grades and  satisIactions in  a  private  boarding school.  Then—and
perhaps this was crXcial—came a passionate love aIIair with a woman who

168
reMected him the weeN beIore he entered college. DeMected, he had spent
most oI his Ireshman year drXnN. Still, he maintained good grades. Then he
had several other love aIIairs, each one more halIhearted and XnsXccessIXl
than the last. His grades began to slip. He coXld not  decide what to write
papers aboXt. A close Iriend, HanN, was Nilled in an aXtomobile accident in
the middle  oI  his MXnior year, bXt he’d gotten  over it.  He  even stopped
drinNing that  year. BXt  the  problem  with  decision-maNing became still
worse. He simply  coXld not  choose a topic on  which  to write  his  senior
thesis. He Iinished his coXrse worN. He rented an oII-campXs room. All he
needed to gradXate was to sXbmit a short thesis, the Nind oI thing one coXld
do in a month. It tooN him the Iollowing  three years. Then, nothing. Seven
years beIore, he had come here to the woods.
         Ted Ielt certain that his problem was rooted in his se[Xality. AIter all,
his diIIicXlties  had begXn, had they not, with an  XnsXccessIXl love aIIair?
Besides, he had read almost everything that  FreXd had ever written  (and
mXch more than  I  myselI  had read).  So dXring  the Iirst   si[  months  oI
therapy we plXmbed the depths oI his childhood se[Xality, getting nowhere
in particXlar. BXt in that period several interesting Iacets oI his personality
did emerge. One was his total lacN oI enthXsiasm. He might wish Ior good
weather, bXt when it came he woXld shrXg his shoXlders and say, “It doesn’t
really maNe any diIIerence. Basically one day’s MXst liNe the ne[t.” Fishing
in the laNe, he caXght an enormoXs piNe, “BXt it was more than I coXld eat
and I have no Iriends to share it with, so I threw it bacN.”
         Related to this lacN oI enthXsiasm was a Nind oI global snobbishness,
as iI he IoXnd the world and all that was in it to be in poor taste. His was the
critics’s eye. I  came to  sXspect he employed this snobbishness to Neep a
Nind oI distance between himselI and things that might otherwise aIIect him
emotionally. Finally,  Ted  had an  enormoXs penchant Ior secrecy, which
made therapy very  slow going  indeed. The  most important  Iacts oI  any
incident had to be pried oXt oI him. He had a dream: “I was in a classroom.
There was an obMect—I don’t Nnow what—which I had placed inside a bo[.
I had bXilt  the bo[  aroXnd the obMect so that no one coXld tell what  was
inside it. I had placed the bo[  inside a dead tree, and with Iinely Iashioned
wooden screws had  replaced the  barN over  the bo[.   BXt  sitting  in  the
classroom I sXddenly remembered that I had not been certain to maNe the
screws IlXsh with the barN. I became TXite an[ioXs. So I rXshed oXt to the

169
woods and worNed the screws so that no one coXld distingXish them Irom
the barN. Then I Ielt better and came bacN to class.” As with many people,
class and classroom were symbols Ior therapy in Ted’s dreams. It was clear
he did not want me to Iind the core oI his neXrosis.
         The Iirst  small chinN in Ted’s armor  occXrred dXring one session in
the si[th month oI  therapy. He had spent the evening beIore at the hoXse oI
an acTXaintance. “It was a dreadIXl evening,” Ted lamented. “He wanted me
to listen to this new record he’d boXght, Neil Diamond’s soXnd tracN Ior the
movie  oI  Jonathan  LiYingston  Seagull.  It   was e[crXciating.   I   do  not
Xnderstand how edXcated people can actXally enMoy sXch pXtrid mXcilage or
even call it mXsic.”
         The intensity oI his  snobbish reaction caXsed me to picN Xp my ears.
“Jonathan LiYingston Seagull was a religioXs  booN,” I  commented. “:as
the mXsic also religioXs?”
         “I  sXppose yoX coXld call it  religioXs as mXch as yoX coXld  call it
mXsic.”
         “Perhaps it was the religion that oIIended yoX,” I sXggested, “and not
so mXch the mXsic.”
         “:ell,    I certainly do Iind that Nind oI religion oIIensive, Ted replied.
         “:hat    Nind oI religion is that Nind?”
         “Sentimental. MawNish.” Ted almost spat the words oXt.
         “:hat    other Nind oI religion is there?” I asNed.
         Ted looNed pXzzled, disconcerted.  “Not  mXch,  I  gXess. I  gXess I
generally Iind religion Xnappealing.”
         “Has it always been that way?”
         He laXghed rXeIXlly. “No,  when I  was a IXzzy-brained adolescent I
was TXite into religion.  My  senior year  oI boarding  school I  was even a
deacon oI the little chXrch we had.”
         “Then what?”
         “Then what what?”
         “:ell,    what happened to yoXr religion?” I asNed.
         “I  MXst grew oXt oI it, I gXess.”
         “How  did yoX grow oXt oI it?”
         “:hat    do  yoX mean, how  did  I  grow  oXt oI  it?”  Ted  was clearly
becoming irritated now. “How   does one grow oXt oI anything? I  MXst did,
that’s all.”

170
         “:hen   did  yoX grow oXt oI it?
         “I  don’t Nnow. It MXst happened. I told yoX. I never went to chXrch in
college.”
         “Never?”
         “Never once.”
         “So yoXr senior year oI high school yoX’re a deacon in the chXrch,” I
commented. “Then that sXmmer yoX have an XnsXccessIXl love aIIair. And
then yoX never go  to  chXrch again. It  was an abrXpt change. YoX don’t
sXppose yoXr girlIriend’s reMection had anything to do with it, do yoX?”
         “I  don’t  sXppose anything. The same pattern was trXe oI lots oI my
classmates. :e    were  coming  oI  age  in   a  time  when  religion   wasn’t
Iashionable anyway. Maybe  my  girlIriend  had  something to  do  with  it,
maybe she didn’t.   How  shoXld  I  Nnow? All   I   Nnow is  I  MXst became
Xninterested in religion.”
         The ne[t  breaN came a month later. :e   had been IocXsing on Ted’s
notable lacN oI enthXsiasm aboXt anything, which he readily acNnowledged.
“The last time I  can distinctly remember being enthXsiastic,” he said, “was
ten years ago, in my MXnior year. It was over a paper I was writing at the end
oI a Iall semester coXrse in modem British poetry.”
         “:hat    was the paper aboXt?” I asNed.
         “I  really don’t thinN I can remember, it was so long ago.”
         “PoppycocN,” I said. “YoX can remember iI yoX want to.”
         “:ell,    I thinN it  had to do with Gerard Manley HopNins. He was one
oI the Iirst oI the trXly modem poets. ‘Pied BeaXty’ was probably the poem
it centered on.”
         I  leIt  the oIIice,  went  to  my  library,  and came bacN with  a  dXsty
volXme oI British  poetry Irom  my college years. “Pied  BeaXty” was there
on page 819. I read:

         Glory be to God for dappled things—
                For  skies of couple-colour as a brindled coZ;
                For  rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that sZim;
             Fresh-firecoal chestnut falls; finches’ Zings;
                Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, falloZ, and plough;
                And all  trades, their gear and tackle and trim.
                All  things counter, original, spare, strange;

171
                WhateYer is fickle, freckled (Zho knoZs hoZ?)
                With sZift,  sloZ; sZeet, sour; adazzle, dim;
             He fathers-forth Zhose beauty is past change;
                Praise him.

         Tears came to my eyes. “It is, itselI, a poem aboXt enthXsiasm,” I said.
         “Yes. “
         “It’s  also a very religioXs poem.”
         “Yes.”
         “YoX wrote the paper on it at the end oI the Iall semester. That woXld
have been JanXary?”
         “Yes. “
         “II  I calcXlate correctly, it was in the ne[t  month, FebrXary, that yoXr
Iriend HanN died.”
         “Yes.”
         I coXld Ieel  an incredible tension growing.  I was not  sXre what was
the right thing to  do. Hoping, I  ploXghed ahead. “So yoX were reMected by
yoXr Iirst real girl Iriend  at seventeen and yoX gave Xp yoXr enthXsiasm Ior
the chXrch. Three years later yoXr best Iriend died and yoX gave Xp yoXr
enthXsiasm Ior everything.”
         “I  didn’t  give it Xp, it  was taNen Irom me.” Ted was almost shoXting
now, more emotional than I had ever seen him.
         “God reMected yoX so yoX reMected God.”
         “:ell,     why  shoXldn’t  I?”  he  demanded. “It’s   a  shitty  world.  It’s
always been a shitty world.”
         “I  thoXght yoXr childhood was TXite happy.”
         “No, that was shitty too.”
         And  so it  was. Underneath its calm  e[terior  Ted’s childhood  home
had been a continXal bloody battlegroXnd Ior him. His  two  older brothers
had picNed on him with Xnparalleled vicioXsness. His parents, too involved
in their  own aIIairs  and their  hatred oI each other to  concern themselves
with  the  seemingly  minor  problems  oI  children,  had  oIIered  him,  the
smallest and the weaNest, no protection. Escape to the coXntryside Ior long,
solitary walNs was his greatest solace, and we were able to establish that his
hermitliNe pattern  had  its  roots  in  the  years beIore  he  was  even ten.
Boarding school, with its minor crXelties, had been a relieI. As he talNed oI

172
these things, Ted’s resentment oI the world—or rather his ventilation oI that
resentment—gathered momentXm. In the months that Iollowed he relived
not only the pain oI his childhood and the pain oI HanN’s death bXt also the
pain oI  a  thoXsand smaller deaths and reMections and losses. All oI  liIe
seemed a maelstrom oI death and sXIIering, danger and savagery.
         AIter  IiIteen   months oI   therapy there  came a  tXrning  point.  Ted
broXght into his  session a little  booN. “YoX’re  always talNing aboXt how
secretive I am—and, oI coXrse, I am,” he said. “Last night I was rXmmaging
throXgh some old  stXII  and I  IoXnd  this  MoXrnal that I Nept dXring my
sophomore year at college. I haven’t even looNed at it to censor it. I thoXght
perhaps yoX might liNe to read the Xne[pXrgated me oI a decade ago.”
         I  said I  woXld, and  I did  Ior  the  ne[t  two  nights. ActXally,  it  was
hardly revelatory e[cept to conIirm  that his pattern as a loner, isolated by a
snobbishness born oI hXrt, was deeply entrenched even then. BXt one little
vignette caXght my eye. He described how he had gone hiNing alone on a
SXnday in JanXary and had been caXght in  a heavy snowstorm  and had
gotten bacN to his dormitory several hoXrs aIter darN. “I Ielt a certain sense
oI e[hilaration,”  he had written, “Xpon my retXrn to the saIety oI my room,
not XnliNe that which I  e[perienced last  sXmmer when I came so near to
death.” The ne[t day in oXr session I asNed him to tell me how he had come
near to death.
         “Oh, I’ve  told yoX aboXt that,” Ted said.
         By  this  time  I  Nnew  well  that  whenever Ted  proclaimed  he had
already told me something, he was trying to hide it.
         “YoX’re being secretive again,” I responded.
         “:ell,    I’m  sXre I told yoX. I mXst have. Anyway, there wasn’t all that
mXch to it.  YoX remember I worNed in  Florida that  sXmmer between my
Ireshman and sophomore  years. There  was a  hXrricane. I  Nind  oI  liNe
storms, yoX Nnow. At the height oI the storm I went oXt on a pier. A wave
washed me oII. Then another washed me bacN on. That was all there was to
it. It was over very TXicNly.”
         “YoX went  oXt to the end oI  a pier  at the height  oI a  hXrricane?” I
asNed incredXloXsly.
         “I  told yoX. I liNe storms. I wanted to be close to that elemental IXry.”
         “I  can  Xnderstand that,” I  said. “:e    both  liNe storms. BXt  I  don’t
Nnow that I woXld have pXt myselI in Meopardy liNe that. “

173
         “:ell,     yoX  Nnow  I  have  a  sXicidal  streaN,”  Ted replied   almost
impishly. “And  I  was certainly Ieeling sXicidal that sXmmer. I’ve analyzed
it.  FranNly, I  can’t remember going  oXt on  the  pier with   any conscioXs
sXicidal  intent.   BXt  I   certainly   didn’t    care  mXch  aboXt  liIe   and   I
acNnowledge the possibility that I was being sXicidal.”
         “YoX were washed oII?”
         “Yes. I  hardly Nnew what was happening. There was so mXch spray
yoX really coXldn’t see mXch oI anything.  I gXess a particXlarly big wave
came. I Ielt it  slam into me, Ielt  myselI swept away, Ielt myselI lost  in the
water. There was nothing I  coXld do  to save myselI. I  was certain  I was
going to  die.  I  Ielt  terriIied.   AIter  aboXt a  minXte I  Ielt   myselI  tossed
bacNward by the water—it mXst have been some Nind oI bacNwash wave—
and a second later I was slammed down against the concrete oI the pier. I
crawled to the side oI  the pier, gripped it  , and hand over  hand I crawled
bacN to the land. I was a bit brXised. That was all.”
         “How  do yoX Ieel aboXt the e[perience?”
         “:hat     do yoX  mean, how  do  I  Ieel  aboXt it?”   Ted asNed in  his
resisting way.
         “JXst what I asNed. How do yoX Ieel aboXt it?”
         “YoX mean aboXt being saved?” he TXeried.
         “Yes. “
         “:ell,    I gXess I Ieel I was IortXnate.”
         “FortXnate?” I TXeried. “JXst an XnXsXal coincidence, that bacNwash
wave?”
         “Yes, that’s all.”
         “Some might call it miracXloXs,” I commented.
         “I  gXess I was lXcNy.”
         “YoX gXess yoX were lXcNy,” I repeated, goading him.
         “Yes, goddammit, I gXess I was lXcNy.”
         “It’s  interesting, Ted,” I said, “that  whenever something signiIicantly
painIXl happens to yoX, yoX rail against God, yoX rail against what a shitty,
terrible world  it  is. BXt when  something good happens to yoX, yoX gXess
yoX’re lXcNy. A minor tragedy and it’s  God’s IaXlt. A  miracXloXs blessing
and it’s a bit lXcNy. :hat do yoX maNe oI that?”
         ConIronted with  the  inconsistency oI  his attitXde toward  good and
bad IortXne, Ted began to IocXs more and more on things that were right

174
with the world,  on the sweet as well as the soXr, the dazzle as well as the
dim. Having worNed throXgh the pain oI HanN’s death and the other deaths
he had e[perienced, he began to e[amine the other side oI the coin oI liIe.
He came to accept the necessity oI sXIIering and to embrace the parado[ical
natXre oI  e[istence, the  “dappled  things.”  This  acceptance occXrred, oI
coXrse, in  the  conte[t  oI  a  warm,  loving   and  increasingly  pleasXrable
relationship between Xs. He began to move oXt. Very tentatively, he started
dating again. He  began to e[press  Iaint  enthXsiasm. His religioXs natXre
blossomed. Everywhere he looNed he saw the mystery oI liIe and death, oI
creation and decay and regeneration. He read theology. He listened to Jesus
Christ, Superstar, to Godspell, and even boXght his own copy oI Jonathan
LiYingston Seagull. AIter two years oI therapy Ted annoXnced one morning
that the time had come Ior him to get on with  it. “I’ve  been thinNing aboXt
applying to a gradXate school in psychology,” he said. “I Nnow yoX’re going
to say that I’m  MXst imitating yoX, bXt I’ve looNed at that and I don’t thinN
that’s it.”
         “Go on,” I  reTXested.
         “:ell,    in thinNing aboXt this it seemed to me I oXght to try to do what
is most important. II  I  am going  bacN to school I want  to stXdy the most
important things.”
         “Go on.”
         “So I decided that the hXman mind is important. And doing therapy is
important.”
         “The  hXman  mind  and  psychotherapy, that’s  the  most  important
thing?” I TXeried.
         “:ell,    I sXppose God is the most important thing.”
         “So why don’t yoX stXdy God?” I asNed.
         “:hat    do yoX mean?”
         “II  God is the most important thing, why don’t yoX stXdy God?”
         “I’m  sorry. I simply don’t Xnderstand yoX,” Ted said.
         “That’s  becaXse yoX’re  blocNing yoXrselI  Irom   Xnderstanding,” I
replied.
         “Really, I don’t Xnderstand. How can one stXdy God?”
         “One stXdies psychology in a school. One stXdies God in a school,” I
answered.
         “YoX mean theology school?”

175
         “Yes.”
         “YoX mean, become a minister?”
         “Yes.”
         “Oh, no, I coXldn’t do that.” Ted was aghast.
         “:hy    not?”
         Ted became shiIty. “There isn’t necessarily any diIIerence between a
psychotherapist and a minister. I mean, ministers do  lots oI  therapy. And
doing psychotherapy, well, it’s liNe a ministry. “
         “So why coXldn’t yoX become a minister?”
         “YoX’re  pressXring  me,”  Ted  IXmed.  “A   career  is  my   personal
decision. It’s  Xp  to  me to  go  into  the  career I   want. Therapists  aren’t
sXpposed to direct patients. It’s not yoXr role to maNe choices Ior me. I’ll
maNe my own choices.”
         “LooN,”  I  said, “I  am not  maNing any choice Ior  yoX. I  am in  this
instance being pXrely analytical.  I  am analyzing  the alternatives open to
yoX. YoX are the one who Ior some reason does not want to looN at one oI
those alternatives. YoX are the one who  wants to  do the  most important
thing. YoX are the one who Ieels that God is the most important thing. Yet
when I drag yoX to  Iinally  looN at the alternative oI  a career in God, yoX
e[clXde it. YoX say yoX coXldn’t do it. Fine iI  yoX can’t do it.  BXt it is  my
province to be interested in why yoX Ieel yoX can’t do it, why yoX e[clXde it
as an alternative.”
         “I  MXst coXldn’t be a minister,” Ted said lamely.
         “:hy    not?”
         “BecaXse... becaXse to be a minister one is pXblicly a man oI God. I
mean, I’d have to go pXblic with my  belieI in God:  I’d have to be pXblicly
enthXsiastic aboXt it. I MXst coXldn’t do that.”
         “No, yoX’ve got to be secret, don’t yoX?” I said. “That’s yoXr neXrosis
and yoX’ve got to Neep it. YoX can’t be pXblicly enthXsiastic. YoX’ve got to
Neep yoXr enthXsiasm in the closet, don’t yoX?”
         “LooN,” Ted wailed, “yoX don’t Nnow what it’s liNe Ior me. YoX don’t
Nnow what  it’s  liNe  to  be  me. Every   time  I  opened my  moXth  to  be
enthXsiastic aboXt something my brothers woXld tease me Ior it. “
         “So I gXess yoX’re still ten years old,” I remarNed, “and yoXr brothers
are still aroXnd.”
         Ted was actXally crying now with IrXstration at me.

176
         “That’s not  all,”  he said, weeping. “That’s how my  parents pXnished
me. :henever   I  did something wrong  they tooN what I  loved away Irom
me. ‘Let’s  see, what is it  that Ted’s most enthXsiastic aboXt? Oh, yes, the
trip to his aXnt’s ne[t weeN. He’s really e[cited aboXt that. So we’ll tell him
that becaXse he’s been bad he can’t go see his aXnt. That’s it. Then there’s
his bow and arrows. He really loves his bow and arrows. So we’ll taNe that
away.’ Simple.  Simple system. Everything  I  was enthXsiastic aboXt they
tooN away. Everything I loved I lost.”
         And so we arrived at the deepest core oI Ted’s neXrosis. GradXally, by
act oI will,   continXally having to remind  himselI that he was not  still  ten,
that he  was not  still  Xnder  the thXmb oI   his parents or  within   striNing
distance oI his brothers, bit  by  bit  he Iorced himselI  to commXnicate his
enthXsiasm, his love oI liIe and his love oI God. He did  decide to go on to
divinity  school A Iew weeNs beIore he leIt I received a checN Irom him Ior
the previoXs month’s  sessions. Something aboXt it  caXght my  eye.  His
signatXre seemed longer. I looNed at it closely. PrevioXsly he had always
signed his name “Ted.” Now it was “Theodore.” I called his attention to the
change.
         “I  was hoping yoX woXld  notice it,”  he said. “I  gXess in a way I’m
still Neeping secrets, aren’t I? :hen I  was very yoXng my aXnt told me that
I shoXld be proXd oI the name Theodore becaXse it means ‘lover oI God.’ I
was proXd. So I told my brothers aboXt it. Christ, did they maNe IXn oI me.
They called me a sissy in ten diIIerent  ways. ‘Sissy choir  boy. :hy    don’t
yoX go Niss the altar? :hy don’t yoX go Niss the choirmaster?’“ Ted smiled.
“YoX Nnow the whole  roXtine. So I became embarrassed by the name. A
Iew weeNs ago it occXrred to me  that I  was no longer embarrassed. So I
decided it was all right to  Xse my IXll name now. AIter all, I  am a lover oI
God, aren’t I?”

         The  Baby    and  the   BathZater


         The Ioregoing case histories were oIIered in response to a TXestion: Is
belieI in God a Iorm  oI psychopathology? II we  are to rise oXt oI the mire
oI childhood teaching, local  tradition and sXperstition, it is  a TXestion that
mXst be asNed. BXt these case histories indicate that the answer is not  a

177
simple one. The answer sometimes is yes. Kathy’s XnTXestioning belieI in
the God  her chXrch and  mother taXght clearly  retarded her  growth  and
poisoned her spirit. Only by  TXestioning and discarding her belieI was she
able to ventXre Iorth  into  a wider,  more satisIying,  more prodXctive liIe.
Only then was she Iree to grow. BXt  the answer also is sometimes no. As
Marcia grew  oXt oI  the  cold  microcosm oI  her  childhood  into  a larger,
warmer world, a belieI  in God also grew within  her, TXietly and natXrally.
And Ted’s IorsaNen belieI in God had to be resXrrected as an essential part
oI the liberation and resXrrection oI his spirit.
         :hat    are  we  to  do   with  this  yes-and-no  answer? Scientists  are
dedicated to  asNing TXestions in the  search Ior  trXth. BXt  they  too  are
hXman, and liNe all hXmans, they woXld liNe their answers to be clean and
dear and easy. In their desire Ior simple solXtions, scientists are prone to Iall
into two traps as they TXestion the reality oI God. The Iirst is  to throw the
baby oXt with the bath water. And the second is tXnnel vision.
         There is clearly  a lot  oI  dirty  bath water sXrroXnding the reality  oI
God.   Holy    wars.   InTXisitions.   Animal    sacriIice.   HXman   sacriIice.
SXperstition.  StXltiIication.    Dogmatism.   Ignorance.   Hypocrisy.   SelI-
righteoXsness. Rigidity. CrXelty. BooN-bXrning. :itch-bXrning.   Inhibition.
Fear. ConIormity. Morbid  gXilt. Insanity. The list  is almost endless. BXt is
all this what God has done to hXmans or what hXmans have done to God? It
is abXndantly evident that belieI in God is oIten  destrXctively dogmatic. Is
the problem, then, that hXmans tend to believe in  God, or  is the problem
that hXmans tend to be dogmatic? Anyone who  has Nnown a died-in-the-
wool atheist will   Nnow that sXch an individXal can be  as dogmatic aboXt
XnbelieI as any believer can be aboXt belieI. Is it belieI in God we need to
get rid oI, or is it dogmatism?
         Another reason that scientists are so prone to throw the baby oXt with
the bath water is that science itselI, as I have sXggested, is a religion. The
neophyte scientist, recently come or converted to the world view oI science,
can be every bit as Ianatical as a Christian crXsader or a soldier oI  Allah.
This is particXlarly the case when we have come to science Irom a cXltXre
and home  in  which  belieI  in  God  is  Iirmly   associated with  ignorance,
sXperstition, rigidity  and hypocrisy.  Then we  have emotional  as well  as
intellectXal motives  to   smash the  idols  oI  primitive   Iaith.   A  marN  oI

178
matXrity in  scientists, however, is their awareness that science may be as
sXbMect to dogmatism as any other religion.
         I have Iirmly  stated that it is essential to oXr spiritXal growth Ior Xs to
become scientists who are sNeptical oI what we have been taXght—that is,
the common notions  and assXmptions oI oXr cXltXre. BXt the  notions oI
science themselves oIten become cXltXral idols, and it is necessary that we
become sNeptical oI these as well. It is indeed possible Ior Xs to matXre oXt
oI a  belieI  in  God. :hat    I  woXld  now  liNe to  sXggest is that it  is  also
possible to matXre into a belieI in God. A sNeptical atheism or agnosticism
is not necessarily the highest state oI Xnderstanding at which hXman beings
can arrive. To the contrary, there is reason to believe that behind spXrioXs
notions and Ialse concepts oI God there lies  a reality that  is God. This  is
what PaXl Tillich  meant when  he reIerred to  the “god  beyond God”  and
why some sophisticated Christians Xsed to proclaim MoyIXlly, “God is dead.
Long live God.” Is it  possible that the path oI spiritXal growth leads Iirst oXt
oI  sXperstition into  agnosticism and  then oXt oI   agnosticism toward  an
accXrate Nnowledge oI God? It was oI this path that the SXIi Aba Said ibn
Abi-I-Khair  was speaNing more than nine hXndred years ago when he said:

                Until  college and minaret haYe crumbled
                This holy Zork  of ours Zill  not be done.
                Until  faith becomes rejection, and rejection becomes belief
                There Zill  be no true Muslim. *
         * Quoted from  Idries Shah, The Way of the Sufi (New York:  Dutton
paperback, 1970), p. 44.

         :hether   or  not the path oI spiritXal growth  necessarily leads Irom a
sNeptical atheism or agnosticism toward an accXrate belieI in God, the Iact
oI the matter is that some intellectXally sophisticated and sNeptical people,
sXch as Marcia and Ted, do seem to grow in the direction oI belieI. And it
shoXld be noted that this belieI into which they grew was not at all liNe that
oXt oI which  Kathy  evolved. The God that  comes beIore sNepticism may
bear little resemblance to the God that comes aIter. As I  mentioned at the
beginning oI this section, there is no single, monolithic  religion.  There are
many religions, and perhaps many levels to belieI. Some religions may be
Xnhealthy Ior some people; others may be healthy.

179
         All    this  is   oI   particXlar   import   Ior   those  scientists   who   are
psychiatrists or   psychotherapists. Dealing  so  directly   with  the  growth
process, they more than anyone else are called Xpon to maNe MXdgments as
to the healthiness oI an individXal’s belieI system. BecaXse psychotherapists
generally belong to a sNeptical iI not  strictly  FreXdian tradition, there is a
tendency Ior   them   to  consider  any   passionate belieI   in   God  to   be
pathological. Upon occasion this tendency may go over the line into  IranN
bias and preMXdice. Not long ago I met a  college senior who  was giving
serioXs consideration to the possibility oI entering a monastery a Iew years
hence. He  had been in   psychotherapy Ior  the  preceding year  and was
continXing. “BXt   I  have  not  been  able to  tell   my  therapist  aboXt the
monastery or the depth oI my religioXs belieI,”  he conIided. “I  don’t thinN
he woXld Xnderstand.” I did not begin to Nnow this yoXng man well enoXgh
to assess the meaning that the monastery held Ior him or whether his desire
to Moin it was neXrotically determined. I very mXch woXld have liNed to say
to him:  “YoX really oXght to  tell yoXr therapist aboXt it.  It is  essential Ior
yoXr therapy  that yoX  be  open aboXt everything,  particXlarly  a  serioXs
matter sXch as this. YoX shoXld trXst yoXr therapist to be obMective.” BXt I
did not. For I  was not at all sXre that his therapist woXld be obMective, that
he woXld Xnderstand, in the trXe meaning oI the word.
         Psychiatrists  and  psychotherapists who   have  simplistic   attitXdes
toward religion are liNely to  do a disservice to some oI their patients. This
will  be trXe iI they regard all religion as good or healthy. It will also be trXe
iI  they throw  oXt the baby with  the bath water  and regard all  religion as
sicNness or the Enemy. And, Iinally,   it  will  be trXe  iI  in  the Iace oI  the
comple[ity  oI the matter they withdraw themselves Irom dealing at all with
the religioXs issXes oI their  patients, hiding  behind a cloaN oI  sXch total
obMectivity that they do not consider it to be their role to be, themselves, in
any way  spiritXally or  religioXsly  involved.  For their  patients oIten need
their involvement.  I  do not  mean to imply  that  they shoXld IorsaNe their
obMectivity, or that balancing their obMectivity with their own spiritXality is
an  easy matter.  It   is   not.  To   the  contrary,  my   plea  woXld  be  that
psychotherapists oI all  Ninds shoXld pXsh themselves to become not less
involved  bXt  rather  more  sophisticated in   religioXs  matters  than  they
IreTXently are.

180
         Scientific     Tunnel    Vision


         Occasionally   psychiatrists   encoXnter   patients   with    a   strange
distXrbance oI vision; these patients are able to see only a very narrow area
directly in Iront oI  them. They cannot see anything to the leIt or to the right,
above or below their narrow IocXs. They cannot see two obMects adMacent to
each other at the same time, they can see only one thing at a time and mXst
tXrn their  heads iI  they are  to  see another. They liNen this  symptom  to
looNing down a tXnnel being  able to see only  a small  circle oI  light  and
clarity  at the end. No  physical  distXrbance in their  visXal system can be
IoXnd to accoXnt Ior the symptom. It  is as iI  Ior some reason they do not
want to  see more than immediately  meets the eye, more than  what they
choose to IocXs their attention Xpon.
         Another maMor reason that scientists are prone to throw the baby oXt
with the bath water is that they do not see the baby. Many scientists simply
do not looN at the evidence oI the reality oI God. They sXIIer Irom a Nind oI
tXnnel vision, a psychologically selI-imposed psychological set oI blinders
which prevents them Irom tXrning their attention to the realm oI the spirit.
         Among  the caXses oI  this scientiIic   tXnnel vision  I  woXld  liNe to
discXss two that resXlt Irom the natXre oI  scientiIic tradition.  The Iirst  oI
these is an issXe oI methodology. In its laXdable insistence Xpon e[perience,
accXrate observation and veriIiability,  science has placed great emphasis
Xpon measXrement. To measXre something is to e[perience it in a certain
dimension, a  dimension  in  which   we  can  maNe observations oI  great
accXracy which  are repeatable by  others. The  Xse oI  measXrement has
enabled science to  maNe enormoXs strides in  the  Xnderstanding oI  the
material Xniverse. BXt by virtXe oI its sXccess, measXrement has become a
Nind oI scientiIic idol. The resXlt is an attitXde on the part oI many scientists
oI not only sNepticism bXt oXtright reMection oI what cannot be measXred. It
is as iI they were to say, “:hat   we cannot measXre, we cannot Nnow; there
is no point in worrying  aboXt what we cannot Nnow; thereIore, what cannot
be measXred is Xnimportant and Xnworthy oI oXr observation.” BecaXse oI
this attitXde many  scientists e[clXde  Irom  their serioXs consideration all
matters that  are—or  seem to  be—intangible.  InclXding,  oI   coXrse, the
matter oI God.

181
         This strange bXt remarNably common assXmption that things that are
not easy to  stXdy do  not  merit  stXdy is  beginning  to be  challenged by
several relatively  recent  developments within  science itselI.  One  is  the
development oI increasingly sophisticated methods oI  stXdy. ThroXgh the
Xse oI  hardware sXch as  electron microscopes, spectrophotometers and
compXters, and soItware sXch as statistical techniTXes we are now able to
maNe measXrements oI increasingly  comple[   phenomena which  a  Iew
decades ago  were   XnmeasXrable. The  range   oI   scientiIic   vision   is
conseTXently e[panding. As it continXes to e[pand, perhaps we shall soon
be able to  say: “There  is nothing  beyond the limits   oI oXr  vision. II   we
decide to stXdy something, we can always Iind the methodology with which
to do it.”
         The other development that is  assisting Xs to escape Irom scientiIic
tXnnel vision is the relatively  recent discovery by science oI the reality  oI
parado[. A  hXndred years ago parado[ meant error to the scientiIic  mind.
BXt e[ploring   sXch phenomena as the natXre oI light,  electromagnetism,
TXantXm mechanics and relativity theory, physical science has matXred over
the past centXry to the point  where it  is increasingly recognized that at  a
certain level reality is parado[ical. ThXs J. Robert Oppenheimer wrote:

                To  what appear to  be the simplest  TXestions, we. will  tend to
       give  either  no  answer  or  an  answer  which  will   at  Iirst   sight  be
       reminiscent more  oI a  strange catechism than oI the  straightIorward
       aIIirmatives  oI  physical science. II we  asN, Ior instance, whether the
       position oI  the electron remains the same, we mXst say “no”; iI we asN
       whether the electron’s position changes with time, we  mXst say “no”;
       iI  we asN whether the electron is at rest, we mXst say “no”; iI  we asN
       whether it is in  motion, we mXst say “no.” The BXddha has given sXch
       answers when interrogated as to the conditions oI a man’s selI aIter his
       death;  bXt  they  are not   the Iamiliar   answers  Ior  the  tradition   oI
       seventeenth and eighteenth centXry science. *

Schuster,1953), p. 40.

         Mystics have spoNen to Xs throXgh the ages in terms oI parado[. Is it
possible that we are beginning to see a meeting groXnd between science and

182
religion? :hen   we are able to say that “a hXman is both mortal and eternal
at the same time” and “light is both a wave and a particle at the same time,”
we have begXn to speaN the same langXage. Is it possible that the path oI
spiritXal  growth  that  proceeds Irom   religioXs  sXperstition  to  scientiIic
sNepticism may indeed Xltimately lead Xs to a genXine, religioXs reality?
         This beginning possibility oI  XniIication oI religion  and science is the
most signiIicant and e[citing  happening in oXr intellectXal liIe today. BXt it
is only MXst beginning. For the most part both the religioXs and the scientiIic
remain in   selI-imposed  narrow  Irames  oI  reIerence,  each still   largely
blinded by its  own particXlar type oI tXnnel vision.  E[amine, Ior  instance,
the behavior oI both in regard to the TXestion oI miracles. Even the idea oI a
miracle is anathema to most scientists. Over the past IoXr hXndred years or
so science has elXcidated a nXmber oI “natXral laws,” sXch as “Two obMects
attract each other in proportion to  their mass and in inverse proportion  to
the  distance  between them”   or   “Energy   can  neither  be  created  nor
destroyed.”  BXt  having   been  sXccessIXl in  discovering   natXral  laws,
scientists in  their  world  view  have made an  idol  oXt oI  the  concept oI
natXral law, MXst as they made an idol oXt oI the notion oI measXrement. The
resXlt is that any  event that cannot be e[plained  by  cXrrently Xnderstood
natXral law  is  assXmed to be Xnreal  by  the scientiIic  establishment. In
regard to methodology, science has tended to say, “:hat is very diIIicXlt to
stXdy doesn’t merit stXdy.” And  in regard to  natXral law, science tends to
say, “:hat   is very diIIicXlt to Xnderstand doesn’t e[ist. “
         The  chXrch has been  a  bit  more  broad-minded. To  the  religioXs
establishment what cannot be Xnderstood in terms oI Nnown natXral law is a
miracle, and miracles do e[ist.   BXt beyond aXthenticating their e[istence,
the chXrch has not been an[ioXs to looN at miracles very closely. “Miracles
need not  be  scientiIically  e[amined”   has  been the  prevailing  religioXs
attitXde. “They shoXld simply  be accepted as acts oI God.”  The religioXs
have not wanted their religion shaNen by science, MXst as the scientiIic have
not wanted their  science to be  shaNen by religion. Events oI  miracXloXs
healing, Ior instance, have been Xsed by the Catholic ChXrch to aXthenticate
its  saints,   and  they   are   almost  standard  Iare   Ior   many   Protestant
denominations. Yet the chXrches have never said to physicians, “:oXld yoX
Moin with  Xs to   stXdy these  most  Iascinating  phenomena?” Nor   have
physicians said, “May  we get together with  yoX to  e[amine  scientiIically

183
these occXrrences which shoXld be  oI  sXch interest to  oXr proIession?”
Instead the attitXde oI the medical proIession has been that miracle  cXres
are none[istent, that the disease oI which a person was cXred did not e[ist
in the  Iirst  place, either becaXse it was an imaginary  disorder, sXch as a
hysterical  conversion reaction,  or  else  becaXse it  was  a  misdiagnosis.
FortXnately, however, a  Iew  serioXs scientists, physicians  and religioXs
trXth-seeNers are cXrrently in the process oI beginning to e[amine the natXre
oI  sXch phenomena as  spontaneoXs remissions in  cancer  patients and
apparently sXccessIXl e[amples oI psychic healing.
         FiIteen  years ago, when  I  gradXated Irom  medical  school,  I  was
certain that  there  were  no  miracles. Today  I  am  certain  that  miracles
aboXnd. This change in my conscioXsness has been the resXlt oI two Iactors
worNing hand in hand. One Iactor is a whole variety oI e[periences I  have
had as a psychiatrist which initially seemed TXite commonplace bXt which,
when I thoXght aboXt them more deeply, seemed to indicate that my worN
with patients toward their growth was being remarNably assisted in ways Ior
which I  had  no logical  e[planation—that  is,  ways that were  miracXloXs.
These e[periences, some oI which I shall be recoXnting, led me to TXestion
my  previoXs assXmption that  miracXloXs occXrrences were  impossible.
Once I TXestioned this assXmption I became open to the possible e[istence
oI the miracXloXs. This openness, which was the second Iactor caXsing my
change in conscioXsness, then allowed me to  begin  roXtinely looNing  at
ordinary e[istence with  an eye Ior the miracXloXs. The more I looNed, the
more I IoXnd. II there were bXt one thing I coXld hope Ior Irom the reader oI
the remainder oI this booN, it woXld be that he or she possesses the capacity
to perceive the miracXloXs. OI this capacity it has recently been written:

                SelI-realization   is  born  and matXres in  a  distinctive  Nind  oI
       awareness, an awareness that has been described in  many diIIerent
       ways by many diIIerent people. The mystics, Ior e[ample, have spoNen
       oI  it  as  the perception oI  the  divinity   and perIection oI  the  world.
       Richard BXcNe reIerred to it as cosmic conscioXsness; BXber described
       it  in  terms oI  the I-ThoX  relationship; and Maslow  gave it  the label
       “Being   cognition”.  :e    shall  Xse OXspensNy’s term and call  it   the
       perception  oI  the miracXloXs. “MiracXloXs”  here reIers  not only  to
       e[traordinary  phenomena bXt also to the commonplace, Ior. absolXtely

184
       anything can evoNe this special awareness provided that close enoXgh
       attention  is   paid  to   it.  Once  perception  is   disengaged Irom   the
       domination   oI  preconception  and  personal  interest,  it   is  Iree   to
       e[perience  the  world   as it   is  in  itselI   and to  behold  its  inherent
       magniIicence…  Perception  oI  the  miracXloXs reTXires no  Iaith  or
       assXmptions. It is simply a matter oI paying IXll and close attention to
       the givens oI liIe, i.e., to what is so ever-present that it is XsXally taNen
       Ior  granted. The trXe wonder oI the world is  available everywhere, in
       the minXtest parts oI oXr bodies, in  the vast e[panses oI the cosmos,
       and in the intimate interconnectedness oI these and all things… :e are
       part  oI  a Iinely  balanced ecosystem in  which interdependency goes
       hand-in-hand with  individXation.  :e    are all  individXals,  bXt we are
       also parts oI  a greater whole, Xnited in  something vast and beaXtiIXl
       beyond  description. Perception  oI  the  miracXloXs is  the sXbMective
       essence oI selI-realization, the root Irom which man’s highest IeatXres
       and e[periences grow. *

Speculative Model of Self-Realization,” Journal of Religion and Health Vol.
16, No. 1(1977), pp. 58-59.

         In thinNing aboXt miracles, I believe that  oXr Irame oI reIerence has
been too dramatic. :e  have been looNing Ior the bXrning bXsh, the parting
oI the sea, the bellowing voice Irom heaven. Instead we shoXld be looNing
at  the  ordinary   day-to-day  events  in   oXr  lives   Ior   evidence  oI   the
miracXloXs, maintaining at the same time  a scientiIic  orientation. This  is
what I shall be doing in the ne[t  section as I e[amine ordinary occXrrences
in the practice oI psychiatry which have led me to an Xnderstanding oI .the
e[traordinary phenomenon oI grace.
         BXt  I  woXld  liNe  to  conclXde  on  another note  oI   caXtion. This
interIace between science and religion can be shaNy, dangeroXs groXnd. :e
shall   be   dealing    with    e[trasensory   perception   and   “psychic”    or
“paranormal” phenomena as well as other varieties oI the miracXloXs. It is
essential that we Neep oXr wits aboXt Xs. I recently attended a conIerence on
the sXbMect oI Iaith healing at which a nXmber oI  well-edXcated speaNers
presented anecdotal evidence to indicate that they or others were possessors
oI  healing power  in  sXch a  manner as to  sXggest their  evidence to  be

185
rigoroXs and scientiIic when it was not. II a healer lays hands on a patient’s
inIlamed Moint and the ne[t day the Moint is no longer inIlamed, this does not
mean that the patient has been healed by the healer. InIlamed Moints XsXally
become XninIlamed sooner or later, slowly or sXddenly, no matter what is
done Xnto them. The Iact that two  events occXr together in time does not
necessarily mean that they are caXsally related. BecaXse this whole area is
so mXrNy and ambigXoXs, it is all the more important that we approach it
with healthy  sNepticism lest we mislead oXrselves and others. Among the
ways that others may be misled, Ior  instance, is by perceiving the lacN oI
sNepticism and rigoroXs reality-testing so oIten present in those individXals
who  are pXblic  proponents oI  the  reality  oI   psychic phenomena. SXch
individXals  give  the  Iield   a  bad  name.  BecaXse the  Iield  oI   psychic
phenomena attracts so many people with poor reality testing, it is tempting
Ior more realistic observers to conclXde that psychic phenomena themselves
are Xnreal althoXgh sXch is not the case. There are many who attempt to
Iind  simple  answers to  hard TXestions, marrying  popXlar scientiIic   and
religioXs concepts with high  hopes bXt little  thoXght. The Iact  that many
sXch marriages Iail  shoXld not be  taNen to mean that marriage  is either
impossible or inadvisable. BXt  MXst as it is essential that oXr sight not be
crippled by  scientiIic tXnnel vision,  so also is  it essential that oXr critical
IacXlties and capacity Ior sNepticism not be blinded by the brilliant  beaXty
oI the spiritXal realm.

Grace

187
         The  Miracle      of  Health


                Amazing grace! HoZ sZeet the sound
                That saYed a Zretch like me!
                I  once Zas lost, but noZ am found,
                Was blind, but noZ I see.

                T’Zas  grace that taught my heart to fear,
                And grace my fears relieYed;
                HoZ  precious did that grace appear
                The hour I first  belieYed!

                Through many dangers, toils and snares,
                I  haYe already come;
                ‘Tis  grace hath brought me safe thus far,
                And grace Zill  lead me home.

                And Zhen Ze’Ye been there ten thousand years,
                Bright  shining as the sun,
                We’ll  haYe no less days to sing God’s praise
                Then Zhen Ze first begin*
     *  “Amazing Grace,” by John Newton (1725-1807)

         The Iirst  word associated with grace in  this IamoXs early American
evangelical hymn is “amazing.” Something amazes Xs when it is not in the
ordinary coXrse oI things, when it  is not  predictable by what we  Nnow oI
“natXral  law.”  :hat     Iollows   will   demonstrate grace to   be  a  common
phenomenon and, to a certain e[tent, a predictable one. BXt the reality  oI
grace will    remain  Xne[plainable  within   the  conceptXal  IrameworN  oI
conventional science and “natXral law” as we Xnderstand it. It will  remain
miracXloXs and amazing.
         There are a  nXmber oI aspects oI the  practice oI  psychiatry which
never cease to amaze me as well as many other psychiatrists. One oI these
is the Iact that oXr patients are amazingly healthy mentally. It is cXstomary

188
Ior other medical specialists to accXse psychiatrists oI practicing an ine[act
and XnscientiIic discipline. The Iact oI the matter, however, is that more is
Nnown aboXt the caXses oI neXrosis than is Nnown aboXt the vast maMority
oI other hXman disorders. ThroXgh psychoanalysis it is possible to trace the
etiology and  development oI  a neXrosis in an  individXal  patient with  an
e[actitXde and precision that is seldom matched elsewhere in medicine. It is
possible to come to Nnow e[actly and precisely how, when, where and why
an individXal develops a particXlar neXrotic symptom or behavior pattern. It
is also possible to Nnow with eTXal e[actitXde and precision MXst how, when,
where and why a particXlar neXrosis can be cXred or has been healed. :hat
we do not Nnow, however, is why the neXrosis is not more severe—why oXr
mildly  neXrotic patient is not severely neXrotic, why oXr severely neXrotic
patient is not totally psychotic. Inevitably we Iind that a patient has sXIIered
a traXma or traXmas oI a  particXlar TXality so as to  prodXce a particXlar
neXrosis, bXt the traXmas are oI an intensity that in the ordinary course of
things shoXld have been e[pected to prodXce a neXrosis more severe than
the one the patient has.
         A thirty-Iive-year-old  remarNably sXccessIXl bXsinessman came to see
me becaXse oI a neXrosis that coXld only be described as mild. He was born
illegitimate, and throXgh inIancy and early childhood  was raised solely by
his mother, who was both de.aI and dXmb, in the slXms oI Chicago. :hen
he was Iive  years old  the state, believing  that  no sXch mother coXld  be
competent to raise a  child, tooN him  away  Irom  her withoXt  warning or
e[planation and placed him in a sXccession oI three Ioster homes, where he
was treated  to  rather  roXtine  indignities   and  with  a  total   absence oI
aIIection. At the age oI IiIteen he became partially paralyzed as the resXlt oI
a rXptXre oI a congenital aneXrysm oI one oI the blood vessels in his brain.
At si[teen he leIt  his Iinal set oI Ioster parents and began living by himselI.
Predictably, at the age oI seventeen he was Mailed Ior a particXlarly vicioXs
and meaningless assaXlt. He received no psychiatric treatment in Mail.
         Upon  his   release, aIter  si[    months  oI   boring  conIinement,  the
aXthorities got him a Mob as a menial stocN-room clerN in a rather ordinary
company. No   psychiatrist  or  social  worNer  in  the  world   woXld  have
Ioreseen his IXtXre as anything bXt grim. :ithin    three years, however, he
had become the yoXngest department head in the history oI the company. In
Iive  years, aIter  marrying   another e[ecXtive,  he  leIt  the  company  and

189
eventXally sXcceeded in his own bXsiness, becoming a relatively wealthy
man. By the time he entered treatment with me he had in addition become a
loving and eIIective Iather, a selI-edXcated intellectXal, a commXnity leader
and an  accomplished artist.  How,  when, why,  where  did  this  all  come
aboXt? :ithin   the ordinary concepts oI caXsality, I do  not Nnow. Together
we were able to trace with e[actitXde, within the XsXal IrameworN oI caXse
and eIIect, the determinants oI his mild neXrosis and heal him. :e were not
able in  the slightest degree to  determine the origins  oI his  Xnpredictable
sXccess.
         This case is TXoted precisely becaXse the observable traXmas were so
dramatic and  the circXmstances oI  his  sXccess so obvioXs. In  the  vast
maMority oI cases the traXmas oI childhood are considerably more sXbtle
(althoXgh XsXally eTXally  devastating) and  the  evidence oI  health  less
simple, bXt the pattern is basically the same. One seldom sees patients, Ior
instance, who are not  basically healthier mentally  than their  parents. :e
Nnow very well why people become mentally ill. :hat   we don’t Xnderstand
is why  people sXrvive the  traXmas oI their  lives as well  as they  do. :e
Nnow e[actly  why certain people commit  sXicide. :e   don’t  Nnow, within
the ordinary concepts oI caXsality, why certain others don’t commit sXicide.
All  we can say is that there is a Iorce,  the mechanics oI which we  do not
IXlly Xnderstand, that seems to operate roXtinely in most people to protect
and to Ioster their mental health even Xnder the most adverse conditions.
         AlthoXgh the processes involved in mental disorders IreTXently do not
correspond to  the  processes oI physical  disorders,  in  this  respect they
apparently do. :e    Nnow a great deal  more aboXt the caXses oI physical
disease than we do aboXt the caXses oI physical health. AsN any physician,
Ior   instance, what   caXses meningococcal  meningitis   and  the   instant
response will be, “:hy,   the meningococcXs, oI coXrse.” There is a problem
here, however. II this winter I were to maNe daily cXltXres oI this bacteriXm
Irom the throats oI the inhabitants oI the small village in  which I  maNe my
home, I woXld discover it living  there at some point in appro[imately  nine
oXt oI   ten people.  Yet  no  one  in  my   little  village   has sXIIered  Irom
meningococcal meningitis Ior many years, nor is liNely to do so this winter.
:hat    is  happening here? Meningococcal  meningitis  is  a relatively  rare
disease, yet the caXsative agent is e[tremely common. Physicians Xse the
concept oI resistance to e[plain this phenomenon, postXlating that the body

190
possesses a set oI deIenses that resist  invasion oI  the  body  cavities by
meningococcXs as well   as  a  whole  host  oI  other  XbiTXitoXs disease-
prodXcing organisms. There is  no TXestion that this  is  trXe; we  actXally
Nnow a good deal aboXt these deIenses and how they operate. BXt enormoXs
TXestions remain. :hile  some oI the people in the nation who will die Irom
meningococcal meningitis   this  winter  will    be  debilitated  or  otherwise
Nnown to  have  a deIective  resistance, the  maMority will   be previoXsly
healthy individXals with no Nnown deIects in their resistance systems. On a
certain level, we  will  be able to  say with  conIidence that meningococcXs
was the caXse ‘oI  their  death, bXt this  level  is clearly  sXperIicial.  On a
deeper level, we will not Nnow why they died. The most we will  be able to
say is that  the Iorces  that normally  protect  oXr lives  somehow Iailed  to
operate in them.
         AlthoXgh the concept oI resistance is most commonly applied to the
inIectioXs diseases, sXch as meningitis, it can also be applied to all physical
disease in one way or another, e[cept that in the instance oI noninIectioXs
disease we  have  almost  no  Nnowledge oI   how  resistance worNs.  An
individXal may sXIIer a single, relatively mild attacN oI Xlcerative colitis—a
disorder generally accepted to be psychosomatic—recover completely, and
go on to  live  throXgh liIe  withoXt ever again e[periencing  this  diIIicXlty.
Another may have repeated attacNs and become chronically crippled by the
disorder. A third  may demonstrate a IXlminating  coXrse and go on to die
rapidly Irom  even the Iirst attacN. The disease appears to be the same, bXt
the oXtcome is totally diIIerent.  :hy?   :e    have no idea e[cept to  say that
individXals with  a certain personality pattern seem .to have diIIerent types
oI diIIicXlty  in  resisting the disorder while the vast maMority oI Xs have no
diIIicXlty whatsoever. How does this happen? ·:e don’t  Nnow. These Ninds
oI TXestions can be asNed aboXt almost all  diseases, inclXding the most
common ones, sXch as heart  attacNs, stroNes, cancer, peptic Xlcers, and
0thers. An  increasing nXmber oI  thinNers are  beginning to  sXggest that
almost  all  disorders  are  psychosomatic—that the   psyche is   somehow
involved in the caXsation oI the varioXs IailXres that occXr in the resistance
system. BXt the amazing thing is not these IailXres oI the resistance system;
it is  that  the resistance system worNs as well as it  does. In  the ordinary
coXrse oI things we shoXld be eaten alive by bacteria, consXmed by cancer,
clogged Xp by Iats and clots, eroded by acids. It is hardly  remarNable that

191
we sicNen and die; what is trXly remarNable is that we don’t XsXally sicNen
very oIten and we  don’t die  very TXicNly. :e   can thereIore say the same
thing aboXt physical disorders that we said aboXt mental disorders: There is
a Iorce, the mechanism oI which we do not IXlly Xnderstand, that seems to
operate roXtinely in  most people to  protect and encoXrage their physical
health even Xnder the most adverse conditions.
         The matter  oI  accidents raises IXrther  interesting TXestions. Many
physicians and most psychiatrists have had the e[perience oI coming Iace to
Iace  with   the  phenomenon oI   accident  proneness. Among  the   many
e[amples in  my career the most dramatic  was that oI  a IoXrteen-year-old
boy whom  I  was  asNed to see as part oI  his  admission to  a residential
treatment center Ior delinTXent yoXths. His mother had died in the month oI
November oI his eighth year. In November oI his ninth  year he Iell Irom  a
ladder and IractXred his hXmerXs (Xpper arm). In November  oI  his tenth
year he was in a biNe accident and sXstained a IractXred sNXll and severe
concXssion. In November oI his  eleventh year he Iell  throXgh a sNylight,
IractXring  his  hip.  In  November  oI   his  twelIth   year he  Iell   Irom   his
sNateboard and IractXred his wrist. In November oI his  thirteenth year he
was hit by a car, sXstaining a IractXred pelvis. No one woXld TXestion that
this boy was indeed accident-prone, or the reason why. BXt how did these
accidents occXr? The boy  did not  conscioXsly caXse himselI to  be hXrt.
Neither was  he conscioXs oI  his  grieI  over  his mother’s  death, blandly
telling  me he  had “Iorgotten  all  aboXt her.”  To begin  to Xnderstand the
TXestion oI how  these accidents occXrred, I thinN  we need to  apply  the
concept oI  resistance to the phenomenon oI  accidents as well  as  to the
phenomenon oI disease, to thinN in terms oI accident-resistance as well as
accident-proneness. It is not simply that certain  people at certain times in
their lives are accident-prone; it is also that in the ordinary coXrse oI things
most oI Xs are accident-resistant.
         One winter  day  when  I  was nine,  carrying  my  booNs home Irom
school across a snowy street as the light was tXrning, I slipped and Iell. By
the time a rapidly approaching car sNidded to a stop my head was even with
the Iront Iender; my legs and torso were Xnderneath the middle oI the car. I
pXlled myselI   oXt Irom   Xnder the  car  and,  in  a  panic,  ran  oII  home
Xnharmed. By itselI this incident  does not seem so remarNable; one might
simply say  I  was lXcNy. BXt pXt it  together with  all  the  other instances:

192
times I MXst missed being hit by cars while on Ioot, on a bicycle or driving;
times when I  was  driving  a car  and almost  strXcN pedestrians or barely
missed biNe riders in the darN; times when I Mammed on the braNes, coming
to a stop no more than an inch or two  Irom another vehicle; times when  I
narrowly missed sNiing into trees, almost Iell oXt oI windows; times when a
swinging golI clXb brXshed throXgh my hair, and so on. :hat  is  this? Do I
lead a charmed e[istence? II readers e[amine their own lives at this point, I
sXspect the maMority will Iind  in  their  own  personal e[periences similar
patterns oI repeated narrowly averted disasters, a nXmber oI accidents that
almost happened that is many times greater than the nXmber oI accidents
that actXally did happen. FXrthermore, I believe readers will  acNnowledge
that their personal patterns oI  sXrvival, oI  accident-resistance, are not the
resXlt oI any process oI conscioXs decision-maNing. CoXld it be that most oI
Xs do lead “charmed lives”? CoXld it  really be that the  line in  the song is
trXe: “‘Tis grace hath broXght me saIe thXs Iar”?
         Some may thinN that there is nothing e[citing   aboXt all this, that all
the things  we have been  talNing aboXt are simply  maniIestations oI  the
sXrvival instinct.  BXt does the naming oI  something e[plain  it?  Does the
Iact that we  have an instinct to  sXrvive seem hXmdrXm becaXse we have
called it an instinct?  OXr Xnderstanding oI the origins and mechanisms oI
instincts is minXscXle at best. ActXally, the matter oI accidents sXggests that
oXr tendency toward sXrvival may be something other than, and even more
miracXloXs· than, an instinct, which is a phenomenon miracXloXs enoXgh in
itselI. :hile    we Xnderstand hardly anything aboXt instincts, we do conceive
oI them as operating within the boXndaries oI the individXal who possesses
them. Resistance to mental disorders or physical  disease we can imagine
being localized  within  the  XnconscioXs mind or bodily   processes oI the
individXal. Accidents, however, involve interactions between individXals or
between individXals and inanimate things. Did the wheels oI the man’s car
Iail  to rXn  over me when  I  was nine becaXse oI my  sXrvival instinct  or
becaXse the driver possessed an instinctXal resistance to Nilling me? Perhaps
we have an instinct not only to preserve oXr own lives bXt also to preserve
the lives oI others.
         :hile    I have personally not. e[perienced  this, I have several Iriends
who have witnessed aXtomobile accidents in which “victims” have crawled
virtXally intact oXt oI  vehicles smashed beyond recognition. Their reaction

193
has been one oI  pXre amazement. “I  don’t  see how  anyone coXld have
sXrvived sXch a wrecN at  all,  mXch less withoXt  serioXs inMXry!” is the
pronoXncement. How do we e[plain this? PXre chance? These Iriends, who
are not religioXs  people, were amazed precisely  becaXse chance did not
seem to be involved in these incidents. “No one coXld have sXrvived,” they
say. AlthoXgh not religioXs, and withoXt even thinNing deeply aboXt what
they were saying, in attempting to digest these e[periences my Iriends made
sXch remarNs as “:ell,  I  gXess God loves drXnNs” or “I gXess his nXmber
wasn’t Xp  yet.”  The  reader may  choose to  assign the  mystery oI  sXch
incidents to “pXre chance,” an Xne[plainable “TXirN” or a “twist oI Iate” and
be satisIied  thXs to close  the door  on  IXrther e[ploration.   II  we  are  to
e[amine  sXch incidents IXrther,  however, oXr  concept oI   an instinct  to
e[plain them is not terribly  satisIactory. Does the inanimate machinery oI a
motor vehicle possess an instinct to collapse itselI in MXst sXch a manner as
to preserve the contoXrs oI  the hXman body within?  Or  does the hXman
being possess an instinct at the moment oI impact to conIorm his contoXrs
to the pattern oI the collapsing machinery? SXch TXestions seem inherently
absXrd. :hile  I  choose to e[plore IXrther the possibility that sXch incidents
have an e[planation, it  is clear that oXr traditional  concept oI instinct will
not  be  oI   help.  OI   more  assistance perhaps will   be   the  concept  oI
synchronicity. BeIore considering the concept oI synchronicity, however, it
will  be helpIXl to Iirst e[amine  some aspects oI the IXnctioning oI that part
oI the hXman mind which we call the XnconscioXs.

         The  Miracle      of  the  Unconscious


         :hen   beginning to worN with  a new patient I will   IreTXently draw a
large circle. Then at the circXmIerence I will draw a small niche. Pointing to
the inside oI the niche, I say, “That represents yoXr conscioXs mind. All the
rest oI the circle,  95 percent or more, represents yoXr XnconscioXs. II yoX
worN long enoXgh and hard enoXgh to Xnderstand yoXrselI, yoX will come
to discover that this vast part  oI yoXr mind,  oI which  yoX now have little
awareness, contains riches beyond imagination.”
          One oI the ways, oI coXrse, that we Nnow oI the e[istence oI this vast
bXt hidden realm  oI  the mind  and the  wealth it  contains is  throXgh oXr

194
dreams. A man oI  some prominence came to see me Ior  a depression oI
many years’ dXration. He IoXnd no Moy in his worN, bXt had little idea why.
AlthoXgh his parents were relatively  poor and XnNnown, a nXmber oI his
Iather’s Iorebears had been IamoXs men. My patient made little mention oI
them. His depression was caXsed by many Iactors. Only aIter some months
did  we  begin  to  consider  the  matter  oI  his  ambition.   To  the  session
Iollowing  the  one in  which   the sXbMect oI ambition was Iirst   raised he
broXght a dream Irom the night beIore, a Iragment oI which  Iollows:  “:e
were in an apartment Iilled with hXge, oppressive pieces oI IXrnitXre. I was
mXch yoXnger than I am now. My Iather wanted me to sail across the bay to
picN Xp a boat he had Ior some reason leIt on an island across the bay. I was
eager to maNe this MoXrney and asNed him how I coXld Iind the boat. He
tooN me to one side where there was this particXlarly hXge and oppressive
piece oI   IXrnitXre,  an  enormoXs chest,  at  least twelve   Ieet  long  and
e[tending all the way Xp to the ceiling, with maybe twenty or thirty gigantic
drawers in it, and told me I coXld Iind the boat iI I sighted along the edge oI
the chest.”  Initially    the  meaning oI   the  dream was  Xnclear, so,  as  is
cXstomary, I   asNed him  to   associate to  this   hXge chest  oI   drawers.
Immediately he said, “For some reason—maybe becaXse the piece seemed
so oppressive—it  maNes me thinN oI  a  sarcophagXs.” “:hat    aboXt the
drawers,” I asNed. SXddenly he grinned. “Maybe I wanted to Nill oII all my
ancestors,” he said. “It maNes me thinN oI a Iamily tomb or vaXlt, each one
oI the drawers big enoXgh to hold a body.” The meaning oI the dream was
then clear. He had indeed in his yoXth been given a sighting, a sighting Ior
liIe, along the  tombs oI his IamoXs dead paternal ancestors, and had been
Iollowing  this sighting toward Iame. BXt he IoXnd it an oppressive Iorce in
his liIe and wished that he coXld psychologically Nill oII his ancestors so as
to be Iree Irom this compXlsive Iorce.
         Anyone who has worNed mXch with dreams will recognize this one to
be typical. I woXld liNe to IocXs on its helpIXlness as one oI the respects in
which it  is  typical.  This man  had started to worN  on a problem.  Almost
immediately his XnconscioXs prodXced a drama that elXcidated the caXse oI
his problem, a caXse oI which he had previoXsly been Xnaware. It did this
throXgh Xse oI   symbols  in  a  manner  as  elegant as  that  oI  the  most
accomplished playwright. It is diIIicXlt to imagine that any other e[perience
occXrring at this point in his therapy coXld have been as eloTXently ediIying

195
to him and me as this particXlar dream. His XnconscioXs dearly seemed to
want to assist him and oXr worN together, and did so with consXmmate sNill.
         It    is   precisely   becaXse  they    are   so   roXtinely   helpIXl    that
psychotherapists generally maNe the analysis oI dreams a signiIicant part oI
their worN. I mXst conIess that there are many dreams whose signiIicance
completely  elXdes me,  and  it  is  tempting   to  wish  petXlantly  that  the
XnconscioXs woXld oIten   have the  decency  to  speaN to  Xs  in  dearer
langXage. However, on those occasions when we sXcceed in maNing the
translation, the message always seems to be one designed to nXrtXre oXr
spiritXal  growth.   In   my   e[perience,  dreams  that   can  be  interpreted
invariably  provide  helpIXl  inIormation   to  the  dreamer. This   assistance
comes in a variety oI  Iorms: as warnings oI personal pitIalls;  as gXides to
the solXtion oI problems we have been Xnable to solve; as proper indication
that  we   are  wrong   when   we   thinN  we   are   right,   and  as   correct
encoXragement that we are right when we thinN we are probably wrong; as
soXrces oI necessary inIormation aboXt oXrselves that we are lacNing; as
direction-Iinders when we Ieel lost;  and as pointers to the way we need to
go when we are IloXndering.
         The XnconscioXs may commXnicate to Xs when we are awaNe with as
mXch elegance and beneIicence as  when we  are  asleep, althoXgh in  a
slightly  diIIerent   Iorm.   This  is  the  Iorm   oI  “idle   thoXghts,”  or   even
Iragments oI thoXghts. Most oI the time, as with dreams, we pay these idle
thoXghts no   attention  and  cast  them  aside  as  iI   they   were  withoXt
signiIicance.  It  is   Ior   this  reason that   patients in   psychoanalysis are
instrXcted again and again to say ZhateYer comes into their minds no matter
how silly  or  insigniIicant  it  may initially   seem. :henever   a patient says,
“It’s ridicXloXs, bXt this silly thoXght Neeps coming to my mind—it doesn’t
maNe any sense, bXt yoX’ve told me I have to say these things,” I Nnow that
we have hit pay dirt, that the patient has MXst received an e[tremely valXable
message Irom the XnconscioXs, a message that will signiIicantly illXminate
his or  her sitXation. :hile    these “idle  thoXghts”  XsXally provide Xs with
insight into oXrselves, they may also provide Xs with dramatic insights into
others or  into  the  world  oXtside oXrselves. As  an e[ample   oI  an “idle
thoXght” message Irom the XnconscioXs, and one that Ialls into the  latter
category, let me describe an e[perience  oI  my own  mind  while  worNing
with a  patient. The patient was a  yoXng woman who was sXIIering  since

196
early adolescence Irom a sensation oI dizziness, a sensation that she was
aboXt to topple over  any moment, Ior  which  no physical  caXse had ever
been IoXnd. BecaXse oI  this  sensation oI  dizziness  she walNed with   a
straight-legged, wide-based gait, almost a waddle. She was TXite intelligent
and charming, and initially  I  had no idea as to what might  be caXsing her
dizziness, oI which  psychotherapy oI  some years’ dXration had Iailed  to
cXre her, bXt  Ior  which   she had  nonetheless recently come  to  me  Ior
assistance. In the middle oI oXr third session, as she was comIortably seated
and talNing aboXt this or that, a single word sXddenly popped into my mind:
“Pinocchio.” I  was trying to concentrate on what my patient was saying, so
I immediately pXshed the word oXt oI conscioXsness. BXt within a minXte,
despite myselI, the  word came bacN into  my  mind,  almost visible,  as iI
spelled oXt in the bacN oI my eyes: P i n o c c h i o. Annoyed now, I blinNed
my eyes and Iorced my attention bacN to my patient. Yet, as iI it had a will
oI its  own, within  another minXte the word  was bacN into my awareness,
somehow demanding to be recognized. “:ait    a second,” I  Iinally   said to
myselI, “iI  this  word is  so an[ioXs to get  into my  mind, maybe I’d  better
damn well pay attention to it, becaXse I Nnow these things can be important,
and I Nnow iI my  XnconscioXs is trying to say something to me I oXght to
listen.”  So I  did. “Pinocchio!   :hat    the hell  coXld Pinocchio mean? YoX
don’t sXppose it coXld have anything to do with  my  patient, do yoX? YoX
don’t sXppose she’s Pinocchio, is she? Hey; wait a minXte; she’s cXte, liNe a
little doll.  She’s dressed in red, white and blXe. Each time she’s been here
she’s been dressed in red, white and blXe. She walNs IXnnily, liNe a stiII-
legged wooden  soldier. Hey,  that’s  it!  She’s  a pXppet. By   God, she  is
Pinocchio!  She’s  a  pXppet!”  Instantly  the  essence oI  the  patient  was
revealed to me: she was not  a real person; she was a stiII,  wooden  little
pXppet trying to act alive  bXt aIraid that at any moment she woXld topple
over  and collapse  in  a  tangle  oI   sticNs and  strings.  One  by  one  the
sXpporting Iacts rapidly emerged: an incredibly  domineering mother  who
pXlled strings, who  tooN great pride in  having toilet-trained  her daXghter
“overnight”;  a will  totally  devoted to IXlIilling  the e[ternal  e[pectations oI
others, to being  clean, neat, proper, tidy  and  saying all  the right  things,
Irantically  trying  to  MXggle the demands Xpon her; a total  lacN  oI  selI-
motivation and ability to maNe aXtonomoXs decisions.

197
         This immensely valXable insight aboXt my patient presented itselI to
my awareness as an Xnwelcome intrXder. I had not invited it. I did not want
it. Its presence seemed alien to me and irrelevant to the bXsiness in which I
was engaged, a needless distraction. Initially I resisted it, attempting several
times to NicN it oXt  the door throXgh which  it  had come. This seemingly
alien and Xnwanted TXality is characteristic oI XnconscioXs material and its
manner oI presentation to the conscioXs mind. It was partly becaXse oI this
TXality and the associated resistance oI the conscioXs mind that FreXd and
his initial  Iollowers  tended to perceive the XnconscioXs as a repository oI
the primitive, the antisocial and the evil within  Xs. It is as iI  they assXmed,
Irom  the Iact  that  oXr  conscioXsness did not want  it,   that XnconscioXs
material was  thereIore  “bad.”   Along  these  same lines,  they  tended to
assXme that mental illness somehow resided in the XnconscioXs as a demon
in the sXbterranean depths oI oXr mind. To JXng Iell  the responsibility oI
initiating  a  correction in  this  view,  which  he  did  in  a variety  oI  ways,
inclXding coining the phrase: “The :isdom    oI the UnconscioXs.” My own
e[perience has conIirmed JXng’s views in this  regard to the point where I
have come   to  conclXde  that  mental  illness   is  not  a   prodXct  oI  the
XnconscioXs; it is instead a phenomenon oI conscioXsness or a disordered
relationship between  the  conscioXs and  the XnconscioXs: Consider  the
matter oI repression, Ior instance. FreXd discovered in many oI his patients
se[Xal desires and hostile Ieelings oI which they were not aware yet which
were clearly maNing them ill. BecaXse these desires and Ieelings resided in
the XnconscioXs, the notion arose that it was the XnconscioXs that “caXsed”
mental illness.  BXt  why  were these  desires and Ieelings  located in  the
XnconscioXs in the Iirst place? :hy were they repressed? The answer is that
the conscioXs mind did not want  them. And  it is  in this  not-wanting, this
disowning, that  the problem  lies. The  problem is  not that  hXman beings
have sXch hostile and se[Xal Ieelings, bXt rather that hXman beings have a
conscioXs mind that is so oIten Xnwilling to Iace these Ieelings and tolerate
the pain oI dealing with  them, and that is  so willing  to sweep them Xnder
the rXg.
         A third  way in  which the XnconscioXs maniIests itselI and speaNs to
Xs iI we care to listen  (which we XsXally don’t)  is throXgh oXr behavior. I
am reIerring  to slips  oI  the tongXe and other “mistaNes”  in  behavior, or
“FreXdian slips,”  which  FreXd, in his  Psychopathology of EYeryday Life,

198
initially  demonstrated to be maniIestations oI the XnconscioXs. FreXd’s Xse
oI  the word  “psychopathology”   to  describe these phenomenon is again
indicative oI his negative orientation toward the XnconscioXs; he perceived
it as acting a spiteIXl role or at least a mischievoXs devil trying to trip Xs Xp
rather than seeing it as a Nind oI good Iairy worNing very hard to maNe Xs
honest. :hen     a  patient  maNes a  slip  in   psychotherapy, the  event  is
invariably helpIXl  to the process oI therapy or healing. At  these times the
conscioXs mind oI the patient is engaged in trying to combat therapy, intent
Xpon hiding the  trXe natXre oI the selI  Irom  the therapist and Irom  selI-
awareness. It is the XnconscioXs, however, that is allied with the therapist,
strXggling toward openness, honesty, trXth, and reality, Iighting to  “tell  it
liNe it is.”
         Let me give  some e[amples. A meticXloXs woman, totally Xnable to
acNnowledge in  herselI  the emotion  oI   anger and  thereIore  Xnable to
e[press anger openly, began a pattern oI arriving a Iew minXtes late Ior her
therapy sessions. I sXggested to her that this was becaXse she was Ieeling
some resentment toward me or toward therapy or both. She Iirmly  denied
that this was a possibility, e[plaining  that her lateness was pXrely a matter
oI this  or  that accidental Iorce  in  liIe  and proclaiming  her wholehearted
appreciation oI me and motivation  Ior  oXr worN together. On the evening
Iollowing  this session she paid her monthly  bills, inclXding  my own.  Her
checN to me arrived Xnsigned. At her ne[t  session I inIormed  her oI this,
sXggesting that she had not paid me properly, becaXse she was angry. She
said, “BXt that’s ridicXloXs! I have never in my liIe not signed a checN. YoX
Nnow how meticXloXs I am in these matters. It is impossible that I did not
sign yoXr  checN.” I  showed her  the Xnsigned checN. AlthoXgh  she had
always been e[tremely controlled in oXr sessions, she now sXddenly broNe
into sobs: “:hat    is happening to me?”  she wailed. “I’m   Ialling  apart. It’s
liNe I’m two  people.” In her agony, and with my  acNnowledgment that she
was indeed liNe a hoXse divided against itselI, she began Ior the Iirst time to
accept the possibility that at least a part oI her might  harbor the Ieeling oI
anger. The Iirst step oI progress was made. Another patient with a problem
with anger was a  man who believed it  Xnconscionable to Ieel, mXch less
e[press, anger toward any  member oI  his Iamily.  BecaXse his sister was
visiting  him at the  time, he was telling  me aboXt her, describing her as a
“perIectly delightIXl person.” Later in the session he began telling me aboXt

199
a small  dinner  party  he was  hosting  that night,  which,  he  said,  woXld
inclXde a neighboring coXple and “oI  coXrse, my sister-in-law.”  I pointed
oXt to him that he had MXst reIerred to his sister as sister-in-law. “I sXppose
yoX’re going to  tell  me this is  one oI  those FreXdian slips,” he remarNed
blithely. “Yes,  I  am,” I  replied.  “:hat    yoXr XnconscioXsness is saying is
that yoX  don’t  want yoXr  sister to  be  yoXr sister, that  as Iar  as  yoX’re
concerned, she’s yoXr sister-in-law  only,  and that  actXally yoX  hate her
gXts.” “I don’t  hate her gXts,” he responded, “bXt she does talN incessantly,
and  I   Nnow  that  at   dinner  tonight   she  will    monopolize  the   whole
conversation. I gXess maybe I am embarrassed by her sometimes.” Again a
small beginning was made.
         Not  all  slips  e[press hostility   or denied  “negative”  Ieelings.  They
e[press all denied Ieelings, negative or positive. They e[press the trXth, the
way things  really  are as opposed to  the way  we  liNe to  thinN they  are.
Perhaps the most toXching slip oI the tongXe in my e[perience was made by
a yoXng woman on her initial visit with me. I Nnew her parents to be distant
and insensitive individXals who had raised her with a great deal oI propriety
bXt an absence oI aIIection or genXine caring. She presented herselI to me
as an XnXsXally matXre, selI-conIident, liberated and independent woman oI
the world who soXght treatment Irom me becaXse, she e[plained, “I am sort
oI at loose ends Ior the moment, with time on my hands, and I thoXght that
a  little    bit    oI   psychoanalysis  might    contribXte  to   my    intellectXal
development.” InTXiring as to why she was at loose ends at the moment, I
learned that she  had MXst dropped oXt oI college  becaXse she was Iive
months’ pregnant. She did not want to get married. She vagXely thoXght she
might pXt the baby Xp Ior adoption Iollowing its  delivery and then proceed
to EXrope Ior IXrther edXcation. I asNed her iI she had inIormed the Iather oI
the baby, whom she had not seen Ior IoXr months, oI her pregnancy. “Yes,”
she said, “I did drop him  a little  note to let him Nnow that oXr relationship
was the prodXct oI a child.” Meaning to say that a child was the prodXct oI
their relationship, she had instead told  me that Xnderneath her masN oI a
woman oI the world she was a hXngry little girl,  starved Ior aIIection, who
had gotten pregnant in a desperate attempt to obtain mothering by becoming
herselI a mother. I did not conIront her with her slip, becaXse she was not at
all ready to accept her dependency needs or e[perience them as being saIe
to have. Nonetheless, the slip was helpIXl to  her by helping  me be aware

200
that the person really seeing me was a Irightened yoXng child who needed
to be met with protective gentleness and the simplest, almost physical Nind
oI nXrtXre possible Ior a long time to come.
         These  three  patients  who  made  slips   were  not   trying   to  hide
themselves Irom me as mXch as Irom themselves. The Iirst really believed
that there  was  no shred  oI  resentment in  her.  The  second was  totally
convinced that he bore no animosity toward any member oI his Iamily. The
last thoXght oI  herselI  in  no other  way  than as a  woman oI  the  world.
ThroXgh a comple[  oI  Iactors, oXr conscioXs selI-concept almost always
diverges to a  greater or lesser degree Irom  the  reality oI  the  person we
actXally are. :e   are almost always either less or more competent than we
believe oXrselves to be. The XnconscioXs, however, Nnows who we really
are. A maMor and essential tasN in the process oI one’s spiritXal development
is  the  continXoXs worN  oI  bringing   one’s  conscioXs selI-concept  into
progressively greater congrXence with reality.  :hen    a  large part  oI  this
liIelong  tasN is accomplished with relative  rapidity, as it  may  be throXgh
intensive psychotherapy, the individXal will  oIten Ieel “reborn.”  “I  am not
the person I was,” a patient will say with real Moy aboXt the dramatic change
in his or her conscioXsness; “I am a totally new and diIIerent person.” SXch
a person has no diIIicXlty in Xnderstanding the words oI the song: “I  once
was lost, bXt now am IoXnd, was blind, bXt now I see.”
         II  we  identiIy  oXr  selI  with  oXr selI-concept  or  selI-awareness or
conscioXsness in general, then we mXst say concerning the XnconscioXs that
there is a part oI  Xs that is  wiser than we are. :e    have talNed aboXt this
“wisdom oI the XnconscioXs” primarily in terms oI selI-Nnowledge and selI-
revelation. In the e[ample oI my patient whom my XnconscioXs revealed to
me to  be Pinocchio,  I  attempted to  demonstrate that the XnconscioXs is
wiser than we are aboXt other people as well as oXrselves. The Iact oI the
matter is  that  oXr  XnconscioXs is wiser  than  we are  aboXt everything.
Having arrived aIter darN on a vacation in Singapore Ior the Iirst time,  my
wiIe and I leIt  oXr hotel Ior a stroll. :e   soon came to a large open space at
the Iar end oI which,  two or three blocNs away, we coXld MXst maNe oXt in
the darNness the vagXe shape oI a sizable bXilding. “I  wonder  what that
bXilding is,”  my  wiIe  said. I immediately  answered with casXal and total
certainty, “Oh, that’s the Singapore CricNet ClXb.” The words had popped
oXt oI  my moXth  with  Xtter spontaneity. Almost  immediately I  regretted

201
them. I had no basis whatever Ior saying them. I had not only never been in
Singapore beIore, I had never seen a cricNet clXb beIore in daylight, mXch
less in darNness. Yet to my amazement, as we walNed on and came to the
other side oI the bXilding, which was its Iront,  there by the entrance was a
brass plaTXe reading Singapore Cricket Club.
         How  did  I  Nnow this which  I  did  not  Nnow? Among  the possible
e[planations, one is that oI JXng’s theory oI the “collective XnconscioXs,” in
which we  inherit  the wisdom  oI the  e[perience oI  oXr ancestors withoXt
oXrselves having the personal e[perience. :hile     this  Nind oI  Nnowledge
may seem bizarre to the scientiIic  mind, strangely enoXgh its e[istence is
recognized in oXr common everyday langXage. TaNe the word “recognize”
itselI. :hen   we  are reading a booN and come across an idea or theory that
appeals to Xs, that “rings a bell” with  Xs, we “recognize” it  to be trXe. Yet
this idea or theory may be one oI which we have never beIore conscioXsly
thoXght. The word says we “re-Nnow”  the concept, as iI we Nnew it  once
Xpon a time, Iorgot it, bXt then recognized it as an old Iriend. It  is as iI all
Nnowledge and all wisdom were contained in oXr minds, and when we learn
“something new” we are actXally only discovering something that e[isted in
oXr  selI  all   along.   This  concept  is   similarly   reIlected   in   the  word
“edXcation,” which is derived Irom the Latin educare, literally  translated as
“to bring  oXt oI”  or “to  lead Iorth.”  ThereIore when we edXcate people, iI
we Xse the word serioXsly, we do not stXII something new into their minds;
rather, we lead  this  something oXt oI  them;  we  bring  it  Iorth  Irom  the
XnconscioXs into  their   awareness. They   were  the   possessors oI  the
Nnowledge all along.
         BXt what is its soXrce, this part oI Xs that is wiser than we are? :e do
not Nnow JXng’s theory  oI  the  collective  XnconscioXs sXggests that oXr
wisdom is inherited. Recent scientiIic e[periments with  genetic material in
conMXnction with the phenomenon oI  memory  sXggest that it  is  indeed
possible to inherit Nnowledge, which is  stored in the Iorm  oI nXcleic acid
codes within cells. The concept oI  chemical storage oI inIormation allows
Xs to begin to Xnderstand how the inIormation potentially  available to the
hXman mind might be stored in a , Iew cXbic inches oI brain sXbstance. BXt
even this  e[traordinary  sophisticated model, allowing   Ior  the storage oI
inherited  as  well  as  e[periential   Nnowledge in   a  small  space, leaves
Xnanswered the most mind-boggling TXestions. :hen we  specXlate on the

202
technology  oI    sXch  a   model—how   it   might    be   constrXcted, how
synchronized, and so on—we are still leIt  standing in total awe beIore the
phenomenon oI the hXman mind.  SpecXlation on these matters is hardly
diIIerent in TXality Irom specXlation aboXt sXch models oI cosmic control as
God having  at  His  command  armies and  choirs  oI  archangels, angels,
seraphims and cherXbims to assist Him in the tasN oI ordering the Xniverse.
The mind, which sometimes presXmes to believe that there is no sXch thing
as a miracle, is itselI a miracle.

         The  Miracle      of  Serendipity


         :hile    it  is perhaps possible Ior  Xs to conceive oI the  e[traordinary
wisdom oI  the XnconscioXs, as discXssed thXs Iar, as being an Xltimately
e[plainable part oI a molecXlar brain operating with miracXloXs technology,
we   still    have   no   conceivable   e[planation    Ior    so-called   “psychic
phenomena,” which are clearly related to the operation oI the XnconscioXs.
In  a  series oI  sophisticated e[periments   MontagXe Ullman,  M.D.,   and
Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., conclXsively demonstrated that it is possible Ior an
awaNe individXal to repeatedly and roXtinely “transmit” images to another
individXal sleeping many rooms away, and that these images will appear in
the dreams oI the sleeper. *

Three Studies,” American Journal of Psychiatry (March 1970), pp. 1282-89.
Anyone as yet  unconvinced about the  reality  of  ESP or  skeptical  of its
scientific validity is urged to read this article.

         SXch transmission does not occXr only in the laboratory. For instance,
it   is   not  Xncommon  Ior    two   individXals   Nnown  to   each  other  to
independently have the same or incredibly similar  dreams. How does this
happen? :e don’t  have the Iaintest idea.
         BXt happen it does. The validity  oI sXch happenings is scientiIically
proven in terms oI  their  probability. I  myselI  had a dream one night  that
consisted oI a series oI  seven images. I later learned that  a Iriend,  while
sleeping in my hoXse two nights previoXsly, had awaNened Irom a dream in
which the  same seven images occXrred in the  same seTXence. He and I

203
coXld not determine any reason Ior this happening. :e were Xnable to relate
the dreams to any e[perience we had had, shared or otherwise, nor were we
able to  interpret  the dreams in  any  meaningIXl way.  Yet we  Nnew that
something most signiIicant   had happened. My  mind  has  available to  it
millions oI images Irom which to constrXct a dream. The probability that by
chance alone I woXld select the same seven as my Iriend had in the same
seTXence was astronomically low. The event was so implaXsible  that we
Nnew it coXld not have occXrred by accident.
         The Iact  that highly  implaXsible events, Ior  which no  caXse can be
determined within    the  IrameworN  oI  Nnown  natXral  law,  occXr  with
implaXsible  IreTXency  has  come  to   be   Nnown  as  the   principle   oI
synchronicity. My Iriend  and I don’t Nnow the caXse or reason why we had
sXch implaXsibly similar dreams, bXt one aspect oI the event was that we
had them close in time. Somehow the timing seems the important, perhaps
even crXcial element in these implaXsible events. Earlier, in the discXssion
oI  accident-proneness and -resistance, it was mentioned that  people not
inIreTXently walN Xnharmed oXt oI  vehicles crXshed beyond recognition,
and it   seemed ridicXloXs to   specXlate that the  machinery  instinctively
crXmpled in a conIigXration to protect the  rider or that the  rider crXmpled
instinctively in  a Iorm to  Iit the machinery. There is no Nnown natXral law
whereby the  conIigXration oI  the  vehicle (Event  A)  caXsed the rider  to
sXrvive, or the Iorm oI the rider (Event B) caXsed the vehicle to crXmple in
a certain way. Nonetheless, althoXgh one did not caXse the other, Event A
and Event B implaXsibly occXrred synchronoXsly—that is, together in time
—in  sXch a  way   that  the  rider  did  in   Iact  sXrvive.  The  principle  oI
synchronicity does not e[plain  why or  how this happened; it simply  states
that sXch implaXsible conMXnctions oI events in time occXr more IreTXently
than woXld be predicted by chance alone. It does not e[plain miracles. The
principle serves only to  maNe it clear that miracles seem to be matters oI
timing and matters that are amazingly commonplace.
         The incident  oI the  similar, almost  synchronoXs dreams is one that
TXalities by virtXe oI  its  statistical improbability  as a  genXine psychic or
“paranormal”  phenomenon even thoXgh  the meaning  oI  the  incident  is
obscXre. Probably the meaning oI at least the maMority oI genXine psychic,
paranormal  phenomena   is   similarly     obscXre.  Nonetheless,   another
characteristic   oI    psychic   phenomena,   apart   Irom    their    statistical

204
implaXsibility, is that a signiIicant  nXmber oI sXch occXrrences seem to be
IortXnate—in some way beneIicial to one or more oI the hXman participants
involved. A  matXre, highly  sNeptical and respectable scientist in analysis
with  me  MXst recently recoXnted the Iollowing  incident:  “AIter   oXr last
session, it was sXch a beaXtiIXl day, I decided to drive home by the roXte
aroXnd the laNe. As yoX Nnow, the road aroXnd the laNe has a great many
blind cXrves. I was approaching perhaps the tenth oI these cXrves when the
thoXght sXddenly occXrred to me  that a  car coXld be  racing aroXnd the
corner Iar into my  side oI the road. :ithoXt    any more thoXght than that, I
vigoroXsly braNed my car and came to a dead stop. No sooner had I done
this than a car did indeed come barreling aroXnd the cXrve with its wheels
si[  Ieet across the yellow  line  and barely  missed me even thoXgh I  was
standing still on my side oI the road. Had I not stopped, it is inevitable that
we woXld have collided at the cXrve. I have no idea what made me decide
to stop. I coXld have stopped at anyone oI a dozen other cXrves, bXt I didn’t.
I’ve traveled that  road many times beIore, and while I’ve  had the thoXght
that it  was  dangeroXs, I’ve  never stopped beIore.  It  maNes me wonder
whether there really  isn’t  something to ESP and  things liNe that. I  don’t
have any other e[planation.”
         It is  possible that occXrrences statistically improbable to a degree to
sXggest they are e[amples oI synchronicity or the paranormal are as liNely
to be harmIXl as they are beneIicial. :e   hear oI IreaN accidents as well as
IreaN nonaccidents. Even thoXgh IXll oI methodologic pitIalls, research into
this issXe clearly needs to be done. At this time I can state only a very Iirm
bXt  “XnscientiIic”   impression  that  the   IreTXency oI   sXch  statistically
improbable occXrrences that are clearly beneIicial is Iar greater than that in
which   the  resXlt  seems  detrimental.  The   beneIicial   resXlts  oI   sXch
occXrrences need not be liIesaving;  Iar more  oIten they  are simply  liIe-
enhancing  or   growth-prodXcing.  An    e[cellent   e[ample    oI   sXch  an
occXrrence is the “scarab dream” e[perience oI Carl JXng, recoXnted in his
article “On Synchronicity”  and TXoted here in toto: *

1971), pp. 511-12.

                My  e[ample  concerns a yoXng woman patient, who, in spite oI
       eIIorts made on both sides, proved to be psychologically inaccessible.

205
       The  diIIicXlty   lay   in  the  Iact  that  she  always Nnew  better  aboXt
       everything.  Her e[cellent  edXcation had provided her with  a weapon
       ideally  sXited  to  this  pXrpose, namely a  highly  polished  Cartesian
       rationalism  with  an  impeccably “geometrical”   idea oI  reality.  AIter
       several IrXitless attempts to sweeten her rationalism with a somewhat
       more hXman Xnderstanding, I had to conIine myselI  to the  hope that
       something Xne[pected and irrational woXld tXm Xp, something which
       woXld  bXrst the intellectXal retort into  which  she had sealed herselI.
       :ell,    I was sitting  opposite her one day, with my bacN to the window,
       listening to  her Ilow oI  rhetoric. She had had an impressive dream the
       night  beIore,  in  which  someone had given  her a  golden scarab—a
       costly  piece oI  Mewelry. :hile  she was  still  telling  me this dream, I
       heard something behind  me gently tapping  on the  window. I  tXrned
       aroXnd and  saw  that  it  was  a  Iairly   large  Ilying   insect  that  was
       NnocNing against the window  pane Irom  the oXtside in  the obvioXs
       eIIort  to  get into  the darN room. This  seemed to me very  strange. I
       opened the window immediately  and caXght the insect in the air as it
       Ilew  in.  It  was a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chaIer (Cetonia
       aXrata), whose gold-green color most nearly resembles that oI a golden
       scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words, “Here is yoXr
       scarab.” The e[perience pXnctXred the desired hole in her rationalism,
       and broNe the ice  oI her  intellectXal resistance. The treatment coXld
       now be continXed with satisIactory resXlts.

         :hat    we  are talNing oI  here  in  regard to  paranormal events with
beneIicial  conseTXences is the   phenomenon oI   serendipity.  :ebster’s
Dictionary deIines serendipity as “the giIt  oI Iinding  valXable or agreeable
things  not  soXght  Ior.”   There  are  several  intrigXing   IeatXres to   this
deIinition. One is the terming oI serendipity as a giIt, thereby implying that
some people possess it while others don’t, that some people are lXcNy and
others are not. It is a maMor thesis oI this section that grace, maniIested in
part by   “valXable  or  agreeable things  not  soXght Ior,”   is  available  to
everyone, bXt that while some taNe advantage oI it, others do not. By letting
the beetle in, catching it, and giving it to his patient, JXng was clearly taNing
advantage oI it. Some oI the reasons why and ways that people Iail to taNe
advantage oI grace  will  be  e[plored  later  Xnder the  sXbMect heading oI

206
“Resistance to Grace.” BXt Ior the  moment let me sXggest that one oI the
reasons we Iail to taNe IXll advantage oI grace is that we are not IXlly aware
oI  its  presence—that is,  we don’t   Iind  valXable  things not  soXght Ior,
becaXse we Iail to appreciate the valXe oI the giIt  when it  is given  Xs. In
other words, serendipitoXs events occXr to all oI Xs, bXt IreTXently we Iail to
recognize  their  serendipitoXs  natXre;  we   consider  sXch  events  TXite
XnremarNable, and conseTXently we Iail to taNe IXll advantage oI them.
         Five months ago, having two hoXrs to spend between appointments in
a certain town, I asNed a colleagXe who lived there iI I coXld spend them in
the library oI his  hoXse worNing on the rewriting oI the Iirst section oI this
booN. :hen   I  got there I  was met by  my colleagXe’s wiIe,  a distant and
reserved woman who had never seemed to care Ior me very mXch and had
been actXally hostile to me on several occasions in an almost arrogant way.
:e    chatted awNwardly  Ior  perhaps Iive  minXtes. In   the coXrse oI   oXr
sXperIicial conversation she said  she’d heard I   was writing   a booN and
asNed aboXt the sXbMect. I told her it concerned spiritXal growth and did not
elaborate IXrther. I then sat down in the library to worN. :ithin a halI hoXr I
had rXn into  a snag. A   portion oI  what  I  had written  on  the sXbMect oI
responsibility seemed completely XnsatisIactory to me. It clearly had to be
e[tensively  enlarged  in  order  to  maNe meaningIXl  the  concepts I  had
discXssed therein, yet I Ielt this enlargement woXld detract Irom the Ilow oI
the worN. On the other hand, I was Xnwilling to delete the section entirely,
since I Ielt  that some mention oI these concepts was necessary. I wrestled
with this dilemma Ior  an hoXr, getting absolXtely nowhere, becoming more
and more IrXstrated, Ieeling more and more helpless to resolve the sitXation.
         At  this point  my colleagXe’s wiIe TXietly came into  the library.  Her
manner was timid  and hesitant, respectIXl, yet  somehow warm and soIt,
TXite XnliNe that in any encoXnter I had had with her previoXsly. “Scotty, I
hope I’m  not intrXding,”  she said.  “II  I  am, tell  me.”  I  told  her that she
wasn’t, that I’d  hit a snag and was not going to be able to maNe any more
progress Ior the moment. In  her hands she was carrying  a little  booN. “I
happened to Iind this booN,” she said. “Somehow I  thoXght yoX might be
interested in it. Probably yoX won’t be. BXt the thoXght occXrred to me that
it  might  be  helpIXl  to  yoX.  I  don’t   Nnow why.”   Feeling  irritated  and
pressXred, I might ordinarily have told her that I was Xp to my ears in booNs
—which was trXe—and there was no way I coXld get aroXnd to reading it in

207
the Ioreseeable IXtXre. BXt her strange hXmility evoNed a diIIerent response.
I told  her I appreciated her Nindness and woXld try to get to it  as soon as
possible. I tooN it home with me, not Nnowing when “as soon as possible”
might be. BXt that  very evening something compelled me to  pXt aside all
the other booNs I was consXlting to read hers. It was a slim volXme entitled,
“How  People Change,” by Allen  :heelis.   MXch oI  it  concerned issXes oI
responsibility. One chapter elegantly e[pressed in depth what I woXld have
tried to say had I  enlarged the diIIicXlt section in  my own booN. The ne[t
morning I condensed the section oI my booN to a small concise paragraph,
and in  a  Iootnote reIerred  the reader to  the  :heelis    booN Ior  an  ideal
elaboration oI the sXbMect. My dilemma was solved.
         This was not a stXpendoXs event. There were no trXmpets to annoXnce
it.  I   might   well   have  ignored  it.   I   coXld  have  sXrvived  withoXt  it.
Nonetheless, I was toXched by grace. The event was both e[traordinary and
ordinary—e[traordinary  becaXse it was highly  XnliNely, ordinary becaXse
sXch highly XnliNely beneIicial  events happen to Xs all  the time,  TXietly,
NnocNing on the door oI oXr awareness no more dramatically than the beetle
gently tapping on the windowpane. Similar  sorts oI events have happened
dozens oI times in the months since my colleagXe’s wiIe lent me her booN.
They have always been happening to me. Some oI them I recognize. Some
oI  them  I  may  taNe advantage oI   withoXt  even  being  aware oI   their
miracXloXs natXre. There is no way I have oI Nnowing how many I have let
slip by.

         The  Definition       of  Grace


         ThXs  Iar  in   this   section  I   have  described  a  whole  variety   oI
phenomena that have the Iollowing characteristics in common:
         (a) They serve to nXrtXre—sXpport, protect and enhance—hXman liIe
and spiritXal growth.
         (b)   The    mechanism   oI    their   action    is   either    incompletely
Xnderstandable (as in the case oI physical. resistance and dreams) or totally
obscXre (as  in  the  case  oI  paranormal  phenomena) according  to   the
principles ‘oI natXral law as interpreted by cXrrent scientiIic thinNing.

208
         (c)   Their    occXrrence  is   IreTXent,  roXtine,   commonplace   and
essentially Xniversal among hXmanity.
         (d)  AlthoXgh potentially  inIlXenced  by hXman conscioXsness, their
origin is oXtside oI the conscioXs will and beyond the process oI conscioXs
decision-maNing.
         AlthoXgh generally regarded as separate, I have come to believe that
their   commonality   indicates   that  these   phenomena  are  part   oI   or
maniIestations oI   a  single  phenomenon:  a  powerIXl  Iorce   originating
oXtside oI  hXman conscioXsness which nXrtXres the spiritXal  growth  oI
hXman beings. For   hXndreds and even  thoXsands oI  years  beIore  the
scientiIic  conceptXalization oI  sXch things  as immXne  globXlins, dream
states, and the XnconscioXs, this Iorce has been consistently recognized by
the religioXs, who have applied to it the name oI grace. And have sXng its
praise: “Amazing grace, how sweet the soXnd . . . “
         :hat    are we to  do—we  who are  properly sNeptical and scientiIic-
minded—with   this    “powerIXl    Iorce   originating    oXtside   oI   hXman
conscioXsness which nXrtXres the spiritXal growth oI hXman beings”? :e
cannot toXch this Iorce. :e  have no decent way to measXre it. Yet it e[ists.
It is real. Are we to operate with tXnnel vision and ignore it becaXse it does
not Iit in  easily with traditional scientiIic  concepts oI natXral law? To do so
seems periloXs. I do not thinN we can hope to approach a IXll Xnderstanding
oI the cosmos, oI the place oI man within the cosmos, and hence the natXre
oI manNind itselI, withoXt incorporating the phenomenon oI grace into oXr
conceptXal IrameworN.
         Yet we cannot even locate this Iorce. :e    have said only where it  is
not: residing in hXman conscioXsness. Then, where does it reside? Some oI
the phenomena we  have discXssed, sXch as dreams, sXggest that grace
resides in the XnconscioXs mind oI the individXal. Other phenomena, sXch
as synchronicity  and serendipity, indicate  this  Iorce to  e[ist   beyond the
boXndaries oI  the  single  individXal.   It  is   not  simply  becaXse we  are
scientists that we  have diIIicXlty   locating  grace. The  religioXs, who,  oI
coXrse, ascribe the origins oI grace to God, believing it to be literally God’s
love, have throXgh the ages had the same diIIicXlty locating God. There are
within theology two lengthy  and opposing traditions in this regard: one, the
doctrine oI  Emanance, which  holds  that grace  emanates down Irom  an

209
e[ternal God  to men;  the other, the doctrine  oI Immanence, which  holds
that grace immanates oXt Irom the God within the center oI man’s being.
         This problem—and, Ior that matter, the whole problem oI  parado[—
resXlts Irom oXr desire, in the  Iirst place, to  locate things. HXman beings
have a proIoXnd tendency to conceptXalize in terms oI discrete entities. :e
perceive the world composed oI sXch entities: ships, shoes and sealing wa[,
and other categories. And we  then tend to  Xnderstand a phenomenon by
placing it in a particXlar category, saying it is sXch and” sXch an entity. It is
either this” or that, bXt it cannot be both. Ships are ships and not shoes. I am
I and yoX are yoX.  The I-entity  is my  identity  and the yoX-entity  is yoXr
identity, and we tend to be TXite discomIited iI oXr identities become mi[ed
Xp or conIXsed. As we have previoXsly noted, HindX and BXddhist thinNers
believe oXr  perception oI  discrete  entities to  be  illXsion,  or  maya, and
modem physicists,  concerned with   relativity,  wave-particle  phenomena,
electromagnetism, et  cetera,  are  becoming  increasingly   aware  oI  the
limitations oI  oXr conceptXal approach in terms oI entities. BXt it is hard to
escape Irom. OXr tendency to entity-thinNing compels Xs to want to locate
things, even sXch things  as God or  grace and  even when we  Nnow oXr
tendency is interIering with oXr comprehension oI these matters.
         I  attempt not  to thinN oI  the  individXal  as a trXe entity  at all,  and
insoIar as my intellectXal limitations compel me to thinN (or write) in terms
oI entities, I  conceive oI the boXndaries oI the individXal as being marNed
by a most permeable membrane—a Ience, iI yoX will, instead oI  a wall; a
Ience throXgh which,  Xnder which  and over  which  other “entities”   may
climb, crawl  or  Ilow.  JXst as oXr conscioXs mind is  continXally partially
permeable to oXr  XnconscioXs, so is  oXr XnconscioXs permeable to the
“mind”  withoXt, the “mind”  that permeates Xs yet is not Xs as entities. More
elegantly and  adeTXately descriptive oI  the sitXation  than the  twentieth
centXry scientiIic  langXage oI  permeable  membranes is the  IoXrteenth-
centXry (c.  1393)  religioXs  langXage oI  Dame  JXlian, an  anchoress oI
Norwich,  describing  the  relationship  between grace  and the  individXal
entity: “For as the body is clad in the cloth, and the Ilesh in the sNin and the
bones in the Ilesh and the heart in the whole, so are we, soXl and body, clad
in the goodness oI God and enclosed. Yea, and more homely; Ior all these
may wear and waste away, bXt the Goodness oI God is ever whole.” *

         In any  case, regardless oI how we ascribe them or where we locate
them, the “miracles” described indicate that oXr growth as hXman beings is
being  assisted by   a  Iorce  other  than  oXr  conscioXs  will.   To  IXrther
Xnderstand the  natXre  oI   this  Iorce   I   believe  we   can  beneIit   Irom
considering yet  another miracle:  the growth  process oI  all  liIe  itselI,  to
which we have given the name evolXtion.

         The  Miracle      of  EYolution


         AlthoXgh we have not Xntil now IocXsed Xpon it as a concept, in one
way or  another we  have been concerned with  evolXtion  throXghoXt this
booN. SpiritXal growth  is  the evolXtion  oI  an individXal  An  individXal’s
body may Xndergo the changes oI the liIe cycle, bXt it does not evolve. New
physical patterns are not Iorged. Decline oI physical competence in old age
is an inevitability. :ithin     an individXal liIetime,  however, the hXman spirit
may   evolve   dramatically.   New   patterns   may   be   Iorged.   SpiritXal
competence may increase (althoXgh it XsXally does not) Xntil the moment oI
death in advanced old age. OXr liIetime oIIers Xs Xnlimited opportXnities Ior
spiritXal growth Xntil  the end. :hile    the IocXs oI this booN is on spiritXal
evolXtion, the process oI physical evolXtion is  similar  to that oI  the spirit
and provides Xs with a model Ior the IXrther Xnderstanding oI the process oI
spiritXal growth and the meaning oI grace.
         The most striNing IeatXre oI the process oI physical evolXtion is that it
is a miracle. Given  what we Xnderstand oI the Xniverse, evolXtion shoXld
not occXr; the phenomenon shoXld not e[ist at all. One oI the basic natXral
laws  is  the  second law   oI  thermodynamics,  which  states  that  energy
natXrally Ilows  Irom  a  state oI  greater organization  to  a state oI  lesser
organization, Irom  a  state oI   higher  diIIerentiation  to  a  state oI  lower
diIIerentiation.  In  other words,  the  Xniverse is in   a process oI  winding
down. The  e[ample IreTXently  Xsed to describe this process is that  oI  a
stream, .which natXrally Ilows downhill.  It  taNes energy or worN—pXmps,
locNs, hXmans carrying bXcNets, or other means to reverse this process, to

211
get bacN to the beginning, to pXt the water bacN on top oI the hill. And this
energy has to come Irom somewhere else. Some other energy system has to
be depleted iI  this  one is to  be maintained.  Ultimately,  according to  the
second law  oI   thermodynamics, in   billions   and billions   oI   years, the
Xniverse will completely wind  down Xntil it  reaches the lowest point as an
amorphoXs, totally disorganized, totally  XndiIIerentiated “blob”   in  which
nothing  happens  any   more.  This   state  oI   total   disorganization  and
XndiIIerentiation is termed entropy.
         The natXral downhill Ilow oI energy toward the state oI entropy might
be termed the  Iorce  oI  entropy. :e    can now  realize that  the “Ilow”    oI
evolXtion is against the Iorce oI entropy. The process oI evolXtion has been
a development oI  organisms Irom   lower  to  higher and  higher states oI
comple[ity, diIIerentiation  and organization. A virXs is an e[tremely simple
organism, little more than a molecXle. A bacteriXm is more comple[, more
diIIerentiated, possessing a cell wall and diIIerent types oI molecXles and a
metabolism. A parameciXm has a nXcleXs, cilia, and a rXdimentary digestive
system. A sponge not only  has cells bXt begins to have diIIerent types oI
cells interdependent Xpon each other. Insects and Iish have nervoXs systems
with comple[  methods oI  locomotion, and even social organizations. And
so it goes, Xp the scale oI evolXtion, a scale oI increasing comple[ity  and
organization and diIIerentiation,   with  man,  who  possesses an enormoXs
cerebral corte[ and e[traordinarily  comple[  behavior patterns, being, as Iar
as we can tell, at the top. I state that the process oI evolXtion is a miracle,
becaXse insoIar   as  it   is   a   process  oI   increasing  organization   and
diIIerentiation,  it  rXns coXnter to  natXral law.  In  the ordinary  coXrse oI
things, we who write and read this booN shoXld not e[ist.*
         *  The concept that evolution  runs counter  to natural  law is neither
new nor  original.  I  seem to remember someone I  studied in  my college
days stating, “Evolution is an eddy in the  second law of thermodynamics “
but I   have unfortunately  not  been able to  locate  the reference. •  More
recently the  concept has  been articulated by  Buckminster  Fuller   in  his
book And It Came to Pass—Not to 6tay (New York: Macmillan. 1976).

         The process oI evolXtion can be diagrammed by a pyramid, with man,
the most comple[ bXt least nXmeroXs organism, at the ape[, and virXses, the
most nXmeroXs bXt least comple[ organisms, at the base:

212
         The ape[  is thrXsting oXt, Xp, Iorward  against the Iorce oI  entropy,
Inside the  pyramid  I  have placed  an arrow,  to  symbolize this  thrXsting
evolXtionary  Iorce,   this    “something”   that   has   so   sXccessIXlly and
consistently deIied “natXral law” over millions Xpon millions oI generations
and that mXst itselI represent natXral law as yet XndeIined.
         The spiritXal evolXtion oI hXmanity can be similarly diagrammed:

213
         Again  and  again I   have emphasized that  the process oI   spiritXal
growth is  an eIIortIXl   and diIIicXlt  one.  This  is becaXse it is  condXcted
against a natXral resistance, against a natXral inclination to Neep things the
way they were, to  cling to  the old maps and old ways  oI doing  things, to
taNe the easy path. AboXt this natXral resistance, this Iorce oI entropy as it
operates in oXr spiritXal lives, I will have still more to say shortly. BXt as in
the  case oI   physical  evolXtion,  the  miracle   is  that  this   resistance is
overcome. :e  do  grow. Despite all that resists the process, we do become
better hXman beings. Not all oI Xs. Not  easily. BXt in signiIicant  nXmbers
hXmans somehow manage to improve themselves and their cXltXres There
is  a Iorce   that somehow  pXshes Xs to  choose the  more  diIIicXlt   path
whereby we can transcend the mire and mXcN into which we are so oIten
born.
         This diagram  oI the  process oI spiritXal evolXtion  can apply to  the
e[istence oI a single individXal. Each oI Xs has his or her own Xrge to grow,
and each oI Xs, in e[ercising  that Xrge mXst single-handedly Iight against
his or her own resistance. The diagram also applies to hXmanity as a whole.
As we  evolve as individXals,  so do we  caXse oXr society to evolve. The

214
cXltXre that  nXrtXres Xs in  childhood  is  nXrtXred by  oXr  leadership in
adXlthood. Those who achieve growth not only enMoy the IrXits oI growth
bXt give the  same IrXits to  the world.  Evolving  as individXals,  we carry
hXmanity on oXr bacNs. And so hXmanity evolves.
         The notion that the plane oI  manNind’s spiritXal development is in a
process oI ascension may hardly seem realistic to a generation disillXsioned
with the  dream oI progress. Everywhere is war,  corrXption and pollXtion.
How  coXld  one  reasonably sXggest that  the  hXman race  is  spiritXally
progressing? Yet  that  is   e[actly   what   I  sXggest. OXr   very  sense oI
disillXsionment arises Irom the Iact that we e[pect  more oI oXrselves than
oXr Iorebears did oI  themselves. HXman behavior that we Iind  repXgnant
and oXtrageoXs today was accepted as a matter oI  coXrse yesteryear. A
maMor IocXs oI this booN, Ior instance, has been on the responsibilities oI
parenthood Ior the  spiritXal nXrtXre oI  children.  This  is hardly  a radical
theme today, bXt several centXries ago it was generally not even a hXman
concern. :hile   I  Iind  the average TXality oI present parenting appallingly
poor, I  have every reason to believe  it  Iar sXperior to  that oI  MXst a Iew
generations bacN. A recent review oI  an  aspect oI child  care begins, Ior
instance, by noting:

                Roman  law gave the  Iather absolXte control over  his children,
       whom he coXld sell or  condemn to death with impXnity. This concept
       oI  absolXte right carried over into English law, where it prevailed Xntil
       the IoXrteenth centXry withoXt appreciable change. In the Middle Ages
       childhood was not seen as the XniTXe phase oI liIe we now consider it
       to be. It was cXstomary to send children as yoXng as seven into service
       or  apprenticeship, where learning was secondary to the labor a child
       perIormed Ior  his or  her master. The child and  the servant appear to
       have been indistingXishable in terms oI  how  they were treated; even
       the  langXage oIten Iailed to  Xse separate terms Ior each. It  was not
       Xntil the si[teenth centXry that children began to be looNed on as being
       oI  particXlar  interest, having  important  and  speciIic  developmental
       tasNs to perIorm, and being worthy oI aIIection. *

215
         BXt what. is  this Iorce that pXshes Xs as individXals and as a whole
species to grow against the natXral resistance oI oXr own lethargy? :e have
already labeled it. It is love. Love  was deIined as “the will  to e[tend  one’s
selI Ior the pXrpose oI nXrtXring. one’s own or another’s spiritXal growth.”
:hen   we grow, it is becaXse we are worNing at it, and we are worNing at it
becaXse we love oXrselves. It is throXgh love that we elevate oXrselves. And
it is throXgh oXr love Ior others that we assist others to elevate themselves.
Love, the e[tension oI the selI, is the very act oI evolXtion. It is evolXtion in
progress. The evolXtionary Iorce, present in all  oI  liIe,  maniIests itselI in
manNind as hXman love. Among hXmanity love is the miracXloXs Iorce that
deIies the natXral law oI entropy.

         The  Alpha    and   Omega


         :e   are still  leIt,  however, with  the TXestion asNed at the end oI the
section on love: :here   does love come Irom? Only now it can be enlarged
to a perhaps even more basic TXestion: :hence comes the whole Iorce  oI
evolXtion? And  to this  we  can add oXr pXzzlement aboXt the origins  oI
grace. For love is conscioXs, bXt grace is not. :hence comes this “powerIXl
Iorce  originating   oXtside oI   hXman conscioXsness which  nXrtXres the
spiritXal growth oI hXman beings”?
         :e   cannot answer these TXestions in the same scientiIic way we can
answer where IloXr or steel or maggots come Irom. It is not simply that they
are too intangible, bXt more that they are too basic Ior  oXr “science” as it
cXrrently e[ists.  For  these are not  the only  basic  TXestions that science
cannot answer. Do  we really  Nnow what  electricity  is,  Ior  instance? Or
where energy comes  Irom  in  the Iirst   place? Or  the  Xniverse? Perhaps
someday oXr  science  oI  answers  will   catch  Xp  with   the  most  basic
TXestions. Until then, iI   ever, we can only  specXlate, theorize, postXlate,
hypothesize.
         To e[plain   the miracles oI  grace and evolXtion we  hypothesize the
e[istence oI a God who  wants Xs to grow—a God who loves Xs. To many
this hypothesis seems too simple, too easy; too mXch liNe Iantasy; childliNe
and naive. BXt what else do we have? To ignore the data by  Xsing tXnnel

216
vision is  not  an answer. :e    cannot obtain an  answer by  not asNing the
TXestions. Simple thoXgh it may be, no one who has observed the data and
asNed the TXestions has been able to prodXce a better hypothesis or even
really  a hypothesis  at all.   Until  someone does, we  are  stXcN with  this
strangely childliNe notion oI a loving God or else with a theoretical vacXXm.
         And  iI  we  taNe it serioXsly, we  are going  to  Iind  that this  simple
notion oI a loving God does not maNe Ior an easy philosophy.
         II we postXlate that oXr capacity to love, this Xrge to grow and evolve,
is somehow “breathed into” Xs by God, then we mXst asN to what end. :hy
does God want Xs to grow? :hat are we growing toward? :here   is the end
point, the goal oI evolXtion? :hat    is it  that God wants oI Xs? It is not my
intention here to  become involved in  theological niceties,  and I hope the
scholarly will Iorgive  me iI I cXt throXgh all the iIs, ands, and bXts oI proper
specXlative theology. For no matter how  mXch we may  liNe to pXssyIoot
aroXnd it, all  oI  Xs who postXlate a loving  God and really  thinN aboXt it
eventXally come  to  a  single  terriIying  idea:  God  wants  Xs to  become
HimselI (or HerselI  or ItselI). :e    are growing toward godhood. God is the
goal oI evolXtion. It is God who is the soXrce oI the evolXtionary Iorce and
God who is the destination. That is what we mean when we say that He is
the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
         :hen   I .said that this is a terriIying idea I was speaNing mildly. It is a
very old idea, bXt, by the millions, we rXn away Irom it  in sheer panic. For
no idea ever came to the mind oI man which places Xpon Xs sXch a bXrden.
It is the single most demanding idea in the history oI manNind. Not becaXse
it is diIIicXlt  to conceive; to the contrary, it is the essence oI simplicity. BXt
becaXse iI we believe it, it then demands Irom Xs all that we  can possibly
give, all that we have. It is one thing to  believe in a nice old God who will
taNe good care oI Xs Irom  a loIty  position  oI power  which  we oXrselves
coXld never begin to attain. It is TXite another to believe in a God who has it
in mind Ior  Xs precisely that we shoXld attain His position, His power, His
wisdom, His  identity. :ere    we to  believe it  possible Ior  man to  become
God this  belieI by  its  very  natXre woXld place Xpon Xs an obligation  to
attempt to attain the possible. BXt we do not want this obligation. :e  don’t
want to have to  worN that hard.  :e   don’t  want God’s  responsibility:  :e
don’t want the responsibility oI  having to thinN all the time. As long  as we
can believe that  godhood is  an  impossible attainment Ior  oXrselves, we

217
don’t  have to  worry  aboXt oXr spiritXal  growth,  we  don’t  have to  pXsh
oXrselves to higher and higher levels oI conscioXsness and loving activity;
we can rela[  and MXst be hXman. II God’s in his heaven and we’re down
here, and  never  the  twain   shall  meet,  we  can  let  Him   have  all  the
responsibility Ior evolXtion and the directorship oI the Xniverse. :e  can do
oXr bit toward assXring oXrselves a comIortable old age, hopeIXlly complete
with  healthy, happy and grateIXl children  and grandchildren;  bXt beyond
that we  need not  bother  oXrselves. These goals are diIIicXlt   enoXgh to
achieve, and hardly to be disparaged. Nonetheless, as soon as we believe it
is possible Ior man to become God, we can really never rest Ior long, never
say, “OK, my  Mob is Iinished, my worN is done.” :e  mXst constantly pXsh
oXrselves to greater and greater wisdom, greater and greater eIIectiveness.
By this  belieI  we will   have trapped oXrselves, at least Xntil death, on an
eIIortIXl   treadmill   oI   selI-improvement   and   spiritXal   growth.   God’s
responsibility  mXst be  oXr own.  It  is  no  wonder  that the  belieI  in  the
possibility oI Godhead is repXgnant.
         The idea that God is actively nXrtXring Xs so that we might grow Xp to
be liNe Him brings Xs Iace to Iace with oXr own laziness.

         Entropy    and   Original      Sin


         Being aboXt spiritXal growth, this  booN is inevitably aboXt the other
side oI the same coin: the impediments to spiritXal growth. Ultimately there
is only the one impediment, and that is  laziness. II we overcome laziness,
all  the  other  impediments  will   be  overcome. II   we  do  not  overcome
laziness, none oI the others will  be  hXrdled. So this is also  a booN aboXt
laziness. In  e[amining   discipline   we  were  considering the  laziness  oI
attempting to  avoid  necessary sXIIering, or taNing the  easy way  oXt. In
e[amining  love   we  were  also e[amining   the  Iact  that  nonlove  is   the
Xnwillingness to  e[tend  one’s selI.  Laziness is love’s  opposite. SpiritXal
growth is eIIortIXl, as we have been reminded again and again. :e are now
at  a  position  Irom   which  we   can e[amine   the  natXre oI   laziness  in
perspective and realize that laziness is the Iorce oI entropy as it maniIests
itselI in the lives oI all oI Xs.

218
         For many years I IoXnd the notion  oI original  sin meaningless, even
obMectionable. Se[Xality did not striNe me as particXlarly  sinIXl. Nor  my
varioXs other   appetites. I   woXld   TXite  IreTXently  indXlge  myselI  by
overeating an e[cellent meal, and while I might sXIIer pangs oI indigestion,
I certainly  did not  sXIIer any pangs oI gXilt. I  perceived sin in  the world:
cheating, preMXdice, tortXre, brXtality. BXt I Iailed to perceive any inherent
sinIXlness in  inIants, nor  coXld  I  Iind  it   rational to  believe  that  yoXng
children were cXrsed becaXse their ancestors had eaten Irom the IrXit oI the
tree oI  the  Nnowledge oI good  and evil.   GradXally, however, I  became
increasingly aware oI the XbiTXitoXs natXre oI laziness. In the strXggle to
help my patients grow,  I IoXnd that  my chieI  enemy was invariably  their
laziness. And I  became aware in myselI oI  a similar  relXctance to e[tend
myselI to new areas oI thoXght, responsibility and matXration. One thing I
clearly had in  common with  all  manNind was my laziness. It  was at  this
point that the serpent-and-the-apple story sXddenly made sense.
         The Ney issXe lies in what is missing. The story sXggests that God was
in the habit oI “walNing in  the garden in the cool oI the day” and that there
were open channels oI commXnication between Him and man. BXt iI  this
was so, then why was it that Adam and Eve, separately or together, beIore
or aIter the serpent’s Xrging, did not say to God, “:e’re   cXrioXs as to why
YoX don’t want Xs to  eat any oI the IrXit  oI  the tree oI  the Nnowledge oI
good and evil. :e  really  liNe it here, and we don’t want to seem XngrateIXl,
bXt YoXr law on this matter doesn’t maNe mXch sense to Xs, and we’d really
appreciate it iI yoX e[plained it  to Xs”? BXt oI coXrse they did not say this.
Instead they went ahead and broNe God’s law withoXt ever Xnderstanding
the reason behind  the  law,  withoXt  taNing the  eIIort  to  challenge God
directly,  TXestion his  aXthority  or  even’  commXnicate with   Him   on  a
reasonably adXlt level. They listened to the serpent, bXt they Iailed  to get
God’s side oI the story beIore they acted.
         :hy    this IailXre? :hy   was no step taNen between the temptation and
the action? It is this missing step that is the essence oI sin. The step missing
is the step oI debate. Adam and Eve coXld have set Xp a debate between the
serpent and God, bXt in Iailing to do so they Iailed to  obtain God’s side oI
the TXestion. The debate between the serpent and God is symbolic oI the
dialogXe between good and evil  which  can and  shoXld occXr within  the
minds oI  hXman beings. OXr IailXre to condXct—or to  condXct IXlly  and

219
wholeheartedly—this internal debate between good and evil is the caXse oI
those evil actions that constitXte sin. In debating the wisdom oI a proposed
coXrse oI action, hXman beings roXtinely Iail  to  obtain God’s side oI  the
issXe. They Iail to consXlt or listen to the God within  them, the Nnowledge
oI rightness which inherently resides within  the minds oI all  manNind. :e
maNe this IailXre becaXse we are lazy.  It  is worN  to  hold these internal
debates. They reTXire time and energy MXst to condXct them. And iI we taNe
them serioXsly—iI we serioXsly listen to this “God within  Xs”—we XsXally
Iind oXrselves. being Xrged to taNe the more diIIicXlt path, the path oI more
eIIort  rather  than less.  To  condXct the  debate is  to  open  oXrselves to
sXIIering and strXggle. Each and every one oI Xs, more or less IreTXently,
will  hold bacN Irom this worN, will also seeN to avoid this painIXl step. LiNe
Adam and Eve, and every one oI oXr ancestors beIore Xs, we are all lazy.
         So original sin does e[ist; it  is oXr laziness. It is very real. It e[ists in
each and every one oI Xs—inIants, children, adolescents, matXre adXlts, the
elderly; the wise or the stXpid; the lame or  the whole. Some oI Xs may be
less lazy than others, bXt we are all  lazy  to some e[tent.  No  matter how
energetic, ambitioXs or even wise we may be, iI we trXly looN into oXrselves
we will  Iind laziness lXrNing at some level. It is the Iorce oI entropy within
Xs, pXshing Xs down and holding Xs all bacN Irom oXr spiritXal evolXtion.
         Some readers may say to themselves, “BXt I’m not lazy. I worN si[ty
hoXrs a weeN at my Mob. In the evenings and on the weeNends, even thoXgh
I’m tired, I  e[tend myselI to go oXt with my spoXse, taNe the children to the
zoo, help  with  the  hoXseworN, do any nXmber oI  chores. Sometimes it
seems that’s all  I  do—worN, worN, worN.”  I  can  sympathize with  these
readers bXt can persist only  in  pointing  oXt  that they  will   Iind  laziness
within  themselves iI they  looN Ior it.  For  laziness taNes Iorms other than
that related to the bare nXmber oI hoXrs spent on the Mob or devoted to one’s
responsibilities to  ‘others. A  maMor Iorm that  laziness taNes is Iear. The
myth oI Adam and Eve can again be Xsed to illXstrate this. One might say,
Ior instance, that  it was  not laziness that prevented Adam  and Eve Irom
TXestioning God as to the reasons behind His law bXt Iear—Iear in the Iace
oI the awesomeness oI God, Iear oI the wrath oI God. BXt while all Iear is
not laziness, mXch Iear is e[actly that. MXch oI oXr Iear is Iear oI a change
in the statXs TXo, a Iear that we might lose what we have iI we ventXre Iorth
Irom where we are now. In the section on discipline I spoNe oI the Iact that

220
people  Iind   new   inIormation   distinctly   threatening,   becaXse iI   they
incorporate it they will  have to do a good deal oI worN to revise their maps
oI reality,  and they  instinctively   seeN to avoid that  worN. ConseTXently,
more oIten than not they will  Iight against the new inIormation  rather than
Ior its assimilation. Their  resistance is motivated by Iear, yes, bXt the basis
oI their  Iear is laziness; it  is the Iear  oI the worN they  woXld have to do.
Similarly, in the section on love I  spoNe oI the risNs oI e[tending oXrselves
into new territory, new commitments and responsibilities, new relationships
and levels oI e[istence. Here again the risN is oI the loss oI the statXs TXo,
and the Iear is oI the worN involved in arriving at a new statXs TXo. So it is
TXite probable that Adam  and Eve were aIraid  oI  what might  happen to
them iI  they were to openly  TXestion God; instead they attempted to taNe
the  easy way   oXt, the   illegitimate  shortcXt  oI   sneaNiness, to achieve
Nnowledge not worNed Ior, and hope they coXld get away with it. BXt they
did not. To TXestion God may let Xs in Ior a lot oI worN. BXt a moral oI the
story is that it mXst be done.
         Psychotherapists Nnow that althoXgh  patients come  to  Xs seeNing
change oI one Nind or another, they are actXally terriIied oI change—oI the
worN oI change. It is becaXse oI this terror or laziness that the vast maMority
oI   patients—perhaps  nine   oXt  oI    ten—who   begin   the   process  oI
psychotherapy, drop  oXt oI   therapy  long  beIore  the  process has  been
completed. The maMority oI these drop-oXts (or cop-oXts) occXr dXring the
Iirst Iew sessions or Iirst Iew months oI  treatment. The dynamics are oIten
clearest in the cases oI those married patients who become aware dXring the
Iirst Iew  sessions oI therapy that their marriages are dreadIXlly disordered
or destrXctive, and  hence that  the path  to  mental  health will   lie  either
throXgh divorce or else throXgh an enormoXsly diIIicXlt and painIXl process
oI completely restrXctXring a marriage. ActXally, these patients oIten have
this awareness sXbliminally beIore they even seeN psychotherapy, and the
Iirst Iew sessions oI therapy only serve to conIirm what they already Nnew
and dreaded. In any case, they become overwhelmed by Iear oI Iacing the
seemingly impossible  diIIicXlties   oI  living   alone  or  apparently eTXally
impossible diIIicXlties  oI  worNing Ior  months and years with  their  mates
toward radically improved relationships. So they stop treatment, sometimes
aIter two or  three sessions, sometimes aIter ten or twenty. They may stop
with  some sXch e[cXse as “:e’ve    decided we made a mistaNe when we

221
thoXght we had the money Ior treatment” or they may stop honestly with an
open acNnowledgment: “I’m    aIraid  oI   what  therapy  might  do   to  my
marriage. I Nnow it’s a cop-oXt. Maybe someday I’ll have the gXts to come
bacN.” At any rate, they settle Ior the maintenance oI a miserable statXs TXo
in  preIerence to  the  tremendoXs amoXnt oI  eIIort  they  realize  will   be
reTXired to worN their way oXt oI their particXlar traps.
         In  the  earlier   stages oI  spiritXal   growth,  individXals  are  mostly
Xnaware oI their  own laziness, althoXgh they  may give  it  lip  service by
saying sXch things  as “OI  coXrse, liNe  everybody else, I  have  my  lazy
moments.” This is becaXse the lazy part oI the selI, liNe the devil that it may
actXally be,  is  XnscrXpXloXs and specializes in  treacheroXs disgXise. It
cloaNs its own laziness in  all manner oI  rationalizations, which  the more
growing part oI the selI is still  too weaN to see throXgh easily or to combat.
ThXs a person will   say to  the sXggestion that he or  she gain some new
Nnowledge in a certain area, “That area’s been stXdied by a lot  oI people
and they’ve not come Xp with any answers” or “I Nnow a man who was into
that stXII and he was an alcoholic who committed sXicide” or “I’m too old a
dog to learn new tricNs” or “YoX’re trying to  manipXlate me into becoming
a carbon copy oI yoXrselI and that’s not what psychotherapists are sXpposed
to do.” All  oI  these responses and many more are cover-Xps oI patients’ or
stXdents’ laziness, designed to disgXise it not so mXch Irom the therapist or
teacher as Irom themselves. For to  recognize’ laziness Ior  what it  is and
acNnowledge it in oneselI is the beginning oI its cXrtailment.
         For  these reasons, those who are in  the  relatively  more  advanced
stages oI  spiritXal growth   are the  very  ones most  aware  oI  their  own
laziness. It is  the least lazy  who Nnow themselves to be slXggish. In  my
personal strXggle Ior matXrity I am gradXally becoming more aware oI new’
insights, which tend, as iI oI themselves, to want to slip away Irom me. Or I
glimpse  new,  constrXctive  avenXes  oI   thoXght  on  which   my   steps;
seemingly oI their own accord, start to drag. I sXspect that most oI the time
these valXable thoXghts do slip  away Xnnoticed and that  I  wander Irom
these valXable avenXes withoXt Nnowing what I’m doing.  BXt when I  do
become conscioXs oI the Iact that I am dragging my Ieet, I am compelled to
e[ert the will  to  TXicNen my pace in the very direction I am avoiding. The
Iight against entropy never ends.

222
         :e   all have a sicN selI and a healthy selI. No matter how neXrotic or
even psychotic  we  may be,  even iI   we  seem to  be totally   IearIXl  and
completely rigid, there is still  a part oI Xs, however small, that wants Xs to
grow, that liNes change and development, that is attracted to the new and the
XnNnown, and that is willing to do the worN and taNe the risNs involved in
spiritXal evolXtion. And  no matter  how seemingly healthy  and spiritXally
evolved we are, there is still a part oI Xs, however small, that does not want
Xs to e[ert  oXrselves, that clings  to  the old  and  Iamiliar,  IearIXl oI  any
change or eIIort, desiring comIort  at any cost and ‘absence oI pain at any
price, even iI  the  penalty be ineIIectiveness, stagnation or  regression. In
some oI Xs oXr healthy selI seems pathetically small, wholly dominated by
the laziness and IearIXlness oI oXr monXmental sicN selI. Others oI Xs may
be rapidly growing,  oXr dominant healthy selI reaching eagerly Xpward in
the strXggle to  evolve toward  godhood; the  healthy selI,  however, mXst
always be vigilant against the laziness oI the sicN selI that still lXrNs within
Xs. In this  one respect we  hXman beings are all  eTXal. :ithin    each and
every one oI Xs there are two selves, one sicN and one healthy—the liIe Xrge
and the death Xrge, iI yoX will. Each oI Xs represents the whole hXman race;
within each oI Xs is the instinct Ior godhood and the hope Ior manNind, and
within  each oI Xs is the original  sin  oI laziness, the ever-present Iorce oI
entropy pXshing Xs bacN to childhood, to the womb and to the swamps Irom
which we have evolved.

         The  Problem     of  EYil


         Having sXggested that laziness is original sin and that laziness in the
Iorm oI oXr sicN selI might even be the devil, it is relevant to roXnd oXt the
pictXre by maNing some remarNs aboXt the natXre oI evil The problem oI
evil  is perhaps the greatest oI  ‘all  theological  problems. Yet,  as with  so
many other “religioXs”  issXes, the science oI psychology has acted, with a
Iew  minor   e[ceptions,  as  iI   evil   did  not   e[ist.   Potentially,  however,
psychology has mXch to contribXte to the sXbMect. I hope that I will be able
to maNe part oI sXch a contribXtion in a later worN oI some length. For the
moment, since it is  only peripheral to  the theme oI this  booN, I will  limit

223
myselI to  brieIly  stating  IoXr conclXsions I  have reached concerning the
natXre oI evil.
         First, I have come to conclXde that evil is real. It is not the Iigment oI
the imagination oI a  primitive  religioXs mind Ieebly  attempting to e[plain
the XnNnown. There really are people, and institXtions made Xp oI people,
who respond with hatred in the presence oI goodness and woXld destroy the
good insoIar as it is in their power to do so. They do this not with conscioXs
malice bXt blindly, lacNing awareness oI their own evil—indeed, seeNing to
avoid any sXch awareness. As has been described oI the devil in religioXs
literatXre, they hate the light and instinctively  will  do anything to avoid  it,
inclXding attempting to  e[tingXish  it.  They will   destroy the light  in  their
own children and in all other beings sXbMect to their power.
         Evil people hate the light becaXse it reveals themselves to themselves.
They hate goodness becaXse it reveals their badness; they hate love becaXse
it reveals their laziness. They will  destroy the light, the goodness, the love
in order to  avoid the pain  oI sXch selI-awareness. My second conclXsion,
then, is that evil is laziness carried to its Xltimate, e[traordinary e[treme. As
I have deIined it,  love  is the antithesis oI  laziness. Ordinary laziness is a
passive IailXre to love. Some ordinarily lazy people may not liIt a Iinger  to
e[tend  themselves Xnless they are compelled to  do so.  Their being  is  a
maniIestation oI nonlove; still,  they are not evil.  TrXly  evil people, on the
other hand, actively rather than passively avoid e[tending themselves. They
will  taNe any action in their power to protect their own laziness, to preserve
the integrity   oI  their  sicN selI.  Rather  than  nXrtXring others, they  will
actXally destroy others in  this  caXse. II necessary, they will  even  Nill to
escape the pain oI their own spiritXal growth. As the integrity  oI their sicN
selI is threatened by the spiritXal health oI those aroXnd them, they will seeN
by all manner oI means to crXsh and demolish the spiritXal health that may
e[ist near them. I deIine evil,  then, as the e[ercise oI political power—that
is, the imposition oI one’s will  Xpon others by overt or covert coercion—in
order to avoid  e[tending  one’s selI  Ior the  pXrpose oI nXrtXring spiritXal
growth. Ordinary laziness is nonlove; evil is antilove.
         My third  conclXsion is that the e[istence oI evil is  inevitable, at least
at this stage in hXman evolXtion. Given the Iorce oI entropy and the Iact that
hXmans possess Iree will, it is inevitable that laziness will be well contained
in some  and completely  Xncontained in others. As  entropy, on  the  one·

224
hand, and the evolXtionary Ilow oI love, on the other, are opposing Iorces, it
is only natXral that these Iorces will be relatively in balance in most people,
while a Iew at one e[treme will  maniIest almost pXre love, and a Iew at the
other e[treme pXre entropy or  evil. Since they  are conIlicting  Iorces, it is
also inevitable that those at the e[tremes will  be locNed in combat; it is as
natXral Ior evil to hate goodness as it is Ior goodness to hate evil.
         Last, I  have  come to  conclXde that while  entropy  is  an enormoXs
Iorce, in its most e[treme Iorm oI  hXman evil it is strangely ineIIective as a
social Iorce. I myselI have witnessed evil in action, vicioXsly attacNing and
eIIectively destroying the spirits and minds oI  dozens oI children. BXt evil
bacNIires in the big pictXre oI hXman evolXtion. For every soXl it destroys—
and  there  are  many—it    is  instrXmental  in   the   salvation  oI   others.
Unwittingly,  evil  serves as a  beacon to warn  others away  Irom  its  own
shoals. BecaXse most oI Xs have been graced by an almost instinctive sense
oI horror at the oXtrageoXsness oI evil, when we recognize its presence, oXr
own  personalities  ·are honed  by   the  awareness oI  its  e[istence.   OXr
conscioXsness oI it is a signal to pXriIy oXrselves. It was evil, Ior instance,
that raised Christ to the cross, thereby enabling Xs to see him Irom aIar. OXr
personal involvement in  the Iight  against evil  in  the world  is  one oI  the
ways we grow.

         The  EYolution     of   Consciousness


         The  words “aware”   and “awareness”  have repeatedly cropped  Xp
throXghoXt. Evil people resist the awareness oI their own condition. A marN
oI the spiritXally advanced is their awareness oI their own laziness. People
oIten are not aware oI their own religion or world view, and in the coXrse oI
their religioXs growth it is necessary Ior them to become aware oI their own
assXmptions and tendencies  toward  bias.  ThroXgh  bracNeting and  the
attention oI love we grow more aware oI oXr beloved and oI the world. An
essential part oI   discipline  is  the development  oI  an  awareness oI oXr
responsibility and power oI choice. The capacity oI awareness we assign to
that portion oI the mind we call conscioXs or conscioXsness. :e are now at
the point where we can deIine spiritXal growth as the growth or evolXtion oI
conscioXsness.

225
         The word “conscioXs” is derived Irom  the Latin  preIi[  con, meaning
“with,”  and the word scire, meaning “to Nnow.” To be conscioXs means “to
Nnow with.”  BXt  how  are we  to Xnderstand this “with”?   To  Nnow with
Zhat? :e   have spoNen oI the Iact that the XnconscioXs part oI oXr mind is
the possessor ·oI e[traordinary Nnowledge. It Nnows more than we Nnow,
“we” being deIined as oXr conscioXs selI. And when we become aware oI a
new trXth, it is becaXse we recognize it to be trXe; we re-Nnow that which
we Nnew  all  along.  ThereIore, might  we  not  conclXde that  to  become
conscioXs is   to   Nnow  Zith    oXr   XnconscioXs? The  development   oI
conscioXsness is the development oI awareness in oXr conscioXs mind oI
Nnowledge along Zith oXr XnconscioXs mind, which already possesses that
Nnowledge. It is a  process oI the conscioXs mind coming  into synchrony
with    the    XnconscioXs.  This    shoXld   be   no    strange   concept    to
psychotherapists, who  IreTXently deIine   their  therapy  as a  process  oI
“maNing   the   XnconscioXs  conscioXs”   or    enlarging   the    realm   oI
conscioXsness in relation to the realm oI XnconscioXsness.
         BXt  we  still   have not   e[plained  how  it   is  that  the  XnconscioXs
possesses all this Nnowledge which we have not yet  conscioXsly learned.
Here again the TXestion is so basic that we have no scientiIic answer. Again
we can only hypothesize. And again I Nnow oI no hypothesis as satisIactory
as the  postXlation oI  a  God  who  is  intimately   associated with  Xs—so
intimately that  He is part  oI Xs. II  yoX want to  Nnow the closest place to
looN Ior grace, it is within yoXrselI. II  yoX desire wisdom greater than yoXr
own, yoX can Iind   it inside  yoX. :hat    this  sXggests is that the interIace
between God  and  man  is   at  least  in  part  the  interIace  between  oXr
XnconscioXs and oXr conscioXs. To pXt it plainly, oXr XnconscioXs is God.
God within Xs. :e   were part oI God all  the time. God has been with Xs all
along, is now, and always will be. How can this be? II the reader is horriIied
by the notion that oXr XnconscioXs is God, he or she shoXld recall that it is
hardly  a heretical  concept, being  in  essence the same as  the Christian
concept oI the Holy  Ghost or Holy  Spirit  which resides in Xs all. I  Iind  it
most helpIXl to Xnderstand this relationship between God and oXrselves by
thinNing oI  oXr  XnconscioXs as a rhizome, or  incredibly   large and  rich
hidden  root  system,  which  noXrishes the   tiny  plant   oI  conscioXsness
sproXting visibly  Irom  it.  I  am indebted  .Ior  this analogy  to JXng, who,
describing himselI as “a splinter oI the inIinite deity,” went on to say:

226
         LiIe has always seemed to me liNe a plant that lives on its rhizome. Its
trXe liIe  is invisible,  hidden in  the  rhizome. The part  that appears above
groXnd lasts only a  single sXmmer. Then it  withers away—an ephemeral
apparition. :hen   we  thinN oI  the Xnending growth and decay oI  liIe  and
civilization,  we cannot escape the impression oI absolXte nXllity. Yet I have
never lost  a  sense oI  something that  lives  and endXres Xnderneath the
eternal IlX[.   :hat    we  see is  the  blossom,  which  passes. The rhizome
remains. *
         *  C. G.  Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, Aniela Jaffe, ed. (New
York: Vintage Books, 1965), p. 4.

         JXng never went TXite so Iar as to actXally state that God e[isted in
the XnconscioXs, althoXgh his writings  clearly  pointed  in  that  direction.
:hat   he  did do  was to divide  the XnconscioXs into the more sXperIicial,
individXal “personal XnconscioXs” and the deeper “collective XnconscioXs”
that is common to manNind. In my vision the collective XnconscioXs is God;
the conscioXs is man as  individXal;  and the personal XnconscioXs is the
interIace between  them.  Being  this   interIace, it   is  inevitable   that  the
personal XnconscioXs shoXld be a place oI some tXrmoil, the scene oI some
strXggle between God’s will and the will oI the individXal. I have previoXsly
described the XnconscioXs as a benign and loving realm. This I believe it to
be. BXt  dreams, thoXgh they  contain  messages oI loving  wisdom,  also
contain many signs oI conIlict; while they may be pleasantly selI-renewing,
they may  also  be  tXmXltXoXs, Irightening  nightmares. BecaXse oI  this
tXmXltXoXsness, mental illness has been localized in the XnconscioXs by
most thinNers, as iI the XnconscioXs were the seat oI psychopathology and
symptoms were  liNe  sXbterranean demons that  sXrIace to   bedevil  the
individXal. As I  have already said, my own view  is the opposite. I believe
that the conscioXs is the seat oI psychopathology and that mental disorders
are disorders oI conscioXsness. It is becaXse oXr conscioXs selI resists oXr
XnconscioXs wisdom  that  we  become ill.    It  is   precisely  becaXse oXr
conscioXsness is  disordered  that  conIlict   occXrs  between  it   and  the
XnconscioXs which seeNs to heal it. In other words, mental illness  occXrs
when the conscioXs will  oI  the individXal  deviates sXbstantially Irom the
will oI  God, which is the individXal’s own XnconscioXs will.

227
         I  have  said that  the  Xltimate  goal  oI  spiritXal  growth  is  Ior   the
individXal to  become as one with God. It  is to Nnow with  God. Since the
XnconscioXs is God all along, we may  IXrther deIine the goal oI  spiritXal
growth to be the attainment oI godhood by the conscioXs selI. It is  Ior the
individXal to become totally,  wholly  God. Does this mean that the goal is
Ior   the   conscioXs to   merge   with   the   XnconscioXs, so   that   all   is
XnconscioXsness? Hardly. :e now come to the point oI it all. The point is to
become God while preserving conscioXsness. II the bXd oI conscioXsness
that grows  Irom  the rhizome  oI the  XnconscioXs God can become itselI
God, then God will  have assXmed a new liIe Iorm. This is the meaning oI
oXr individXal e[istence. :e  are born that we might become, as a conscioXs
individXal, a new liIe Iorm oI God.
         The  conscioXs is the  e[ecXtive  part  oI  oXr  total  being.  It  is  the
conscioXs that maNes decisions and translates them into action. :ere we to
become all XnconscioXs, we woXld be indeed liNe the new born inIant, one
with God bXt incapable oI any action that might maNe the presence oI God
Ielt in  the world. As  I have mentioned, there is a regressive TXality to the
mystical thoXght oI some HindX or BXddhist theology, in which  the statXs
oI the inIant withoXt ego boXndaries is compared to Nirvana and the goal oI
entering Nirvana seems similar to the goal oI  retXrning to the womb.  The
goal oI  theology presented here, and that oI  most mystics, is  e[actly  the
opposite. It is not  to become an egoless, XnconscioXs babe. Rather it is to
develop a matXre, conscioXs ego which then can become the ego oI God. II
as adXlts, walNing aroXnd on  two  legs,  capable oI  maNing independent
choices that inIlXence the world, we can identiIy oXr matXre Iree will  with
that oI God, then God will  have assXmed throXgh oXr conscioXs ego a new
and potent liIe  Iorm.  :e    will   have become God’s agent, his  arm, so  to
speaN, and thereIore part oI Him. And insoIar as we might then throXgh oXr
conscioXs decisions be able to inIlXence the world according to His will oXr
lives themselves will become the agents oI God’s grace. :e  oXrselves will
then have become one Iorm oI  the grace oI  God, worNing on  His behalI
among manNind, creating love where love did not e[ist beIore, pXlling oXr
Iellow  creatXres Xp to oXr own level  oI  awareness, pXshing the plane oI
hXman evolXtion Iorward.

         The  Nature    of  PoZer


         :e   have now come to the point where we can Xnderstand the natXre
oI  power.  It   is   a  mXch  misXnderstood  sXbMect. One reason Ior   the
misXnderstanding is  that  there are  two   Ninds oI   power—political   and
spiritXal. ReligioXs mythology taNes pains to draw the distinction between
the two. Prior to the birth oI BXddha, Ior instance, the soothsayers inIormed
his Iather that BXddha woXld grow Xp to become the most powerIXl Ning in
the land or else a poor man who woXld be the greatest spiritXal leader the
world had ever Nnown. Either or, bXt not both. And  Christ was oIIered by
Satan “all  the  Ningdoms oI  the  world  and  the glory   oI  them.”  BXt  he
reMected this alternative in Iavor oI  dying,  seemingly impotent, Xpon the
cross.
         Political power is the capacity to coerce others, overtly or covertly, to
do one’s will.   This  capacity resides in  a position,  sXch as a Ningship or
presidency, or else in money. It does not reside in the person who occXpies
the  position  or  possesses the money.  ConseTXently political   power  is
Xnrelated to goodness or wisdom. Very stXpid and  very evil  people have
walNed as Nings Xpon the earth. SpiritXal power, however, resides entirely
within  the individXal  and  has nothing to  do  with  the capacity  to coerce
others. People oI  great  spiritXal power  may  be wealthy  and  may  Xpon
occasion occXpy political positions oI leadership, bXt they are as liNely to be
poor  and lacNing  in  political   aXthority. Then,  what  is  the  capacity  oI
spiritXal power  iI  not the  capacity to  coerce? It  is the  capacity to  maNe
decisions with ma[imXm awareness. It is conscioXsness.
         Most people most oI the time maNe decisions with little awareness oI
what they are doing. They taNe action with little Xnderstanding oI their own
motives and withoXt beginning to Nnow the ramiIications  oI their choices.
Do we really Nnow what we are doing when we accept or reMect a potential
client?  :hen     we   hit  a   child,   promote  a   sXbordinate, Ilirt    with   an
acTXaintance? Anyone who has  worNed Ior  long  in   the political   arena
Nnows that actions taNen with the best intentions  will  oIten  bacNIire and
prove harmIXl  in  the  end;  or  that  people with  scXrriloXs  motives may
promote  a  seemingly   wicNed  caXse that  Xltimately   tXrns  oXt  to   be
constrXctive. So also in the area oI child-raising. Is  it any  better to do the

229
right thing Ior the wrong reasons than the wrong thing Ior the right reasons?
:e   are oIten most in the darN when we are the most certain, and the most
enlightened when we are the most conIXsed.
         :hat   are we  to do, adriIt  in  a sea oI ignorance? Some are nihilistic
and say, “Nothing.” They propose only that we shoXld continXe to driIt, as
iI no coXrse coXld possibly be charted in sXch a vast sea which woXld bring
Xs to any  trXe clarity  or  meaningIXl destination.  BXt others, sXIIiciently
aware to   Nnow that  they   are lost,   dare  to  hope  that  they  can  worN
themselves oXt oI ignorance throXgh developing  even greater awareness.
They are correct. It is possible. BXt sXch greater awareness does not come
to them in a single blinding  Ilash oI  enlightenment. It comes slowly, piece
by piece, and each piece mXst be worNed Ior by the patient eIIort oI stXdy
and observation  oI  everything,  inclXding  themselves. They  are hXmble
stXdents. The path oI spiritXal growth is a path oI liIelong learning.
         II  this  path  is  Iollowed  long  and  earnestly enoXgh, the pieces oI
Nnowledge begin to Iall into  place. GradXally things begin to maNe sense.
There are blind   alleys, disappointments, concepts arrived  at  only  to  be
discarded. BXt gradXally it is possible Ior Xs to come to a deeper and deeper
Xnderstanding oI what oXr  e[istence is  all  aboXt. And gradXally  we can
come to the place where we actXally Nnow what we are doing. :e can come
to power.
         The e[perience oI spiritXal power is basically a MoyIXl one. There is a
Moy that comes with mastery. Indeed, there is no greater satisIaction than
that oI being an e[pert,  oI  really Nnowing what we  are doing. Those who
have grown the most spiritXally are those who are the e[perts in living. And
there is yet another Moy, even greater. It is the Moy oI commXnion with God.
For when we  trXly  Nnow what we  are doing, we  are participating in  the
omniscience oI God. :ith    total  awareness oI the natXre oI a sitXation, oI
oXr motives Ior acting Xpon it,  and oI the resXlts and ramiIications oI  oXr
action, we have attained that level  oI  awareness that we normally e[pect
only oI  God. OXr conscioXs selI has sXcceeded in coming into alignment
with the mind oI God. :e   Nnow with God.
         Yet those who have attained this stage oI spiritXal growth, this state oI
great awareness, are invariably possessed by a MoyIXl hXmility. For one oI
their very awarenesses is the awareness that their XnXsXal wisdom has its
origin  in  their  XnconscioXs. They are  aware oI  their  connection  to  the

230
rhizome and aware that their  Nnowledge Ilows to them  Irom the  rhizome
throXgh the connection. Their eIIorts at learning are only eIIorts to open the
connection, and they are aware that the rhizome, their XnconscioXs, is not
theirs alone bXt all manNind’s, all liIe’s,  God’s. Invariably when asNed the
soXrce oI their Nnowledge and power, the trXly powerIXl will  reply:  “It  is
not my power. :hat   little  power I  have is bXt a minXte e[pression oI a Iar
greater power. I am merely a condXit. It is not my power at all.” I have said
that this hXmility  is  MoyIXl. That is becaXse, with their awareness oI their
connectedness to God, the trXly powerIXl e[perience a diminXtion in their
sense oI selI. “Let thy will,  not mine, be done. MaNe me yoXr instrXment,”
is their only desire. SXch a loss oI selI brings with it always a Nind oI calm
ecstasy, not XnliNe the e[perience oI being in love. Aware oI their intimate
connectedness to God, they e[perience a sXrcease oI loneliness. There is
commXnion.
         JoyIXl thoXgh it is, the e[perience oI spiritXal power is also terriIying.
For the greater one’s  awareness, the more diIIicXlt  it  is to  taNe action. I
mentioned this Iact at  the conclXsion oI the Iirst  section when I  gave the
analogy oI two  generals, each having to maNe the decision oI whether or
not to commit a division to battle. The one who regards his division simply
and solely  as a Xnit  oI  strategy may sleep easily  aIter  having made his
decision. BXt Ior the  other, with his  awareness oI each oI the lives oI  the
men Xnder  his  command,  the  decision will    be  agonizing.  :e    are  all
generals. :hatever  action we taNe may inIlXence the coXrse oI civilization.
The decision  whether to  praise or  pXnish a  single child  may  have vast
conseTXences. It is easy to act with the awareness oI limited data and let the
chips Iall as they may. The greater oXr awareness, however, the more and
more data we mXst assimilate and integrate into oXr decision-maNing. The
more we  Nnow, the more comple[   decisions become. Yet the  more and
more we Nnow, the more it begins to become possible to predict MXst where
the chips will  Iall.  II we  assXme the responsibility oI attempting to predict
accXrately MXst where each  chip   will   Iall,   we   are  liNely  to   Ieel   so
overwhelmed by the comple[ity   oI  the tasN as to sinN into inaction.  BXt,
then, inaction is itselI  a Iorm oI  action, and while  doing nothing might  be
the best coXrse oI action Xnder certain circXmstances, in others it may be
disastroXs and destrXctive. So spiritXal power is not simply awareness; it is
the capacity to maintain  one’s ability  to still   maNe decisions with greater

231
and greater awareness. And godliNe power is the power to maNe decisions
with total awareness. BXt XnliNe the popXlar notion oI it, omniscience does
not maNe decision-maNing easier; rather, it becomes ever more  diIIicXlt.
The closer one comes to godhood, the more one Ieels sympathy Ior God. To
participate in God’s omniscience is also to share His agony.
         There is another problem with power: aloneness. *
         *  I make a distinction  between aloneness and loneliness. Loneliness
is the unavailability  of people to communicate with on any level. Powerful
people are surrounded  by  others  only  too  eager to   communicate with
them; hence they  are seldom lonely  and may  even yearn for  loneliness.
Aloneness, however, is the unavailability of someone to communicate with
at your level of awareness.

         Here there is a similarity, in at least one dimension, between spiritXal
and political  power.  Someone who  is approaching the  peaN oI  spiritXal
evolXtion is liNe someone at the peaN oI political  power. There is no  one
above to whom to pass the bXcN; no one to blame; no one to tell yoX how to
do it. There may not even be anyone on the same level to share the agony or
the responsibility. Others may advise, bXt the decision is yoXrs alone. YoX
alone are responsible. In  another dimension,  the aloneness oI  enormoXs
spiritXal power is even greater than that oI political power. Since their level
oI awareness is seldom as high  as their  e[alted  positions, the politically
powerIXl almost  always have their  spiritXal  eTXals with whom  they  can
commXnicate. So presidents and Nings will have their Iriends and cronies.
BXt the  person who  has evolved  to  the  highest level  oI   awareness, oI
spiritXal power, will liNely have no one in his or her circle oI acTXaintances
with whom to share sXch depth oI Xnderstanding. One oI the most poignant
themes oI the Gospels is Christ’s continXal sense oI IrXstration on Iinding
that there was no one who coXld really Xnderstand him. No matter how hard
he tried, how mXch he e[tended himselI, he coXld not liIt the minds oI even
his own disciples to his level. The wisest Iollowed  him bXt coXld not catch
Xp with him, and all his love  coXld not relieve him oI the necessity to lead
by walNing ahead, Xtterly alone. This Nind oI aloneness is “shared” by all
who travel the Iarthest on the MoXrney oI spiritXal growth. It is sXch a bXrden
that it   simply  coXld  not  be borne  were it   not  Ior  the  Iact  that  as we
oXtdistance oXr Iellow hXmans oXr relationship to God inevitably becomes

232
correspondingly closer. In  the  commXnion oI  growing  conscioXsness, oI
Nnowing with God, there is enoXgh Moy to sXstain Xs.

         Grace    and  Mental     Illness;     The  Myth    of  Orestes


         A  nXmber oI seemingly disparate statements have been made aboXt
the natXre oI mental health and illness; “NeXrosis is always a sXbstitXte Ior
legitimate sXIIering”;  “Mental  health is dedication  to reality  at all  costs”;
and “Mental   illness  occXrs when  the  conscioXs will   oI   the  individXal
sXbstantially deviates Irom   the will    oI  God,  which  is  his  or  her  own
XnconscioXs will.” Let  Xs now  e[amine  the issXe oI mental  illness more
closely and Xnite these elements into a coherent whole.
         :e   live oXr lives in a real world. To live them well it  is necessary that
we come to Xnderstand the reality oI  the world  as best we can. BXt sXch
Xnderstanding does not come easily. Many  aspects oI  the reality   oI  the
world  and  oI  oXr relationship  to  the  world  are  painIXl  to  Xs. :e    can
Xnderstand them only throXgh eIIort and sXIIering. All oI Xs, to a greater or
lesser e[tent, attempt to avoid this  eIIort and sXIIering. :e    ignore painIXl
aspects oI reality by thrXsting certain Xnpleasant Iacts oXt oI oXr awareness.
In other  words, we  attempt to  deIend oXr conscioXsness, oXr awareness,
against reality. :e   do  this by  a variety  oI means which  psychiatrists call
deIense mechanisms. All oI Xs employ sXch deIenses, thereby limiting oXr
awareness. II in oXr laziness and Iear oI sXIIering we massively deIend oXr
awareness, then it will  come to  pass that oXr Xnderstanding oI the world
will  bear little or no relation to reality. BecaXse oXr actions are based on oXr
Xnderstanding, oXr behavior will then become Xnrealistic. :hen this occXrs
to a sXIIicient degree oXr Iellow citizens will  recognize that we are “oXt oI
toXch with reality,” and will  deem Xs mentally ill even thoXgh we oXrselves
are most liNely convinced oI oXr sanity. *
         *   I   recognize  that  this   schema of   mental  illness  is   somewhat
oversimplified. It   does not,  for   instance, take  into  account physical  or
biochemical  factors  which   may   be  of   large   and  even  predominant
significance in   certain  cases. I   also  recognize  that  it   is  possible  for
individuals  to be  so much  more in  touch  with  reality  than  their  fellow
citizens that they will  be deemed “insane” by a “sick society.” Nonetheless,

233
the schema presented here holds true in the vast majority  of  instances of
mental illness.

         BXt long beIore matters have proceeded to this e[treme, and we have
been served notice oI  oXr  illness by  oXr  Iellow  citizens,  we are  served
notice by oXr XnconscioXs oI oXr increasing maladMXstment. SXch notice is
served by oXr XnconscioXs throXgh a variety oI means: bad dreams, an[iety
attacNs, depressions, and other symptoms. AlthoXgh oXr conscioXs mind has
denied reality, oXr XnconscioXs, which is omniscient, Nnows the trXe score
and attempts to help Xs oXt by stimXlating, throXgh symptom Iormation, oXr
conscioXs mind to the awareness that something is wrong. In other words,
the painIXl and Xnwanted symptoms” oI mental illness are maniIestations oI
grace. “They are the prodXcts oI  a “powerIXl  Iorce originating  oXtside oI
conscioXsness which nXrtXres oXr spiritXal growth.”
         I  have  already pointed  oXt in   the brieI   discXssion oI  depression,
toward the end oI the Iirst  section on discipline, that depressive symptoms
are a sign to the sXIIering individXal that all is not right with him or her and
maMor adMXstments need to be made. Many oI the case histories I have Xsed
to demonstrate other principles can also be Xsed to illXstrate this one: that
the Xnpleasant symptoms oI mental illness serve to notiIy people that they
have taNen the wrong path, that  their  spirits are  not growing  and are in
grave Meopardy. BXt let me brieIly describe one more case to speciIically
demonstrate the role oI symptoms.
         Betsy was a twenty-two-year-old  woman, lovely  and intelligent  bXt
with a demXre almost virginal TXality to her, who came to see me Ior severe
an[iety  attacNs. She was the only child oI  Catholic worNing-class parents
who had  scrimped and saved to  send her  to  college. AIter  one  year oI
college, however, despite the Iact that she had done well academically, she
decided to drop oXt and marry the boy ne[t  door, a  mechanic. She tooN a
Mob as a clerN in a sXpermarNet. All went  well  Ior  two  years. BXt then,
sXddenly, came the an[iety   attacNs. OXt oI  the blXe. They  were  totally
Xnpredictable—e[cept that when they did occXr she was always oXt oI her
apartment somewhere withoXt her hXsband. They might happen when she
was shopping, when she was at her Mob in the sXpermarNet, or simply when
she was walNing down the street. The intensity oI the panic she Ielt at these
times was overwhelming. She woXld have to drop whatever she was doing

234
and woXld literally  rXn bacN to her apartment or else to the garage where
her hXsband worNed. Only when she was with him or  at home woXld the
panic sXbside. BecaXse oI the attacNs she had to TXit her Mob.
         :hen   tranTXilizers given her by her general practitioner Iailed to stop
or even toXch the intensity oI  her panic attacNs Betsy came to see me. “I
don’t Nnow what’s wrong  with  me,” she wailed.  “Everything  in my  liIe’s
wonderIXl. My  hXsband is good to me. :e    love each other very  mXch. I
enMoyed my Mob. Now everything’s  awIXl.  I  don’t  Nnow  why  this  has
happened to me. I Ieel I’m maybe going crazy. Please help me. Please help
me so that things can be  nice liNe they Xsed to be.”  BXt oI  coXrse Betsy
discovered in oXr worN together that things were not so “nice” the way they
Xsed to be. First, slowly  and painIXlly, it  emerged that while her hXsband
was good to her, varioXs things aboXt him irritated her. His manners were
XncoXth. His range  oI  interests were  narrow.  All   he wanted  to  do  Ior
entertainment was watch TV. He bored  her. Then she began to recognize
that worNing as a cashier in a sXpermarNet also bored her. So we began to
asN why she had leIt college Ior sXch an XnstimXlating e[istence. “:ell,    I
got more  and more  XncomIortable there,” she acNnowledged. “The  Nids
were into drXgs and se[ a lot.  I didn’t  Ieel right  aboXt it. They TXestioned
me, not MXst the boys who wanted to have se[ with me, bXt even my  girl
Iriends. They thoXght I was naive. I IoXnd I was even beginning to TXestion
myselI, to TXestion the chXrch and even some oI my parents’ valXes. I gXess
I got scared.” In  therapy Betsy now started to proceed with the process oI
TXestioning that she had rXn away Irom by leaving college. Ultimately she
retXrned to college. FortXnately, in this instance, her hXsband proved willing
to  grow  with  her  and  went  to  college  himselI.  Their  horizons  rapidly
broadened. And oI coXrse her an[iety attacNs ceased.
         There are several ways  to  looN at this  rather typical   case. Betsy’s
an[iety  attacNs were clearly a  Iorm  oI agoraphobia (literally,  Iear  oI  the
marNetplace, bXt XsXally Iear oI open spaces), and Ior her represented a Iear
oI  Ireedom.  She had  them  when  she was  oXtside, Xnhindered by   her
hXsband, Iree to move aboXt and relate with others. Fear oI Ireedom was the
essence oI her mental  illness.  some might  say that  the  an[iety  attacNs,
representing her Iear oI Ireedom, were her illness. BXt I have IoXnd it more
XseIXl and enlightening to looN at things another way. For Betsy’s Iear oI
Ireedom long predated her an[iety attacNs. It was becaXse oI this Iear that

235
she had  leIt   college  and   had  begXn the  process  oI   constricting  her
development. In my MXdgment Betsy was ill at that time, three years beIore
her symptoms began. Yet she was not aware oI her illness or oI the damage
she was doing  to herselI  by  her selI-constriction.  It  was her  symptoms,
these an[iety attacNs which she did not want and had not asNed Ior, which
she Ielt had “cXrsed” her “oXt oI  the blXe,” that made her Iinally  aware oI
her illness and Iorced  her to set oXt  Xpon the path oI  selI-correction and
growth. I  believe that this  pattern holds trXe Ior most  mental illness. The
symptoms and the illness are  not the same thing.  The illness  e[ists  long
beIore the symptoms. Rather than being the illness, the symptoms are the
beginning oI its  cXre. The Iact that they are Xnwanted maNes them all the
more  a  phenomenon oI   grace—a  giIt   oI   God,  a  message Irom   the
XnconscioXs, iI yoX will, to initiate selI-e[amination and repair.
         As is  common with  grace, most reMect this giIt and do not heed the
message. They do this  in  a  variety  oI  ways,  all  oI  which  represent an
attempt to avoid the responsibility  Ior  their illness. They try  to  ignore the
symptoms by pretending that they are not really  symptoms, that everyone
gets “these little attacNs Irom time to time.” They try  to worN aroXnd them
by TXitting Mobs, stopping driving, moving to a new town, avoiding certain
activities. They attempt to rid  themselves oI the symptoms by pain-Nillers,
by little pills  they’ve gotten Irom the doctor or by  anesthetizing themselves
with alcohol and other drXgs. Even iI they do accept the Iact that they have
symptoms, they will XsXally, in many sXbtle ways, blame the world oXtside
them—Xncaring relatives, Ialse Iriends, greedy corporations, a sicN society,
and  even   Iate—Ior    their   condition.    Only   those   Iew   who    accept
responsibility Ior  their  symptoms, who  realize that their  symptoms are a
maniIestation oI  a disorder in  their  own soXl, heed the  message oI their
XnconscioXs and accept its grace. They accept their own inadeTXacy and the
pain oI the worN necessary to heal themselves. BXt to them, as to Betsy and
all the others willing to Iace the pain oI psychotherapy, comes great reward.
It was oI them that Christ  spoNe in the Iirst oI the beatitXdes: “Blessed are
the poor in spirit, Ior theirs is the Kingdom oI Heaven.” *
         * Matthew  5:3.

         :hat   I  am saying here oI the relationship between grace and mental
illness is beaXtiIXlly embodied in the great GreeN myth oI Orestes and the

236
FXries. †
         † There  are many different  versions of  this myth,  with  substantial
differences between them. No one version is the correct one. The version
given here  is  mostly  condensed from  Edith  Hamilton’s Mythology (New
York: Mentor  Books, New American Library, 1958). I was led to this myth
through Rollo  May’s use of it  in  his book LoYe and Will and that  of T. S.
Eliot in  his play 7he Family Reunion.

         Orestes was a grandson oI AtreXs, a man who had vicioXsly attempted
to prove himselI more powerIXl than the gods. BecaXse oI his crime against
them, the gods pXnished AtreXs by placing a cXrse Xpon all his descendants.
As part oI  the enactment oI this cXrse Xpon the HoXse oI AtreXs, Orestes’
mother, Clytemnestra, mXrdered his Iather and her hXsband, Agamemnon.
This crime in tXrn broXght down the cXrse Xpon Orestes’ head, becaXse by
the GreeN code oI  honor a  son was obliged,  above all  else, to  slay  his
Iather’s mXrderer. Yet the greatest sin a GreeN coXld commit was the sin oI
matricide. Orestes agonized  over  his  dilemma. Finally   he  did  what  he
seemingly had  to do  and  Nilled his  mother.  For this  sin  the  gods then
pXnished Orestes by visiting Xpon him the FXries, three ghastly harpies who
coXld be seen and heard only by him and who tormented him night and day
with their cacNling criticism and Irightening appearance.
         PXrsXed wherever he went by the FXries, Orestes wandered aboXt the
land seeNing to atone Ior his crime. AIter  many years oI  lonely reIlection
and selI-abrogation Orestes reTXested the gods to relieve him oI the cXrse
on the HoXse oI  AtreXs and its  visitations  Xpon him throXgh the  FXries,
stating his belieI  that he  had sXcceeded in atoning Ior the  mXrder oI his
mother. A trial was held by the gods. SpeaNing in Orestes’ deIense, Apollo
argXed that he had engineered the whole sitXation that had placed Orestes in
the position in which he had no choice bXt to Nill his mother, and thereIore
Orestes really coXld not be held responsible. At this point Orestes MXmped
Xp and contradicted his own deIender, stating, “It  was I,  not  Apollo,  that
mXrdered my mother!” The gods were amazed. Never beIore had a member
oI the HoXse oI AtreXs assXmed sXch total responsibility Ior himselI and not
blamed the gods. EventXally the gods decided the  trial in  Orestes’ Iavor,
and not only relieved him  oI  the cXrse Xpon the HoXse oI AtreXs bXt also

237
transIormed the FXries into the EXmenides, loving spirits who throXgh their
wise coXnsel enabled Orestes to obtain continXing good IortXne.
         The  meaning  oI   this  myth   is  not  obscXre.  The  EXmenides, or
“benignant  ones,” are  also  reIerred  to  as the  “bearers  oI  grace.”  The
hallXcinatory FXries, who coXld be perceived only by Orestes, represent his
symptoms, the private  hell  oI  mental  illness. The  transIormation  oI  the
FXries into the EXmenides is the transIormation oI mental illness into good
IortXne, oI which we have been speaNing. This transIormation occXrred by
virtXe oI the  Iact that Orestes was willing   to accept responsibility  Ior his
mental illness. :hile   he Xltimately soXght to be relieved oI them, he did not
see the FXries as an XnMXst pXnishment or perceive himselI to be a victim oI
society or oI anything else. Being an inevitable resXlt oI  the original cXrse
Xpon the HoXse oI AtreXs, the FXries also symbolize the Iact  that mental
illness is a Iamily aIIair, created in one by one’s parents and grandparents as
the sins oI  the Iather  are visited  Xpon the children.  BXt Orestes did  not
blame his Iamily—his  parents or his grandIather—as he well  might have.
Nor did  he blame the gods or “Iate.”  Instead he accepted his condition as
one oI his own maNing and XndertooN the eIIort to heal it. It was a lengthy
process, MXst as most therapy tends to be lengthy. BXt as a resXlt he was
healed, and throXgh this healing process oI his own eIIort, the very things
that had once caXsed him agony became the same things that broXght him
wisdom.
         All  e[perienced  psychotherapists have seen this myth  acted oXt in
their own  practices and have actXally witnessed the transIormation oI the
FXries into  the  EXmenides within   the  minds  and  lives   oI  their   more
sXccessIXl patients. It is not an easy transIormation. As soon as they realize
that they will   Xltimately  be reTXired by  the process oI psychotherapy to
assXme total responsibility Ior their condition and its cXre, most patients, no
matter how eager Ior  therapy they initially   appeared to be, will  drop oXt.
They choose rather to be sicN and have the gods to blame than to be well
with no one to blame ever again. OI the minority who stay in therapy most
mXst still be taXght to assXme total responsibility Ior themselves as a part oI
their healing. This teaching—“training”  might be a more accXrate word—is
a painstaNing aIIair as the  therapist methodically  conIronts patients with
their avoidance oI  responsibility again and  again and again, session aIter
session, month aIter  month,  and  oIten year  aIter  year. FreTXently, liNe

238
stXbborn children, they will NicN and scream all the way as they are led to
the notion oI total  responsibility Ior  themselves. EventXally, however, they
arrive. It  is only  the rare patient who enters therapy with  a willingness to
assXme total responsibility  Irom  the  beginning.  Therapy in   sXch cases,
while it still  may reTXire a year or two, is relatively brieI, relatively smooth,
and IreTXently a very pleasant process Ior both patient and therapist. In any
case, whether relatively easy or diIIicXlt and prolonged, the transIormation
oI the FXries into  the EXmenides does occXr. Those who have Iaced their
mental illness, accepted total responsibility Ior  it, and made the necessary
changes in themselves to overcome it, Iind themselves not only cXred and
Iree  Irom   the  cXrses oI   their   childhood  and  ancestry  bXt  also   Iind
themselves living in a new  and diIIerent world.  :hat   they once perceived
as problems they now perceive as opportXnities. :hat were once loathsome
barriers  are  now  welcome  challenges.  ThoXghts  previoXsly  Xnwanted
become helpIXl insights; Ieelings previoXsly disowned become soXrces oI
energy and gXidance. OccXrrences that once seemed to be bXrdens now
seem to  be giIts,   inclXding  the very  symptoms  Irom  which   they have
recovered. “My depression and my an[iety attacNs were the best things that
ever happened  to  me,”  they   will   roXtinely  say  at  the  termination  oI
sXccessIXl therapy. Even iI they emerge Irom therapy withoXt  a belieI  in
God, sXch sXccessIXl patients still generally do so with  a very  real sense
that they have been toXched by grace.

         Resistance    to   Grace


         Orestes did not go to a psychotherapist; he healed himselI. And even
had there been e[pert psychiatrists in  ancient Greece he still  woXld have
had to heal himselI.  For, as has been mentioned, psychotherapy is only a
tool—a discipline.  It  is Xp to the  patient to choose or reMect the tool, and
once chosen, it is the patient who determines how mXch to Xse the tool and
to what end. There are people who will overcome all manner oI obstacles—
Ior  e[ample,   insXIIicient   IXnds,  previoXs  disastroXs e[periences  with
psychiatrists or psychotherapists, disapproving relatives, cold and reMecting
clinics—to  obtain  therapy and  every  last oXnce oI  its  possible  beneIit.
Others, however, will  reMect therapy even iI it is oIIered them on  a silver

239
platter,  or   else,  even  iI   they   do  become  engaged  in   a  therapeXtic
relationship, will  sit  in it  liNe a bXmp on  a log, e[tracting  Irom  it  almost
nothing no matter how great the therapist’s sNill and eIIort and love. :hile
at the conclXsion oI a sXccessIXl case I am tempted to Ieel that I have cXred
the patient, I Nnow the reality oI  the sitXation is that I  have been no more
than a  catalyst—and IortXnate to  be  that.  Since Xltimately  people  heal
themselves with or withoXt the tool oI psychotherapy, why is it that so Iew
do and so many do not? Since the path oI spiritXal growth, albeit diIIicXlt, is
open to all, why do so Iew choose to travel it?
         It  was to this  TXestion that Christ was addressing himselI  when he
said, “Many are called, bXt Iew are chosen.”*
         * Matthew  22: 14; see also Matthew 20: 16.

         BXt why is it that the Iew are chosen, and what is it that distingXishes
those Iew  Irom   the many?  The  answer that  most  psychotherapists are
accXstomed to  give   is  based  on   a  concept  oI   diIIering   severity  oI
psychopathology . In other words, they believe that while  most people are
sicN, some are sicNer than others, and the sicNer one is the more diIIicXlt it
is Ior that one to be healed. Moreover, the severity oI one’s mental illness is
directly  determined  by  the  severity   and  the  earliness oI   the  parental
deprivation  that one  e[perienced  in  childhood.  SpeciIically,  individXals
with psychoses are thoXght to have e[perienced e[tremely poor parenting in
the Iirst  nine months oI  liIe’  their  resXlting illness can be ameliorated by
this  or  that   Iorm  oI   treatment,  bXt  it   is  almost  impossible   to  cXre.
IndividXals  with   character disorders  are  thoXght  to   have  e[perienced
adeTXate care as inIants bXt very  poor  care dXring  the  period between
roXghly rXne months and two years oI age, with the resXlt that they are less
sicN than psychotics bXt still  TXite sicN indeed and very diIIicXlt  to  cXre.
IndividXals with  neXroses are thoXght to have received adeTXate parenting
in their very early childhood  bXt then to have sXIIered Irom poor parenting
sometime aIter the age oI two bXt XsXally beginning beIore the age oI Iive
or si[.  NeXrotics are thereIore thoXght to be less sicN than either character-
disordered people or psychotics, and conseTXently mXch easier to treat and
cXre.
         There is, I believe, a good deal oI trXth to this schema and it Iorms a
body oI psychiatric theory that is TXite XseIXl to practitioners in a nXmber oI

240
ways. It  shoXld not be blithely   criticized.  Nonetheless, it Iails  to tell  the
whole  story. Among  other  things,  it  denigrates  the vast  importance  oI
parenting in   late childhood   and adolescence. There  is  good  reason to
believe that poor parenting in these later years can prodXce mental illness in
and oI itselI, and that good parenting dXring the later years can heal many
and perhaps all oI the woXnds caXsed by earlier poor parenting. Moreover,
while the schema has predictive: valXe in a statistical sense—neXrotics are,
on the average, easier to treat than character-disordered persons, and those
with character disorders are, on the average, easier to treat than psychotics
—it   Iails to  predict very well  the coXrse oI growth  in an individXal  case.
ThXs, Ior   e[ample,  the  most  rapid  coXrse oI   a  completely  sXccessIXl
analysis I have ever  condXcted was with a man  who came to  me with  a
maMor psychosis and whose therapy was conclXded nine months later. On
the other hand, I  worNed Ior  three years with  a woman who  clearly  had
“only”  a neXrosis and achieved MXst only minimal improvement.
         Among the Iactors that the schema oI the diIIering severity oI mental
illness Iails to taNe into accoXnt is an ephemeral something in the individXal
patient which   might  be  called  a “will    to  grow.”   It  is  possible  Ior  an
individXal to be e[tremely ill  and yet at the same time possess an e[tremely
strong “will  to grow,” in which case healing will occXr. On the other hand, a
person who is only mildly  ill,  as best we can deIine psychiatric illness, bXt
who lacNs the  will  to  grow,  will   not  bXdge an inch  Irom  an Xnhealthy
position. I thereIore believe that the patient’s will to grow is the one crXcial
determinant oI sXccess or IailXre in psychotherapy. Yet it is a Iactor that is
not  at all   Xnderstood or  even  recognized by  contemporary  psychiatric
theory. AlthoXgh I  am recognizing the e[treme  importance oI  this will  to
grow,  I  am   not  sXre how   mXch  I  will    be  able  to  contribXte  to  its
Xnderstanding, since the  concept brings  Xs  once again  to  the  edge oI
mystery. It will  be immediately apparent that the will to grow  is in essence
the same phenomenon as  love.  Love  is  the  will   to  e[tend  oneselI Ior
spiritXal  growth.  GenXinely  loving   people are,  by   deIinition,  growing
people. I have spoNen aboXt how the capacity to love is nXrtXred in one by
loving parenting, bXt I have also noted that parental nXrtXring alone Iails to
accoXnt Ior the  e[istence oI  this  capacity in  all  people. The  reader will
remember that  the   second section  oI   this  booN  conclXded with   IoXr
TXestions aboXt love, two oI  which  we  are now  considering: why  some

241
people Iail to  respond to treatment by the best and most loving therapists,
and why  some  people transcend the  most loveless  childhoods, with   or
withoXt the help oI  psychotherapy, to become themselves loving persons.
The reader will also remember I stated then that I doXbted that I woXld be
able  to  answer  these  TXestions  to  anyone’s  complete  satisIaction.   I
sXggested, however, that some light coXld be thrown on these TXestions by
consideration oI the concept oI grace.
         I  have come to believe  and have tried to  demonstrate that people’s
capacity to love, and hence their will  to  grow, is nXrtXred not only by  the
love oI  their  parents dXring childhood bXt  also throXghoXt their lives  by
grace,  or   God’s   love.   This   is   a  powerIXl   Iorce   e[ternal   to   their
conscioXsness which operates throXgh the agency oI their own XnconscioXs
as well as throXgh the agency oI loving persons other than their parents and
throXgh additional ways which we do not Xnderstand. It is becaXse oI grace
that it is possible Ior  people to transcend the traXmas oI loveless parenting
and become .themselves loving individXals who have risen Iar above their’
parents on the scale oI hXman evolXtion. :hy,   then, do only some people
spiritXally grow and evolve beyond the circXmstances oI their parentage? I
believe that grace is available to  everyone, that we are all  cloaNed in the
love oI  God, no one less nobly than another. The only answer I  can give,
thereIore, is that most oI Xs choose not to heed the call oI grace and to reMect
its assistance. Christ’s assertion “Many  are called, bXt Iew  are chosen” I
woXld translate to mean” All oI Xs are called by and to grace, bXt Iew oI Xs
choose to listen to the call.”
         The TXestion, then, becomes: :hy   is it  that so Iew  oI  Xs choose to
heed the call oI grace? :hy   do most oI Xs actXally resist grace? :e  spoNe
earlier oI grace providing Xs with a certain XnconscioXs resistance to illness.
How  is it,   then, that  we seem to  possess an almost eTXal resistance to
health? ‘The answer to this TXestion has, in Iact, already been given. It  is
oXr laziness, the original sin oI entropy with which we have all been cXrsed.
JXst as grace is the Xltimate soXrce oI the Iorce that pXshes Xs to ascend the
ladder oI hXman evolXtion, so it is entropy that caXses Xs to resist that Iorce,
to stay at the comIortable, easy rXng where we now Iire or even to descend
to less and less demanding Iorms  oI e[istence.  :e   have talNed at length
aboXt how  diIIicXlt   it  is  to  discipline   oXrselves, to  genXinely love,  to
spiritXally grow. It is only  natXral that we shoXld shrinN Irom the diIIicXlty.

242
:hile    we have dealt with the basics oI the problem oI entropy or laziness,
there is  one aspect oI  the problem  that  deserves, once again, particXlar
mention: the issXe oI power.
         Psychiatrists  and  many  laymen  are   Iamiliar   with   the  Iact   that
psychiatric  problems  occXr  with   remarNable IreTXency  in   individXals
shortly aIter promotion to positions oI higher power and responsibility. The
military  psychiatrist,  who  is   particXlarly  Iamiliar  with   this  problem  oI
“promotion neXrosis,” is  also aware that the problem does not occXr with
even greater IreTXency, becaXse vast nXmbers oI soldiers are sXccessIXl in
resisting their promotions  in the Iirst  place. There are a  great many low-
ranNing career noncommissioned  oIIicers  who  simply   do  not  want  to
become top sergeants, Iirst sergeants or sergeant maMors. And there are also
large nXmbers oI intelligent  noncommissioned oIIicers  who woXld  rather
die than become oIIicers and who, oIten repeatedly, reMect oIIers oI oIIicer
training Ior  which, by  virtXe oI their  intelligence and stability, they woXld
seem to be well TXaliIied. And  so it is  with  spiritXal growth as well  as in
proIessional liIe. For the call to grace is a promotion, a call to a position oI
higher  responsibility  and  power.  To  be  aware oI   grace, to  personally
e[perience its constant presence, to Nnow one’s nearness to God, is to Nnow
and continXally e[perience an inner tranTXility and peace that Iew possess.
On  the  other  hand,  this  Nnowledge and  awareness brings  with   it  an
enormoXs responsibility. For to e[perience one’s closeness to God is also to
e[perience the obligation to be God, to be the agent oI His power and love.
The call to grace is a call to a liIe oI eIIortIXl caring, to a liIe oI  service and
whatever sacriIice seems reTXired. It is a call oXt oI spiritXal childhood into
adXlthood, a call  to be a  parent Xnto manNind. T. S.  Eliot  described the
matter well in  the Christmas sermon he had Thomas BecNet deliver in the
play Murder in the Cathedral:

         BXt thinN Ior  a while on  the meaning oI this  word “peace.”  Does it
seem strange to yoX that the angels shoXld have annoXnced Peace, when
ceaselessly the world has been stricNen with war and the Iear oI war? Does
it seem to yoX that the angelic voices were mistaNen, and that the promise
was a disappointment and a cheat? .ReIlect now, .how ,oXr Lord  HimselI
spoNe oI Peace. He said to His disciples “My  peace I leave with yoX, my
peace I give Xnto yoX.” Did He mean peace as we thinN oI it: the Ningdom

243
oI England at peace with its neighboXrs, the barons at peace with the King,
the hoXseholder coXnting over his peaceIXl gains, the swept hearth, his best
wine Ior a Iriend  at the table, his wiIe  singing to the children? Those men
His disciples Nnew no sXch things: they went Iorth to MoXrney aIar, to sXIIer
by land and sea, to Nnow tortXre, imprisonment, disappointment, to sXIIer
death by martyrdom. :hat    then did He  mean? II yoX asN that, remember
then ,that He said also, “Not as the world gives, give I  Xnto yoX.” So then,
He gave to His disciples peace, bXt not peace as the world gives. *

Brace, 1952), pp. 198-99.

         So with  the  peace oI grace come  agonizing responsibilities  dXties,
obligations. It is not remarNable that so many well-TXaliIied sergeants have
no desire to  assXme the mantle oI  an oIIicer.  And  it  is  no  wonder that
patients in psychotherapy have little taste Ior  the power that accompanies
genXine mental health. A yoXng woman who had been in therapy with me
Ior a year Ior  a pervasive depression, and who had come to learn a  good
deal aboXt the psychopathology oI her relatives, was e[Xltant one day aboXt
a Iamily   sitXation  that  she had  handled with   wisdom,  eTXanimity and
Iacility. “I  really  Ielt good aboXt it,” she said. “I  wish I coXld Ieel that way
more oIten.” I told her that she coXld, pointing oXt to her that the reason she
had Ielt so well was that Ior the Iirst time in dealing with her Iamily she was
in a position  oI power,  being aware oI all  their  distorted commXnications
and the  devioXs ways  in  which  they  attempted to  manipXlate her  into
IXlIilling  their Xnrealistic demands, and thereIore she was able to be on top
oI  the sitXation. I   told  her that  as she was  able to  e[tend  this  type  oI
awareness to other sitXations she woXld Iind herselI increasingly on “top oI
things”  and  thereIore  e[periencing   that  good  Ieeling   more  and  more
IreTXently. She looNed at me with the beginning oI a sense oI horror. “BXt
that woXld reTXire me to be thinNing all the time!”  she said. I agreed with
her that it was throXgh a lot oI thinNing that her power woXld evolve and be
maintained, and that she woXld be rid oI the Ieeling oI powerlessness at the
root oI her depression. She became IXrioXs. “I don’t want to have to thinN
all the goddamn time,”  she roared. “I  didn’t  come here Ior  my  liIe  to be
made more diIIicXlt. I  want to be able to MXst rela[ and enMoy myselI. YoX
e[pect me to be some sort oI god or something!” Sad to say, it was shortly

244
aIterward that  this  potentially  brilliant   woman terminated  treatment, Iar
short oI  being healed, terriIied  oI  the demands that mental health woXld
reTXire oI her.
         It  may  soXnd strange to laymen,  bXt psychotherapists are Iamiliar
with the Iact  that people are roXtinely terriIied  by mental health. A  maMor
part oI   the tasN oI  psychotherapy  is  not  only  to  bring  patients  to  the
e[perience oI  mental  health bXt also,  throXgh a  mi[tXre  oI  consolation,
reassXrance and sternness, to prevent them Irom rXnning away Irom that
e[perience once they have arrived  at it.  One aspect oI  this IearIXlness is
rather legitimate and, by itselI, not Xnhealthy: the Iear that iI  one becomes
powerIXl one might misXse power. Saint AXgXstine wrote, ‘‘Dilige et quod
Yis fac,” meaning “II yoX are loving and diligent, yoX may do whatever yoX
want.” *
         *1Jn. 7. PatrologiaLatina, 35,2033

         II  people progress Iar enoXgh in psychotherapy they will  eventXally
leave behind  the  Ieeling   that  they  cannot cope  with   a  merciless and
overwhelming world and will  one day sXddenly realize that they have it in
their power to  do whatever they  want. The realization  oI  this Ireedom is
Irightening.  “II  I  can  do whatever  I  want,”  they will   thinN, “what   is to
prevent me Irom  maNing gross mistaNes, Irom committing   crimes, Irom
being immoral, Irom abXsing my Ireedom and power? Is my diligence and
my love alone sXIIicient  to govern me?”  II the  realization oI one’s power
and Ireedom  is e[perienced  as  a call  to  grace, as  it  oIten  is,  then the
response will also be, “O Lord, I Iear I am not worthy  oI yoXr trXst in me.”
This IearIXlness is, oI coXrse, itselI an integral part oI  one’s diligence and
love, and thereIore XseIXl in the selI-governance that prevents the abXse oI
power. For this  reason it is  not  to be cast aside; bXt it  shoXld not  be so
monXmental as to prevent  a person Irom   heeding the call  to  grace and
assXming the power oI which  he or she is capable. Some who have been
called to grace may wrestle Ior years with their IearIXlness beIore they are
able to   transcend it   so  as to   accept their   own  godliness.  :hen    this
IearIXlness and sense oI Xnworthiness is so great as to consistently prevent
the assXmption oI power, it is a neXrotic problem, and dealing with it may
be a central issXe or even the central issXe in one’s psychotherapy.

245
         BXt Ior  most people the Iear that they might  abXse the power is not
the central issXe in  their resistance to grace. It  is  not the  “Do  what  yoX
want” part oI Saint AXgXstine’s ma[im that caXses them indigestion bXt the
“Be diligent”   part. Most oI  Xs are liNe children or  yoXng adolescents; we
believe that the Ireedom and power oI  adXlthood is oXr dXe, bXt we have
little  taste Ior   adXlt responsibility  and  selI-discipline.  MXch  as we  Ieel
oppressed by oXr parents—or by society or Iate—we actXally seem to need
to have powers above Xs to blame Ior oXr condition. To rise to a position oI
sXch power that we have no one to blame e[cept oXrselves is a IearIXl state
oI aIIairs. As  has already been mentioned, were it not Ior  God’s presence
with  Xs in that e[alted  position,  we woXld  be terriIied  by  oXr aloneness.
Still,  many have so little  capacity to  tolerate the aloneness oI power that
they reMect God’s presence rather than e[perience themselves as the sole
master oI  their  ship. Most  people  want peace withoXt  the  aloneness oI
power. And they want  the selI-conIidence oI adXlthood withoXt having  to
grow Xp.
         :e   have spoNen in varioXs ways aboXt how diIIicXlt it is to grow Xp.
A very  Iew march Xnambivalently and Xnhesitatingly into adXlthood, ever
eager Ior new and greater responsibilities. Most drag their Ieet and in  Iact
never become more than partial adXlts, always shrinNing Irom the demands
oI total adXlthood. So it is with  spiritXal growth, which is inseparable Irom
the process oI psychological matXration. For the call to grace in its Xltimate
Iorm  is a  sXmmons to be one  with  God, to  assXme peership with God.
Hence it is a  call to  total adXlthood. :e   are accXstomed to imagining the
e[perience  oI   conversion  or  sXdden call   to   grace as  an  “Oh,   Moy!”
phenomenon. In my e[perience, more oIten than not it is, at least partially,
an “Oh, shit”  phenomenon. At the moment we Iinally  listen to the call  we
may say, “Oh, thanN yoX, Lord”; or we may say, “O Lord, I am not worthy”;
or we may say, “O Lord, do I have to?”
         So the  Iact  that  “many  are  called  bXt Iew   are chosen”  is  easily
e[plainable in  view oI  the diIIicXlties  inherent in responding to the call  to
grace. The TXestion we are leIt with, then, is not why people Iail to  accept
psychotherapy, or Iail  to  beneIit Irom  it  even in  the  best hands, or why
hXmans roXtinely resist grace; the Iorce oI  entropy maNes it only  natXral
that they shoXld do so. Rather, the TXestion is the opposite: How is it that a
Iew do heed the call that is so diIIicXlt? :hat distingXishes the Iew Irom the

246
many? I am Xnable to answer this TXestion. These people may come Irom
wealthy, cXltXred bacNgroXnds or Irom impoverished, sXperstitioXs ones.
They may  have e[perienced  basically  loving  parenting,  bXt they  are as
liNely to  have e[perienced  proIoXnd deprivation  oI  parental aIIection  or
genXine concern.   They  may   enter  psychotherapy  becaXse oI    minor
diIIicXlties oI  adMXstment or with overwhelming mental illness. They may
be old  or  yoXng.  They may  heed the  call  to  grace sXddenly  and with
apparent ease. Or they may Iight and cXrse against it, only  gradXally and
painIXlly giving way to it,  inch by inch. ConseTXently, with e[perience over
the  years, I   have actXally  become  less  rather than  more  selective  in
determining with whom  I will   attempt therapy. I apologize to those I have
e[clXded Irom therapy as a resXlt oI my ignorance. For I have learned that
in the earlier stages oI the psychotherapeXtic process I have absolXtely no
ability to predict which oI  my patients will Iail  to respond to therapy, which
will   respond with   signiIicant  bXt  still   partial  growth,  and  which  will,
miracXloXsly, grow all the way to the state oI grace. Christ himselI spoNe oI
the Xnpredictability oI grace when he said to NicodemXs: “JXst as yoX can
hear the wind bXt can’t tell where it comes Irom or where it will go ne[t, so
it is with  the Spirit. :e   do not Nnow on whom he will  ne[t  bestow this liIe
Irom heaven.” *
         * John 3:8. This  translation is taken from  the LiYing Bible because it
seems to me superior to the King James version.

         MXch as we have been able to say aboXt the phenomenon oI grace, in
the end we are leIt having to acNnowledge its mysterioXs natXre.

         The  Welcoming      of  Grace


         And we  are leIt  again Iacing parado[.  ThroXghoXt this booN I have
been writing oI spiritXal growth as iI it were an orderly, predictable process.
It has been implied that spiritXal growth may be learned as one might learn
a Iield oI· Nnowledge throXgh a Ph.D. program; iI yoX pay yoXr tXition and
worN hard enoXgh, oI coXrse yoX will sXcceed and get yoXr degree. I have
interpreted Christ’s saying “Many  are called bXt Iew are chosen” to  mean
that very Iew  choose to heed the call  oI  grace becaXse oI the diIIicXlties

247
involved. By  this  interpretation  I  have indicated that  whether or  not  we
become blessed by grace is a matter oI oXr choice. Essentially, I have been
saying that grace is earned. And I Nnow this to be trXe.
         At the same time, however, I Nnow that that’s not the way it is at all.
:e   do not  come to grace; grace comes to  Xs. Try as we might  to  obtain
grace, it  may  yet  elXde  Xs. :e    may  seeN it  not,  yet  it   will   Iind  Xs.
ConscioXsly we may avidly  desire the  spiritXal liIe  bXt then  discover all
manner oI stXmbling blocNs in oXr way. Or we  may have seemingly little
taste Ior the spiritXal liIe  and yet  Iind  oXrselves vigoroXsly called to it  in
spite oI oXrselves. :hile  on one level we do choose whether or not to heed
the call oI grace, on another it seems clear that God is the one who does the
choosing. The common e[perience oI  those who have achieved a state oI
grace, on whom “this new liIe  Irom  heaven” has been bestowed, is one oI
amazement at their condition.  They do  not Ieel  that they have earned it.
:hile    they may  have a realistic  awareness oI the particXlar goodness oI
their natXre, they do not ascribe their natXre to their own will;  rather, they
distinctly Ieel  that the goodness oI their natXre has been created by hands
wiser and more sNilled than their own. Those who are the closest to grace
are the most aware oI the mysterioXs character oI the giIt  they have been
given.
         How do we resolve this parado[? :e    don’t. Perhaps the best that we
can say is that while  we cannot will   oXrselves to I grace, we can by  will
open oXrselves to its miracXloXs coming. :e   can prepare oXrselves to be
Iertile groXnd, a  welcoming place. II   we can maNe oXrselves into totally
disciplined,  wholly   loving   individXals,  then,  even  thoXgh we  may   be
ignorant oI  theology and give  no thoXght to God,  we will   have prepared
oXrselves well Ior the coming oI grace. Conversely, the stXdy oI theology is
a relatively poor  method oI preparation and, by itselI,  completely Xseless.
Nonetheless, I  have written   this  section becaXse I  do  believe  that  the
awareness oI the e[istence oI  grace can be  oI considerable assistance to
those who have chosen to travel the diIIicXlt  path oI spiritXal  growth. For
this awareness will Iacilitate their MoXrney in at least three ways: it will help
them to taNe advantage oI grace along the way; it  will   give them a sXrer
sense oI direction; and it will provide encoXragement.
         The parado[ that we both choose grace and are chosen by grace is the
essence oI the phenomenon oI serendipity. Serendipity was deIined as “the

248
giIt oI  Iinding  valXable or agreeable things not soXght Ior.” BXddha IoXnd
enlightenment only when he stopped seeNing Ior it—when he let it come to
him. On  the other hand, who  can doXbt that  enlightenment came to him
precisely becaXse he had devoted at least si[teen years oI his liIe seeNing it,
si[teen years in preparation? He had to both seeN Ior it and not seeN Ior it.
The FXries  were transIormed  into  the  Bearers oI   Grace also  precisely
becaXse Orestes both worNed to gain the Iavor oI the gods and at the same
time did not e[pect  the gods to maNe his way easy Ior him. It was throXgh
this same parado[ical mi[tXre  oI seeNing and not seeNing that he obtained
the giIt oI serendipity and the blessings oI grace.
         This same phenomenon is roXtinely demonstrated .by the manner in
which patients Xtilize dreams in psychotherapy. Some patients, aware oI the
Iact that dreams contain answers to their problems, will  avidly  seeN these
answers by   deliberately,   mechanically   and  with    considerable  eIIort,
recording each and every one oI their dreams in complete detail,  and will
literally  bring  to their  sessions reams oI dreams. BXt their dreams are oI
little  help to them. Indeed, all  this  dream material may be a hindrance to
their therapy. For one thing, there is not enoXgh therapy time to analyze all
these dreams. For another, this volXminoXs dream material may  serve to
prevent worN in more IrXitIXl areas oI analysis. And then it is liNely that all
this material will   be singXlarly obscXre. SXch patients mXst ,be taXght to
stop searching aIter their dreams, to let their  dreams come to them, to let
their   XnconscioXs maNe the   choice   oI   which   dreams  shoXld  enter
conscioXsness. This teaching itselI may be TXite diIIicXlt, demanding as it
does that the patient give Xp a certain amoXnt oI control and assXme a more
passive relationship in his  or her own  mind.  BXt once a patient learns to
maNe no conscioXs eIIort   to  clXtch at  dreams, the  remembered dream
material decreases in TXantity, bXt it dramatically increases in TXality. The
resXlt is that the patient’s dreams—these giIts Irom the XnconscioXs now no
longer soXght Ior—elegantly Iacilitate the healing process that is desired. II
we looN at the other side oI the coin, however, we Iind that there are many
patients  who   enter  psychotherapy  with   absolXtely   no  awareness  or
Xnderstanding oI   the  immense   valXe  that  dreams  can   be  to   them.
ConseTXently, they discard  Irom   conscioXsness all  dream  material  as
worthless and Xnimportant. These patients mXst Iirst be taXght to remember
their dreams and then how to  appreciate and perceive the treasXre within

249
them. To Xtilize dreams eIIectively we mXst worN to be aware oI their valXe
and to taNe advantage oI them when they  come to Xs, and we mXst also
worN sometimes at not seeNing or e[pecting them. :e mXst let them be trXe
giIts.
         So it  is  with  grace: :e   have already seen that dreams are bXt one
Iorm  or  way  in   which  the  giIts  oI   grace are  given  to  Xs.  The  same
parado[ical  approach shoXld  be employed  toward  all   the other  Iorms:
sXdden insights,   premonitions   and   a   whole   host   oI   synchronistic,
serendipitoXs events. And to all love. Everyone wants to be loved. BXt Iirst
we mXst maNe oXrselves lovable. :e  mXst prepare oXrselves to be loved.
:e   do this by becoming oXrselves loving, disciplined hXman beings. II we
seeN to be loved—iI we e[pect to be loved—this  cannot be accomplished;
we will   be dependent and grasping, hot  genXinely loving.  BXt when  we
nXrtXre oXrselves and others withoXt a primary concern oI Iinding reward,
then we will have become lovable, and the reward oI being loved, which we
have not soXght, will  Iind  Xs. So it  is with  hXman love and so  it is  with
God’s love.
         A maMor pXrpose oI this section on grace has been to assist those on
the MoXrney oI spiritXal growth to learn the capacity oI serendipity. And let
Xs redeIine serendipity  not  as a giIt   itselI  bXt as  a learned  capacity to
recognize and Xtilize the giIts oI grace which are given to  Xs Irom beyond
the realm oI  oXr conscioXs will. :ith     this capacity, we will   Iind  that oXr
MoXrney oI  spiritXal   growth   is    gXided  by   the   invisible   hand   and
Xnimaginable wisdom oI God with  inIinitely  greater accXracy than that oI
which  oXr  Xnaided conscioXs will   is  capable.  So  gXided, the  MoXrney
becomes ever Iaster.
         One way or  another, these concepts have been set Iorth beIore—by
BXddha, by Christ, by Lao-tse, among many others. The originality oI this
booN resXlts Irom the Iact that I have arrived at their same meaning throXgh
the particXlar individXal byways oI my twentieth-centXry liIe. II yoX reTXire
greater Xnderstanding than these modern Iootnotes have to oIIer, then by all
means proceed or retXrn to the ancient te[ts.  SeeN greater Xnderstanding,
bXt do not  e[pect greater detail.  There are many who,  by  virtXe oI  their
passivity, dependency, Iear and laziness, seeN to be shown every inch oI the
way and have it demonstrated to them that each step will be saIe and worth
their  while.  This  cannot  be  done. For  the  MoXrney oI spiritXal  growth

250
reTXires coXrage and initiative and  independence oI thoXght and  action.
:hile    the words oI the prophets and the assistance oI grace are available,
the MoXrney mXst still be traveled alone. No teacher can carry yoX there.
There are no preset IormXlas. RitXals are only learning aids, they are not the
learning. Eating  organic Iood,  saying Iive  Hail   Mary’s  beIore breaNIast,
praying Iacing east or west, or going to chXrch on SXnday will not taNe yoX
to yoXr destination. No words  can be said, no teaching can be taXght that
will  relieve spiritXal travelers Irom the necessity oI picNing their own ways,
worNing oXt with  eIIort  and an[iety   their  own paths throXgh the  XniTXe
circXmstances oI their own lives toward the identiIication oI their individXal
selves with God.
         Even when we trXly Xnderstand these matters, the MoXrney oI spiritXal
growth is still so lonely and diIIicXlt that we oIten become discoXraged. The
Iact that we live in a scientiIic age, while helpIXl in some respects, serves in
others to Ioster discoXragement. :e believe in the mechanical principles oI
the Xniverse; not in miracles. ThroXgh oXr science we have come to learn
that oXr dwelling place is bXt a single planet oI a single star lost amid one
gala[y  among many. And MXst as we seem lost amid the enormity oI  the
e[ternal  Xniverse, so  science has  also led  Xs  to  develop  an image  oI
oXrselves as being helplessly determined and governed by internal Iorces
not sXbMect to oXr will—by chemical molecXles in oXr brain and conIlicts in
oXr XnconscioXs that compel Xs to Ieel and to behave in certain ways when
we are not even aware oI  what  we are doing. So  the replacement oI oXr
hXman myths by scientiIic  inIormation has caXsed Xs to sXIIer a sense oI
personal meaninglessness. OI what possible signiIicance coXld we be, as
individXals or  even  as a  race, bXIIeted aboXt by  internal  chemical  and
psychological Iorces we do  not Xnderstand, invisible in a  Xniverse whose
dimensions are so large that even oXr science cannot measXre them?
         Yet it  is  that same science that has in  certain ways  assisted me to
perceive the  reality  oI  the  phenomenon oI   grace. I  have  attempted to
transmit that  perception. For  once we  perceive the reality  oI  grace, oXr
Xnderstanding oI oXrselves as meaningless and insigniIicant is  shattered.
The Iact   that  there e[ists   beyond  oXrselves and oXr  conscioXs will   a
powerIXl Iorce that nXrtXres oXr growth and evolXtion is enoXgh to tXm oXr
notions oI  selI-insigniIicance  topsy-tXrvy. For the  e[istence oI  this  Iorce
(once we  perceive  it)  indicates  with  incontrovertible  certainty  that  oXr

251
hXman spiritXal growth is  oI the  Xtmost importance to something greater
than oXrselves. This something  we  call  God. The  e[istence  oI  grace is
prima facie evidence not only  oI the reality  oI  God bXt also oI the reality
that God’s will   is  devoted to  the growth  oI  the individXal  hXman spirit.
:hat   once seemed to be a Iairy tale tXrns oXt to be the reality. :e live  oXr
lives in  the eye oI  God, and not at the  periphery bXt at the center oI  His
vision, His concern. It  is probable that the Xniverse as we Nnow it is bXt a
single stepping-stone toward the entrance to the Kingdom oI God. BXt we
are hardly lost in the Xniverse. To the contrary, the reality oI grace indicates
hXmanity to be at the center oI the Xniverse. This time and space e[ists Ior
Xs to travel throXgh. :hen   my patients lose sight oI their  signiIicance and
are disheartened by the eIIort oI  the worN we are doing,  I sometimes tell
them that the hXman race is in the midst  oI maNing an evolXtionary leap.
“:hether   or  not we sXcceed in that leap,” I say to them, “is yoXr personal
responsibility.” And  mine. The Xniverse, this stepping-stone, has been laid
down to prepare a way Ior Xs. BXt we oXrselves mXst step across it, one by
one. ThroXgh grace we are helped not  to  stXmble and throXgh grace we
Nnow that we are being welcomed. :hat more can we asN?

         AfterZord


         In the time since its  initial  pXblication, I have been IortXnate enoXgh
to receive many letters Irom readers oI The Road Less TraYeled. They have
been e[traordinary letters. Intelligent and articXlate withoXt e[ception, they
have also been e[tremely loving. As well  as e[pressing appreciation, most
oI them have contained additional  giIts:  appropriate poetry, XseIXl TXotes
Irom other  aXthors, nXggets oI wisdom and tales oI  personal e[perience.
These letters have enriched my liIe. It has become clear to me that there is a
whole networN—Iar   more  vast than  I  had dared to  believe—oI  people
across the coXntry who  have TXietly been proceeding Ior  long  distances
along the less traveled road oI spiritXal growth. They have thanNed me Ior
diminishing their  sense oI aloneness on the MoXrney. I thanN them Ior the
same service.
         A   Iew   readers  have   TXestioned my   Iaith   in   the   eIIicacy   oI
psychotherapy. I did  sXggest that  the TXality  oI  psychotherapists varies

252
widely. And I continXe to believe that most oI those who Iail to beneIit Irom
worN with a competent therapist do so becaXse they lacN the taste and will
Ior the rigors  oI that  worN. However I  did neglect to  speciIy that a small
minority oI  people—perhaps Iive percent—have psychiatric problems oI a
natXre that does not respond to psychotherapy and that may even be made
worse by the deep introspection involved.
         Anyone who has sXcceeded in thoroXghly reading and Xnderstanding
this booN is highly XnliNely to belong to that Iive percent. And in any case,
it is the responsibility  oI a competent therapist to careIXlly and sometimes
gradXally  discern   those  Iew   patients  who   shoXld   not   be  led   into
psychoanalytic worN  and  to  lead  them  instead toward  other  Iorms   oI
treatment that can be TXite beneIicial.
         BXt who is a competent psychotherapist? Several readers oI The Road
Less TraYeled who moved in the direction oI  seeNing psychotherapy have
written to  inTXire how  one shoXld go aboXt choosing the  right therapist,
distingXishing between the competent and the incompetent. My Iirst piece
oI advice  is to  taNe the choice serioXsly. It is  one oI  the most important
decisions yoX  can  maNe  in  yoXr   liIetime.   Psychotherapy is  a   maMor
investment, not only oI  yoXr money bXt even more oI  yoXr valXable time
and energy. It is what stocNbroNers woXld call a high-risN investment. II the
choice is right, it  will  pay oII  handsomely in spiritXal dividends yoX coXld
not even have dreamed oI. :hile it  is not liNely yoX will be actXally harmed
iI  yoX  maNe the wrong  choice,  yoX  will,   however, waste  most oI   the
valXable money, time and energy yoX have pXt into it.
         So don’t  hesitate to  shop aroXnd. And  don’t  hesitate to trXst  yoXr
Ieelings or  intXition.  UsXally  on  the basis oI   a single  interview  with   a
therapist, yoX will be able to picN Xp either good or bad “vibes.” II the vibes
are bad, pay yoXr  single Iee  and move on  to  another. SXch Ieelings are
XsXally intangible, bXt they may emanate Irom small tangible clXes. At the
time I entered therapy in 1966, I was very concerned and critical aboXt the
morality oI America’s involvement in the Vietnam :ar.   In his waiting room
my therapist had copies oI Ramparts and the NeZ  York ReYieZ of Books,
both liberal MoXrnals with antiwar editorial policies. I had begXn to picN Xp
good vibes beIore I had ever set eyes on him.
         BXt more important than yoXr therapist’s political leanings, age or se[
is whether he or she is a genXinely caring  person. This too yoX can oIten

253
sense TXicNly, althoXgh the therapist shoXld not Iall all over yoX with Nindly
reassXrances and snap commitments. II therapists are caring, they will also
be caXtioXs, disciplined and XsXally reserved, bXt it shoXld be possible Ior
yoX to intXit whether the reserve cloaNs warmth or coldness.
         Since therapists will  be interviewing  yoX  to see whether they want
yoX Ior a patient, it is wholly appropriate Ior yoX to be interviewing them in
retXrn. II  it   is  relevant to  yoX,  don’t  hold  bacN Irom  asNing what  the
therapist’s  Ieelings  are   aboXt sXch  issXes  as  women’s  liberation   or
homose[Xality or  religion.   YoX are entitled  to  honest, open and  careIXl
answers. In regard to other types oI TXestions—sXch as how long therapy
might last  or whether  yoXr sNin rash is  psychosomatic—yoX are XsXally
well·oII  to trXst a therapist who says that he or she does not Nnow. In Iact,
edXcated and sXccessIXl people in any proIession who admit ignorance are
generally the most e[pert and trXstworthy.
         A therapist’s ability bears very little  relationship to any credentials he
or she might  have. Love and coXrage and wisdom cannot be certiIied  by
academic  degrees.  For   instance,   “board-certiIied”    psychiatrists,   the
therapists with the most credentials, Xndergo sXIIiciently rigoroXs training
so that  one can be  relatively  certain  oI  not  Ialling  into  the  hands oI  a
charlatan. BXt a psychiatrist is not necessarily any better a therapist than a
psychologist, a social worNer or a minister or even as good. Indeed two oI
the very greatest therapists I Nnow have never even gradXated Irom college.
         :ord   oI moXth is oIten the best way to get started on yoXr search Ior
a psychotherapist. II   yoX have  some Iriend  yoX  respect who  has been
pleased with the services oI  a particXlar therapist, why  not begin on  that
recommendation? Another way, particXlarly advisable iI yoXr symptoms are
severe or yoX have physical diIIicXlties  as well,  woXld be to  start with  a
psychiatrist. By virtXe oI their medical training, psychiatrists are XsXally the
most  e[pensive  therapists,  bXt  they  are  also  in   the  best  position  to
Xnderstand all the angles oI yoXr sitXation. At the end oI the hoXr, aIter the
psychiatrist has had a chance to learn the dimensions oI yoXr problem, yoX
can asN. him or her to reIer yoX to a less e[pensive nonmedical therapist iI
appropriate. The best psychiatrists will XsXally be TXite willing  to tell yoX
which lay  practitioners  in  the commXnity are  particXlarly competent. OI
coXrse, iI the doctor gives yoX good vibes and is willing to taNe yoX on as a
patient, yoX can sticN with him or her.

254
         II   yoX  are  Iinancially   strapped and  have  no   medical  insXrance
coverage Ior oXtpatient psychotherapy, yoXr only  option  may be to  seeN
assistance at a government-  or  hospital-sXpported psychiatric or  mental
health clinic. There a Iee will  be set according to yoXr means, and yoX can
rest pretty well assXred that yoX will not Iall into  the hands oI a TXacN. On
the other hand, psychotherapy at clinics  has a tendency to be sXperIicial,
and yoXr  capacity to  choose yoXr  own  therapist may  be  TXite limited.
Nonetheless, it oIten worNs oXt very well.
         These brieI gXidelines have perhaps not been as speciIic as readers
might liNe. BXt the central message is that since psychotherapy reTXires an
intense and  psychologically   intimate  relationship  between  two   hXman
beings, nothing can relieve yoX oI the responsibility Ior personally choosing
the particXlar hXman being whom yoX can trXst to be yoXr gXide. The best
therapist Ior  one person  may not  be the  best Ior  another. Each  person,
therapist and patient, is  XniTXe, and yoX mXst rely  on yoXr  own XniTXe
intXitive MXdgment. BecaXse there is some risN involved, I wish yoX lXcN.
And becaXse the act oI entering psychotherapy with all that it involves is an
act oI coXrage, yoX have my admiration.

 Jonathan Swift : Gulliver's Travels

Introduction to Jonathan Swift and his age :
    Jonathan Swift was born of English parents in Dublin in 1667.
Unfortunately his father died before his birth and they had to depend
on the financial aid they received from relatives. After his schooling
and college, he worked as private secretary to Sir William Templeton
for several years. Illness caused him to return to Ireland, but due to
lack of work he came to his former post again. By 1699, Swift
composed some of his most famous satires like A Tale of the Tub and
The Battle of the Books, which were published only in 1704. His
Gulliver's Travels (written between 1721-1725) was published in
1726, and was a satire on the current politics between the Whigs and
the Tories. Though he wrote several works throughout the thirties, ill
health began to trouble him, and he took a turn for the worse until his
death on 19th October 1745. Swift's age was an age in which there
was an abundance of political controversies and ideological clashes,
particularly within the Church. Swift and his contemporaries, like
Pope, Steele and Addison, satirised prominent institutions as well as
political figures in their writings.


Summary of Gulliver's Travels
    Lemuel Gulliver was an educated seafaring man who wrote his
memoirs of four voyages to remote countries of the world with the
intention of contributing to human knowledge. These are described in
the four books which make up Gulliver's Travels. In Book I, which
describes his first voyage to Lilliput, Gulliver is shipwrecked on an
unknown island near Sumatra and wakes to find himself the captive of
a race of people six inches tall. They are afraid when he moves his
head and when he shouts, and attack him with arrows and spears, but
stop when he is quiet. Gulliver makes a sign that he is hungry and
thirsty, and hundreds of men feed him with buckets of meat and water.

The Emperor of Lilliput is impressed by Gulliver's good behaviour.
Gulliver meets the people of Blefuscu, the rivals of Lilliput, and after
a series of adventures, returns home.
  In Book II, Gulliver is accidentally abandoned by his shipmates in a
place where the inhabitants are twelve times his size. They keep him
as a pet and regard him as a freak of nature. The scale used in Book I
is reversed. The Lilliputians had been hostile to Gulliver on his
arrival, but here he is treated with kindness by the giants.
   In Book III, Gulliver is captured by pirates and left to his fate near
some small islands. He is taken aboard the flying island of Laputa,
inhabited by people who are obsessed by abstract sciences, and who
tyrannize the land of Balnibarbi. From Balnibarbi, Gulliver makes a
trip to Glubbdrubdrib, the island of Sorcerers. He then goes to
Luggnagg, where he meets the race of Struldbrugs, who are fated to
everlasting senility.
  In Book IV he is the Captain of a ship and becomes the victim of a
mutiny. He is abandoned on a shore and meets a noble race of horses,
the Houyhnhnms. He also meets the Yahoos, and despite their human
shape, finds them the most disagreeable creatures he has ever met. By
contrast, the Houyhnhnms appear to be perfect creatures and Gulliver
comes to love their way of life. They are dignified and philosophical,
and quite unlike the absurd and spiteful Lilliputians, the grotesque
Brobdignagians, and the intellectual freaks of Book III. But the
Houyhnhnms regard Gulliver as a kind of Yahoo, a view which he is
forced to agree. Exiled from their land, Gulliver is forced to return to
England, where he divides his time between talking to his horses and
attempting to reform the people in his kingdom.

                        1.1 Introduction
   Lemuel Gulliver was a young man who had studied and practised
medicine, but had not been successful as a medical practitioner. He
sets off on a voyage to the East Indies, but the ship is wrecked in a
storm. Gulliver swims to an island, and overcome by the ordeal, falls
asleep on the shore. Next morning, when he tries to rise, he is unable
to do so as his whole body is tied to pegs by strings. He feels
something moving on his left leg and come up almost to his chin. He
raises his head as far as he can, and is surprised to find a human
creature only six inches high with a bow and arrow in his hands. Then
forty more of the same size follow. Gulliver roars so loud that they
jump to the ground out of fear. As he struggles, he is able to free his
left arm. Gulliver gives a tug at the strings and feels more free. A

                               Jonathan Swift : Gulliver's Travels / 3
hundred arrows are shot on his body and he groans in pain. But the
arrows stop when he is quiet. A stage of about a foot and a half from
the ground with ladders to mount it is made. Four men stand on it, and
one of them makes a long speech which he does not understand. His
strings are cut and Gulliver makes signs to indicate that he is hungry
and thirsty. Several ladders are put against his sides and buckets of
meat and water are put into his mouth. Hundreds of carpenters and
engineers make a wooden frame, and Gulliver is raised in his sleep on
this and wheeled into the metropolis where he is confined in a temple.
The emperor of Lilliput is taller and more handsome than other
courtiers, and becomes a great admirer of Gulliver. He is impressed
by Gulliver's kindness, and appoints a team of learned men to teach
Gulliver their language. Gulliver applies many times for liberty. At last,
the emperor discusses the matter with his cabinet, and it is decided
that he will be released on certain conditions. Some days after his
release, Gulliver comes to know about the enemity between Lilliput
and the empire of Blefuscu, situated on an island on the north-east of
Lilliput, and decides to pay a visit there. In the meantime, a conspiracy
against him is hatched in Lilliput, and some courtiers want him to be
given the death sentence, while the emperor wants him to be excused.
Ultimately, Gulliver manages to leave Lilliput and goes to Blefuscu.
The emperor of Lilliput sends a letter to the emperor of Blefuscu,
saying that Gulliver should be sent back to them. Gulliver decides to
depart early as he does not want to become a bone of contention
between them. So he sets out to sea and sees an English ship which
takes him to England.
  After two months stay at home, Gulliver sets out on a voyage again
on a ship which is bound for India, but a storm drives them on the
shore of an island. The captain sends many of them in search of water.
When Gulliver returns, he finds his companions in the boat which
moves off. He is left alone in Brobdingnag, where people are sixty-foot
high. He is like a doll among the giants and the rest is adjusted to the
same scale. Unlike the Lilliputians, who were hostile to Gulliver, the
giants are kind to Gulliver. But they regard him as a freak of nature and
he is continuously put on display, so much so that he falls sick. Gulliver
personally wins the favour of the King and the Queen and travels with
them to the sea-shore in a box. Gulliver's box is carried away by a
giant eagle and dropped in the sea where he is rescued by some


                English Fiction / 4
English sailors and brought to England.
    Gulliver then set out on a voyage, but the ship was attacked by
pirates. They put Gulliver on a canoe with provisions for a few days.
After five days, Gulliver sees a flying island which is lowered for him.
Gulliver is drawn up by means of a pulley. The flying island is called
Laputa. They are a strange set of people with their heads cocked on
one side and one eye turned inward and the other towards the zenith.
The Laputans keep an island under complete subjugation. If the
people over there rebel, either stones are dropped on them or the
island is lowered to crush them to death. The Laputans are all the time
absorbed in thought and are interested in mathematics. But when
Gulliver's clothes are prepared after taking his scientific
measurements' they hang loose on his body because the tailor makes
a mistake in calculation. The professors are engaged in useless,
impractical experiments like extracting sunlight from cucumber.
Gulliver visits the island of Luggnagg, which is inhabited by people
who are immortal, but he is disappointed when he comes to know that
they suffer from old age infirmities, and lie in a helpless and hopeless
condition. Gulliver finds his way to a Dutch ship which brings him
home.
   After some time, Gulliver is offered captaincy of a ship and recruits
seamen who are really pirates. They put him on a boat and leave him
to the mercy of the wind and the sea. He reaches an island which is
inhabited by noble horsemen or the Houyhnhnms, and their servants,
the Yahoos who have human form. The Houyhnhnms are very rational
while the Yahoos are disturbed by irrational passions. The legislative
assembly of the Houyhnhnms declares that Gulliver is a Yahoo and
therefore he should live with the Yahoos or go back. Reluctantly,
Gulliver boards a Portugese ship to return but cannot get over his
hatred of the Yahoos and mankind and prefers horses to men.



                1.2 The character of Gulliver
   Gulliver is the protagonist, the figure around whom the action
revolves in the novel. He is not only the main character but also a
clever device used by Swift for various purposes. Gulliver is the polite
and well-mannered gentleman who innocently and impartially narrates
all that he sees and experiences. So the reader accepts his point of


                              Jonathan Swift : Gulliver's Travels / 5
view unquestioningly, and this becomes the cause of most of the
confusion, particularly because Gulliver's shortcomings always involve
him in absurdities. Swift often makes Gulliver give a superficial view of
things, like the political games in the Lilliputian court. He often uses
Gulliver to criticize or to make a moral judgement, while claiming that
he writes without passion or prejudice. The fact is that Gulliver is a
good observer incapable of seeing what matters most, and is literal-
minded, totally unimaginative and humourless. This is why Gulliver at
once sees everything and sees nothing. He sees only two extremes,
and so is prone to easy judgements and false moral conclusions.

              1.3 Analysis of Gulliver's Travels
1.3.1       Book I
  The beginning of the first book presents Gulliver as a fictional
character with his family background, education and marriage.
Gulliver's escape to an island where men are only six inches high
suggests a realistic account of a real voyage and the symbolic
significance of the voyage is also obvious. The physical size of the
people in Lilliput is the measure of their intellectual and moral size.
Thus, Swift symbolically shows the smallness of man. Lilliput is
England and Blefuscu is France. The dispute between Lilliput and
Blefuscu represents the dispute between England and France. This
chapter contains veiled references to contemporary events and
figures of the time as well as the smallness and pettiness of man.
Gulliver's voyage to Lilliput is full of topical allusions to contemporary
England. But they are transmuted into the symbolic and allegorical
caricature of the institutions of mankind and provide a mirror to man
all his smallness, pettiness and hypocrisy.




                 English Fiction / 6
1.3.2 Book II
     While he had been among tiny people in Lilliput, Gulliver is tiny
himself in Brobdingnag, where the inhabitants are sixty feet tall giants
and the rest is adjusted to the same scale. In Brobdingnag, the human
reality reveals itself as ridiculous and infinitely small. Whereas the
Lilliputians were hostile to Gulliver on his arrival, he is treated kindly
by the giants. Swift applies the focus of relativity to the two strange
worlds where the physical size of the inhabitants represents their
intellectual and moral size. Now all the loves, hates, prides, wars are
as petty and trivial as man himself. When Gulliver gives him an
account of the political, administrative and judicial system operating in
England, the king points out possibilities of corruption and injustice in
it. It is seen that the giants of Brobdingng are intellectual and moral
giants while the world of Gulliver is a world of moral and intellectual
pygmies.


1.3.3 Book III
     In this book, Gulliver introduces the reader to another marvel, a
flying island, which is a product of scientific ingenuity. He is astonished
at the appearance and habits of the people, eg. that their heads are
inclined either to the right or to the left, or that they cut bread into
cones, parallelograms or other mathematical figures. Theirs is a
scientific world, which is dominated by science and there is no place
for imagination or fancy. he book brings to light the indifference of the
Laputans to the practical matters of life and complete absorption in
scientific and philosophical speculation. Some critics say that the
flying island stands for England and the country below is Ireland. The
way the king treats the people below represents the treatment of
Ireland by the English politicians. Swift satirises the Royal Society with
its projects of scientific investigation, and criticises every kind of
impractical scholarship and vain philosophy. He expresses his
extreme bitterness against politicians who are self-centered and
impose taxes on the people for their personal gains. Gulliver's visit to
Luggnagg in this chapter is a satire on the way the king treats his
subjects by stripping them of their human dignity (eg. Gulliver crawls
on his belly and licks the floor when he meets the king). Swift also
comments on man's desire for immortality when he indicates that he
is disillusioned with immortality to see the immortal humans suffering

                               Jonathan Swift : Gulliver's Travels / 7
from the infirmities of old age and cursing their fate because they
cannot get out of it. The circumstantial details in this book give an air
of realism to Gulliver's account of the voyage.


1.3.4     Book IV
  In the land of the Houyhnhyms, Gulliver enters a new world where
he encounters strange kinds of animals. The hairy animals have a
human form and attack Gulliver for no reason. The horses or
Houyhnhnms are amazingly rational and intelligent. As soon as they
appear, the animals in the human form or the Yahoos who are
attacking Gulliver , move away from him. Gulliver's description of the
Yahoos is a highly effective device of satire to show how ridiculous
humans are. Swift comments on human beings through the contrast
between the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The horses are clean and
their diet is balanced and vegetarian. Though the Yahoos are human
in form and features, they are filthy and stink and eat rotten meat and
garbage. The physical similarity between Yahoos and human beings
shocks and horrifies Gulliver. The inferiority of the Yahoos to the
Houyhnhnms reflects that man is inferior to a horse.
The unity of the novel, or structure, can be seen in the voyages and in
their parallels and contrasts. Each voyage is an adventure preceded
by an accident. Thus,.he lands on the shore of Lilliput because his
ship splits on a rock, is left on the shores of Brobdingnag by his mates,
is set adrift in a canoe by pirates and reaches Laputa, and a mutinous
crew leave him on the deserted shore of Houyhnhnmland. The four
books are linked by contrast. eg. the inhabitants of Lilliput are six
inches tall, while the Brobdingnagians are sixty-foot giants. Above all,
the central theme of the novel is absurd pride of man and the four
books are united by this theme. The tiny size of the Lilliputians
represents their moral and intellectual size, while the great height of
the giants represents their moral and intellectual height. The book
about Laputa gives numerous examples of how man misuses his
intelligence and reasoning powers. The fourth book makes the final
comment that even horses are superior to men who are physically
repulsive and morally corrupt creatures.

         1.4 Irony and Satire in Gulliver's Travels
   Irony is a technical literary term which implies a contrast between
appearance and reality or saying one thing while meaning another.
Jonathan Swift is the master of irony, both verbal irony and the irony
of situation and it is an essential and integral part of his outlook on life
embodied in his works of art. In Gulliver's Travels irony is fused with
allegory. In his first voyage Gulliver finds himself in Lilliput which is
inhabited by people who are six inches tall. The verbal irony lies in the
contrast of the size of the Emperor and the high sounding majestic
adjectives used for him. The physical size of the Lilliputians represent
their moral and intellectual size as they indulge in their malice,
conspiracy, hypocrisy and ingratitude. They are like toys or dolls to
Gulliver. But the little doll-like men act exactly as the full-size men do.
They are a reflection of the English people as well as mankind. He
calls the Lilliputians "small men" as they are not only physically small
but their size represents their moral size. Gulliver's voyage to Lilliput
is full of topical allusions to contemporary England., but they are
transmuted into the symbolic allegorical caricature of the institutions of
mankind and provides a mirror to man with all his smallness and
pettiness. The voyage to Brobdingnag presents a contrast not only
between the physical size of Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians but also
their moral and spiritual size. The Brobdingnagians are just the
reverse of what the Lilliputians were. In sharp contrast with the
malicious, hypocritical, ungrateful attitude of the Lilliputians, the
Brobdingnagians are magnanimous. Swift concentrates on the
superiority of the giants and the insignificance of Gulliver. While the
Lilliputians attacked Gulliver with spears and arrows at first sight, the


                                Jonathan Swift : Gulliver's Travels / 9
Brobdingnagians take care of him and are amused at the sight of the
toy-like man in the form of Gulliver. When Gulliver tells the king about
arms and ammunition which can destroy houses and cities in no time,
he is struck with horror that such a tiny creature could entertain ideas
of blood and destruction. The king forbids him to mention such
obnoxious things again in his presence. The moral superiority and the
intellectual clarity of the king of Brobdingnag is far greater than that of
Gulliver. Gulliver's pride is a common failing of man which needs to be
humbled. The king rightly observes that the history of Gulliver's
country is one of frauds and deceits. The voyage to Laputa has an
ironic framework. Here men are engaged in strange scientific and
philosophical speculations and experiments like extracting sunbeams
out of cucumber. They are more interested in hypothetical
speculations than facts, and as a result, the practical side of their life
is clumsy and neglected. Here Swift reflects the opinion of the
contemporary wits and scholars who found much of the work of the
Royal Society intellectually contemptible. The voyage to the land of
the Houhyhnhnms is the climax of the book. The land is populated by
horses who are perfectly reasonable and Yahoos who are human
beings in their irrationality. Swift has adopted the technique of reversal
in this book. The horses or the Houyhnhnms are noble and lead life
according tolaws of reason and nature., while the Yahoos, human in
form, are filthy brutes.The irony is again emphasised when at the time
of his departure, Gulliver feels the pangs of parting, while the
Houyhnhnmns are completely unmoved by it. Swift manipulates the
three elements, Gulliver, the Houyhnhnm and the Yahoo for his satiric
effects. Gulliver finds savages (horses) noble and Yahoos savage.
Gulliver's Travels is a satire on the English as well as on mankind. It
is a satire on the politics and administration of England, as well as the
smallness of man, his vanity, illusions, rivalries, malice and hypocrisy.
Gulliver himself is Swift's most important device of irony. His narration
is apparently innocent of malice, and his manner is polite and
agreeable. These are the cause of the reader's confusion because he
is caught unawares.

    Write one word for the following : -

b) The race which studies philosophy in the novel              ---------------



                          1.5 Conclusion
   Gulliver's Travels was written as a satire on politics in
contemporary England as well as satire on mankind in general. His
tone is often harsh and bitter, particularly when he wants to criticize
the policies during his time. Henry Fielding wrote Joseph Andrews
about twenty years later. This was also satirical in tone, but quite
different from Gulliver's Travels. Though both used the journey as the
medium, Swift's barbs are directed towards contemporary politics
while Fielding criticises contemporary society. Though both critcise
man, Swift is harsh and bitter, while Fielding is light-hearted and
indulgent. These similarities and differences will be seen better when
we study Joseph Andrews in the next chapter.


                            1.6 Summary
   At the beginning of this chapter, we have seen that Jonathan
Swift's Gulliver's Travels was written in an age when there was an
abundance of political controversies and ideological clashes,
particularly within the Church. This novel was aimed at satirising the
institutions, political figures as well as the ideas and the policies of the
times. In the Introduction, we got a brief idea of the plot of the novel,
which is divided into four books, each giving an account of a voyage
experienced by a sailor, Lemuel Gulliver, when he visited a strange
and unknown land. Thus, in Book I, we read an account of his
experience when he visited Lilliput, a land inhabited by people who are
six inches tall. In Book II, Swift describes Gulliver's voyage to
Brobdingnag, the land of giants. Book III describes Gulliver's strange
experience in Laputa, where the people are preoccupied with scientific
experiments but seem to be quite irrational. In Book IV, Swift describes
Gulliver's voyage to a strange land where he meets a noble race of


                               Jonathan Swift : Gulliver's Travels / 11
horses, the Houyhnhnms, and the disgusting Yahoos, who resemble
human beings.
  We then made a brief study of the character of Gulliver, who is
cleverly used as a satirical device by Swift. As a narrator, Gulliver is
polite, observant, but literal-minded and humourless. Thus, he is
prone to easy judgements and false moral conclusions, and the reader
is also often misled.
  The next chapter consisted of a detailed analysis of the four books
that make up the novel. In Book I, Gulliver in Lilliput comes across a
people who are six inches tall and their emperor tall just by the breadth
of a nail. Their physical size represents their moral and intellectual
size. They are the worst embodiments of pride, pettiness, malice,
cruelty, and ingratitude. In Book II, Gulliver goes to Brobdingnag,
where the inhabitants are ten times his size. Their physical height
represents their moral and intellectual height. They are generous,
hospitable, and thus, the reverse of Lilliputians. Book III describes
Gulliver's adventures in Laputa, inhabited by people who are
obsessed by abstract sciences and speculations. Their houses are
clumsy and their fields are wastelands. It is a satire on the useless
application to futile projects by the scientists of the day. Book IV,
describes the voyage to the land of the Houyhnhnms, and in it, Swift
has a surprise in store for the reader. Gulliver sees horses, the
Houyhnhnms and Yahoos, the men-like creatures who serve them.
What is surprising is that the horses are rational and noble, while the
Yahoos are repulsive and beastly.
  In the next part of the chapter, we saw the way in which Swift has
made use of irony and satire in the novel. Irony means saying one
thing while meaning another. Gulliver's voyages to Lilliput,
Brobdingnag, Laputa and Houyhnhnmland are means of presenting
strange worlds and revealing ironically the evils of the familiar world.

  Henry Fielding : Joseph Andrews

Introduction to Henry Fielding
     Henry Fielding was born in on 22 April 1707, in a landowning
family in Somerset, England. He was educated at Eton and later went
to the University of Leyden, in the Netherlands. In 1729 he left Leyden
to go to London where he began a career as a professional dramatist.
During the early part of the 18th century, Fielding wrote many plays
which satirized the leading politicians and public figures of the day,
including Hugh Walpole, King George II and the Queen. This resulted
in the censoring of the stage and the closure of Fielding's own theatre.
He had to find other means of livelihood and soon became a novelist.
    In 1740, Samuel Richardson's novel Pamela or Virtue Rewarded
was published and immediately became a sensation. Richardson's
story of a virtuous servant girl protecting her chastity against her
wealthy employer, which resulted in her triumph over him and their
marriage, was highly praised as an example of moral purity. Several
writers wrote burlesques and parodies of Pamela. Fielding felt that
Richardson's novel was clumsy, pretentious and absurd. In 1741, he
wrote a parody, An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews,
which treated the chastity of Richardson's heroine as dishonest and
hypocritical, having little to do with goodness of heart or spirit.
    In 1742, Fielding published The History of the Adventures of
Joseph Andrews. And of his Friend Mr. Abraham Adams. Written in
Imitation of the Manner of Cervantes. Author of Don Quixote, to
ridicule Pamela. He reversed the situation in Richardson's novel by
presenting Joseph the chaste servant (instead of the innocent and
virtuous serving - maid), whom Lady Booby tempts from the path of
virtue, and who runs away to save his chastity. At this moment in the
story, Fielding became so engrossed in the narrative that Richardson
was almost forgotten, and described a series of adventures on the
road, where Joseph is accompanied by Parson Adams. Joseph
Andrews was followed by The History of Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great,

                              Henry Fielding : Joseph Andrews / 15
in 1743, a satiric novel which alluded to Sir Robert Walpole.
Fielding's belief that generosity frequently exists in those whom
society condemns, intensified, as is seen in his next novel, Tom Jones,
published in 1749, which has as its theme the life and adventures of
Tom Jones and is a profound portrait of what Fielding considered a
complete man. His last novel, Amelia, published in 1751, does not
have the balance of his preceding novel, and was not very successful.
The only major English novels before Joseph Andrews were Defoe's
Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders and Richardson's Pamela. But
with Fielding the novel had come of age. He endowed it with form and
gave it middle - class realism and used characters and places that
existed and represented real life.


Summary of Joseph Andrews
   Joseph Andrews consists of a preface followed by four books divided
into sixty-four chapters. Each chapter is prefaced by a short, often
humorous summary. In the preface to the novel, Fielding calls it a
comic romance, a comic epic poem in prose. He also says that the
novel is not a burlesque, as the characters are based on those found
in real life. Fielding begins Book I by talking about the moral purpose
of actual examples, and declares that the reader is improved by a
mixture & of instruction and entertainment. He says that Joseph
Andrews is the brother of Pamela and has kept in mind the pattern of
his sister's virtues, thus being a good example of "male - chastity".
Fielding talks about Joseph as if he were a great hero. By the time he
was ten and could read and write, Joseph was apprenticed to Sir
Thomas Booby. He took care of dogs and horses, and was moved from
working in the fields to the stables because he had an excellent voice.
At the age of seventeen he caught the eye of Lady Booby who wanted
him as her personal servant. Fielding then tells us about Parson
Abraham Adams, an excellent scholar, good - natured. but ignorant of
the ways of the world. Simplicity is the hallmark of his character, and
he is a good parson but earns a small income which is not enough to
live well with his wife and six children. He is surprised at Joseph's
knowledge of the New Testament. Mrs. Slipslop, "the waiting -
gentlewoman" likes to use jargon, which she often does not
understand, and wants Parson Adams to accept her superior
knowledge of theology. Lady Booby wants to go to London and take

               English Fiction / 16
Joseph with her. In London Joseph follows the fashions, but avoids
gambling, drinking and other vices. Lady Booby now finds him
attractive, and tries to tempt him by holding hands with him, leering
at him, and having him bring messages to her room. Joseph remains
chaste, but London gossip suggests that he has become her lover.
When Sir Thomas Booby dies, she pretends to mourn, but in fact plays
cards with her friends for six days. On the seventh day she attempts to
seduce Joseph. When Joseph does not respond, she says that he is
either a fool or pretends to be, so as to avoid what she is offering, and
orders him out of the room. Joseph writes to his sister Pamela
complaining about Lady Booby's behaviour and expressing a wish to
look for another job as London appears to be a bad place. Then
Joseph is approached by Mrs. Slipslop, who also desires him. An ugly
old woman, Mrs. Slipslop has been without a lover for so long that she
is no longer afraid of ruining her reputation. But Joseph offers her
respect and she feels insulted. Lady Booby calls Mrs. Slipslop to her
room and the two disappointed women talk about Joseph. Mrs.
Slipslop says that he is a drunkard, gambler and a rascal who has
made a chambermaid pregnant. Lady Booby tells her to dismiss
Joseph and the maid, and asks her to send Joseph to see her
immediately. She then talks to him about his supposed misbehavior
with the maids in the house, and implies that he will be excused if he
kisses her and may also take other liberties. Joseph says that he hopes
to remain virtuous and follow his sister Pamela's example. Lady
Booby orders him out of the house and summons Mrs. Slipslop to tell
her about her decision. Mrs. Slipslop mocks her and Lady Booby
wonders if she should dismiss her because Joseph may have told her
about Lady Booby's passion for him. But she decides not to dismiss
Mrs. Slipslop, who, in turn, decides to continue working in her house.
Joseph writes a letter to Pamela, telling her about Lady Booby's
passion for him and resolving to imitate her chastity. He receives his
wages from Peter : Pounce, the steward (who lends money at very
high rates), and leaves the house. Joseph leaves London and towards
Lady Booby's house in the country because in that parish lives Fanny,
a beautiful but poor girl, he loves. She has been brought up by Sir
Thomas's family and they have not married because Parson Adams
advised them to wait until they had sufficient money and experience to
live comfortably.

  During his journey, Joseph is at first offered the use of a horse by
another traveler, but later continues alone on foot. He is attacked and
beaten unconscious by two thieves who take his clothes and money.
After a time a stage - coach passes by. The passengers do not want to
stop to help because some are afraid that they will also be robbed,
some object that Joseph is naked, and some say that if he dies they will
have more trouble. None of the rich passengers will lend him clothing,
but the postillion gives him his own coat so that he can enter the
coach. The coach moves on and is also robbed. They reach an inn
where Betty, the maid, provides a shirt and a bed for Joseph, while Mr.
Tow-wouse, the owner of the inn, and his wife, argue over the charity
Betty has shown. A stranger enters the inn, and turns out to be Parson
Adams. One of the thieves is caught and Joseph's clothing and a gold"
coin belonging to him are also found. The thief is to be taken before a
justice of the peace the next day, but is left unguarded and escapes
during the night. Parson Adams is on his way to London to sell his
sermons, and Barnabas, the local clergyman, introduces a bookseller
to him. The bookseller tells Adams that the trade is overstocked with
sermons. Betty falls in love with Joseph but is rejected and in anger,
allows herself to be taken to bed by the landlord, whose wife discovers
them and dismisses Betty from employment.
   Fielding opens Book II by giving reasons for dividing a work of
literature into books and chapters. Adams leaves the inn to sell his
sermons in London, but accidentally leaves them behind. He takes this
as a sign that he should return to the parish, and decides to
accompany Joseph who is going to meet Fanny. With one horse
between them, Joseph and Adams take turns to ride and walk. The
rider, after a distance, will tie the horse to a tree and proceed on foot
until the other catches up with him. Adams goes ahead and waits for
Joseph at an alehouse where Mrs. Slipslop arrives in a stage-coach.
Apparently, she met Joseph when he was detained for the debt of the
horse and paid for it. Joseph keeps the horse, while Adams rides in the
coach with Mrs. Slipslop and they travel towards an inn. On the way,
Joseph is thrown from the horse and gets a sore le.g. The innkeeper's
wife tends to his leg instead of preparing food for the coach
passengers and is scolded by her husband. There is a quarrel in which
Adams and Mrs. Slipslop join in.



               English Fiction / 18
    The journey continues and Joseph sees Adams walking ahead. The
absent-minded parson forgot his horse and left it at the inn. They try
to catch up with Adams but he walks so fast that he out distances the
coach and takes a wrong turning. As he continues, it becomes dark,
and hearing the sound of a woman shrieking, Adams goes to her
rescue. He fights with the ravisher and knocks him unconscious.
Several young men appear and as Adams is telling them what
happened, the man regains consciousness and accuses Adams and the
woman of attempting to murder him. The young men decide to hand
over Adams and the woman to the justice of the peace. Adams realizes
that the woman he rescued is Fanny, Joseph's beloved. The justice is
about to send them to prison, when someone recognizes Adams and
has him released, while the real criminal escapes. Fanny and Adams
meet someone who knows where Joseph is, and they go in search of
him. They stop at an alehouse because of a storm, and meet Joseph,
as well as Mrs. Slipslop. She refuses to acknowledge Fanny, though
she has lived in the same house for many years, and departs angrily
in the coach. They wake Adams and request him to wed them
immediately, but he insists that they follow the church regulations and
wait until their intentions have been publicly announced three times.
As they do not have money to pay for the bill, Adams decides to
borrow money from a local parson, named Trulliber, who takes a
dislike to him because of his poor appearance, insults him, and will
give him nothing. As the hostess refuses to let them go without paying
the bill, and no rich person in the neighbourhood will lend them
money, they cannot leave, but a poor pedlar comes to their rescue by
lending them all he has.
    Book III begins with praise of biography and how good literature
is based on real people and has the object of correcting behaviour.
Fielding says that Joseph, Fanny, and Adams leave the inn, and in the
course of a dark, starless night, reach a house where they are offered
refreshment. Mr. Wilson, the owner, tells the story of his life and he and
Adams sit up all night drinking and talking. He tells Adams how he
had spent his fortune, married the daughter of the man who had
swindled him, and that their eldest son had been stolen by some
gypsies and never been found. Wilson says that he will be able to
recognize his son by a strawberry mark on his left breast. As they
observe the Wilson household, they conclude that it is an ideal one.

Having rested, the trio resume their journey. A pack of hounds attack
them and they beat them off with sticks. A squire, the owner of the
pack, arrives and demands that they should not be beaten. He then
invites them for dinner to his house, but once they arrive, Joseph and
Fanny are sent to eat in the kitchen, while Adams eats with his host.
The servants are told to make Joseph and Fanny drunk as the squire
intends to rape Fanny. But Adams and Joseph leave the house using
their sticks to protect Fanny whom the servants attempt to detain. They
reach an inn and in the morning, the squire's servants come and fight
with them. Fanny is carried off and Adams and Joseph are beaten up
and tied to the bed-posts. Some men, armed with pistols rescue her,
and one of them is Peter Pounce, Lady Booby's steward. The chariot,
with Fanny and Peter, proceeds to the inn where Adams and Joseph
are bound. They find Adams's horse and go to Booby Hall.
  In Book IV, Fielding tells us that Lady Booby still dreams of Joseph
and makes various excuses for his not loving her. She decides to retire
into the country. On her way to Booby Hall, she is surprised to see
Joseph. Parson Adams takes Fanny and Joseph to his house. On
Sunday Lady Booby is at church when Parson Adams announces the
coming marriage of Joseph Andrews and Fanny Goodwill. When Lady
Booby returns home, she summons Parson Adams. Lady Booby
threatens Parson Adams for befriending Joseph when she has
dismissed him from her employment. She commands Adams not to
publish the banns again, and thus not allow Joseph and Fanny to have
a church marriage. Adams refuses to obey her so Lady Booby sends
for Lawyer Scout and tells him to have both Joseph and Fanny
removed from the parish. He says that he will have Justice Frolick
commit them to prison in London. Two days later Lady Booby hears
Parson Adams publish the banns again at church. Returning home she
meets Slipslop who informs her that Joseph and Fanny have been
taken as criminals before Justice Frolick. Slipslop is upset and cries
that Joseph will be hanged! Lady Booby wants Fanny removed from
the parish but Joseph to remain. While she puzzles on what to do next,
a servant announces that her nephew, Mr. Booby, and his wife have
arrived in a coach. This is the first Lady Booby has heard of her
nephew's marriage. She is introduced to his wife, Pamela, who is the
sister of Joseph. As soon as Mr. Booby learns from his servants that
Joseph is committed to trial he visits the judge so that his wife's


               English Fiction / 20
brother may be freed and Pamela and Joseph reunited. When he
arrives the judge is in the process of sending Joseph and Fanny to
prison in London. He goes to Lady Booby's house and tells her that
Joseph is now his brother-in-law and requests that he admitted to their
circle and treated as a gentleman. Lady Booby, secretly still in love
with Joseph, immediately agrees but as soon as her nephew mentions
Fanny, she becomes angry. The squire returns to Joseph and tells him
that he must stay with his sister Pamela, while Fanny returns to
Parson Adam's house. Parson Adams agrees that Joseph and Fanny
can marry on Monday. Mrs. Adams attempts to persuade her husband
not to publish the marriage banns as it would make Lady Booby angry.
Joseph and Fanny enter. Adams tells Joseph that he should have
patience and wait to marry Fanny in church. He then lectures him
concerning the need to accept the ways of Divine Providence.
Someone enters and tells the parson that his youngest son has
drowned. Adams acts with all the passion and lack of resignation of
which he accused Joseph. The son, however, is alive; he fell into a
river and was saved by a pedlar.
    Lady Booby decides to bring Fanny and Beau Didapper together
in the hope that his fine appearance will win the girl's love and make
her abandon Joseph. Lady Booby and Beau Didapper visit Parson
Adams. He is short, misshapen, effeminate and self-satisfied. Beau
Didapper makes advances toward Fanny. Joseph, angered, hits him.
Mr. and Mrs. Booby disapprove of Joseph's defending Fanny and of
his wish to marry a girl of her class. Haughty Pamela also scolds him
for this. A pedlar tells Fanny that he knows of her parents. A woman
he once lived with confessed before she died that years ago she
traveled with some gypsies who kidnapped a young girl from the
Andrews family and sold her to a Sir Thomas Booby as servant.
Fanny, hearing the story, faints. It appears that Joseph is her brother
and Pamela is her sister! Parson Adams gives thanks that the secret
has been discovered before incest is committed by Joseph and Fanny.
Slipslop tells Lady Booby that a strange pedlar claims that Fanny and
Joseph are sister and brother. Everyone then gathers at Booby Hall to
hear the pedlar's story. Mr. Booby says that Mr. Andrews and his wife
will arrive the next morning and will confirm or disprove the story.
    Beau Didapper plans to slip into Fanny's bed at night by
pretending to be Joseph. He mistakenly enters into Slipslop's room.


                             Henry Fielding : Joseph Andrews / 21
Her cries of alarm bring a naked Parson Adams to the rescue. In the
dark he mistakes Slipslop for a man and they fight while Beau
Didapper escapes. Lady Booby finds them and assumes the naked
person is attacking Slipslop. She sees the fine clothes the Beau has left,
and the situation is explained. Adams starts back to his bedroom, but
takes the wrong turn, enters Fanny's room and, naked, falls asleep
unknowingly alongside her. When Joseph enters, the parson awakens
believing that witchcraft has taken place. At first angry, Joseph knows
the parson's eccentricities and understands there has been a mistake.
Mr. and Mrs. Andrews arrive. Mrs. Andrews claims Fanny as her
daughter. Mr. Andrews went abroad while his wife was pregnant. She
gave birth to a daughter who was stolen by gypsies, who left behind a
boy. The boy is Joseph, whom Mrs. Andrews raised as her own child.
The pedlar claims that Joseph was the child of a gentleman, Mr.
Wilson. Joseph was stolen by gypsies who later, when he was ill, left
him with Mrs. Andrews when they stole Fanny. Mr. Wilson arrives and
hearing the story identifies Joseph from a strawberry mark on his
breast. Joseph obtains his father's permission to marry Fanny. They
are wedded by Parson Adams in church. Mr. Booby gives Fanny two
thousand pounds which she and Joseph use to purchase an estate. Mr.
Booby offers Mr. Adams a position with a better income. Adams
refuses to quit his parishioners, but then decides to accept the offer
because with the additional money he can hire another curate to help
him to look after both parishes.

                          2.1    Introduction
     Joseph Andrews was originally written to ridicule Richardson's
Pamela. Fielding contrived this satire by reversing the situation in
Richardson's novel. Instead of the virtuous serving-maid Pamela,
Fielding presents Joseph, the chaste servant, whom Lady Booby tries
to tempt from the path of virtue, and who runs away to save his
chastity. The series of adventures in which Joseph is accompanied by
Parson Adams that Fielding describes, are admirably depicted, and
make an absorbing narrative.

        2.2    Characterisation in Joseph Andrews

2.2.1 Parson Adams
  Joseph Andrews is a panoramic novel, and the reader is introduced
to the world of the eighteenth century, from the highest to the lowest
social planes. Every new page introduces a new character as the
novel moves from the Booby parish to London and back again. All the
characters, no matter how small their appearance, are vital, and serve
to complement the progress of the main action and the principal
characters. Fielding's experience in the field of drama helped him to
delineate the characters as also to dramatize the action. The novel
essentially revolves around five characters: Parson Adams, Joseph
Andrews, Fanny Goodwill, Mrs. Slipslop, and Lady Booby.
  Parson Abraham Adams is undoubtedly the character whose
fortunes the reader follows with the most interest. He is a bundle of
contradictions, a delightful mixture of scholarship and simplicity, and
pedantry and credulity. He is a scholar with a perfect knowledge of
Greek and Latin and of such modern and European languages as
French and Italian. He often uses Latin expressions, and during the
novel he journeys with a manuscript of Aeschylus's plays in Greek. He
gives irreproachable advice to Joseph about fortitude and resignation,
but he is overwhelmed with grief when his child is reported to be
drowned. When he speaks on discipline, marriage, or faith, he is very
sensible, but he is deceived by every rogue he meets, and believes in
the principles of Peter Pounce and the humanity of Parson Trulliber.
Brave, friendly and without malice or envy, he is a man of good sense
and good nature, but ignorant of the ways of this world. He is about
fifty years old and has a wife and six children whom he can barely
support on his very small income as a curate. Adams enjoys drinking
beer. He considers all his parishioners, especially Joseph and Fanny,
as his children. He is eccentric and forgetful; he often leaves his hat
and his sermons (which he intends to sell) behind, and has to return
for them. Adams at first appears to be a stock character - the typical
absent-minded scholar familiar in literature. But Fielding takes this
stock figure and gives it individuality. He lands into misadventure after
misadventure - he wanders from inn to inn without the means to pay
his bills, he is beaten, swindled and mocked at, he is involved in



               English Fiction / 24
hilarious nightly adventures -but he never loses his innate dignity and
goodness.


2.2.2 Joseph
  Joseph Andrews is supposedly the only son of Gaffar and
Gammer Andrews and the brother of Pamela. In fact he is the son of
Mr. Wilson. Joseph was stolen by gypsies as a child and left with Mrs.
Andrews who brought him up as her own son. Mr. Andrews recognises
him by a strawberry mark on his breast. At the early age of ten he is
made an apprentice to Sir Thomas Booby and at seventeen becomes
Lady Booby's footman. He has a very musical voice, and instead of
scaring the birds, his cries attract them, and the hounds turn from the
huntsman and his horn to follow the boy's tuneful notes. He is virtuous
and handsome, and being well read in the Bible and influenced by
Parson Adams, he preserves his purity in the midst of temptations. At
the time of the novel he is twenty-one years old. He has nut-brown,
curly hair and dark eyes. When in danger, he is ready to fight
courageously, and never hesitates his to risk his life for Adams or
Fanny. Though for the most part, he is nothing more than the amusing
figure of a young lover, simple and frank, both morally and physically
vigorous, a few weeks of life on the roads develops the boy into a man
- the boy who wrote timid letters to his sister changes into the young
man who defends his beloved Fanny when she is chided by Adams.


2.2.3 The Women Characters
    Fanny Goodwill is the child of Mr. and Mrs. Andrews and the sister
of Pamela. She was stolen by gypsies in her infancy. At the age of
three she was sold to Sir Thomas Booby and raised as a servant in
Lady Booby's family. She is nineteen years old, beautiful and plump,
and very modest. She is also poor, and can neither read nor write.
    Mrs. Slipslop, Lady Booby's companion, is one of the most
delightful characters in the novel. She is forty-five years old, short,
heavy-set, red-faced, large-nosed and pimpled, and not at all
attractive. She is of gentle birth, the daughter of a curate. She believes
herself to be learned and argues on theology with Adams. She often
mispronounces what she intends to say or uses the wrong words
(malapropisms), and her dignity, servility, insolence and her


                              Henry Fielding : Joseph Andrews / 25
sensuality, all give her a life-like reality.
  Lady Booby, the wife of Sir Thomas Booby, takes Joseph with her to
London as her servant, attempts to seduce him & when unsuccessful
dismisses him from service. Later, still desiring him, she tries to
prevent his marriage to Fanny. She is very conscious of her social
superiority, and is torn between her passion for Joseph and her
humiliation at loving her servant. Lady Booby reveals herself almost
completely through her actions e.g. in her attempted seduction of
Joseph, and her attempts to thwart his proposed marriage. She is
portrayed as a proud, ruthless, vain, selfish, hypocritical and immoral
woman.


2.2.4 Other Minor Characters
 Pamela Andrews is based on the heroine of Richardson's Pamela,
who, as a servant, protects her chastity from her rich employer, Mr. B
- who fails to seduce her, and marries her. In Joseph Andrews, she is
the supposed sister of Joseph and, unknown to her, the sister of
Fanny. Joseph looks upon her as a model of chastity. Fielding amuses
himself by showing her as a young wife who preaches and moralizes
without end and does not want to have any connection with Fanny as
she regards her as socially inferior.
  Fielding's minor characters are also vividly portrayed and have a
distinct identity of their own. Peter Pounce who holds back the salaries
of servants and charges high interest on loans, Parson Trulliber with
his greediness, shrewish Mrs. Tow-wouse who scolds her erring
husband, Beau Didapper the typical 18th century dandy, all serve to
make a colourful gallery of characters. All these individual types are
clearly characterized e.g. a traveller in a coach, a post-boy, an inn-
keeper, appear for one instant, yet they remain firmly engraved upon
the mind.

             2.3 The Structure of Joseph Andrews
2.3.1 Joseph Andrews and drama
   Many critics have commented that Joseph Andrews resembles a
play perhaps because Fielding was an experienced dramatist). The
four books are said to resemble four acts, in which the first book
presents the problem, the second and the third present the
complications and the fourth book presents the unfolding of the action.
At the same time, the first part of every chapter, the preface, is an
informal essay -obviously the work of a man who wrote in 18th century
periodicals. Conditioned by his experiences as a playwright, he has
broken his action into scenes, which enable him to juxtapose incidents
and characters so that they comment on each other. When Fielding
wants to retard the action, he does so by using the simplest means
e.g. rain or storm force the characters to stop at an inn, they cannot
leave because they do not have money to pay the bill, thieves rob
them, or a judge arrests them. But although the devices are so simple,
nothing remains unexplained. The novel is thus subjected to the
discipline of drama, which give it life even though it is a novel of
character.


2.3.2      The careful organisation of the novel
   The careful organization of the novel is seen in its structure. The
story begins with the supposed history of Joseph's parentage and the
last chapter reveals his true father. The story also begins in the
country house of the Boobys which is also Adam's parish. Joseph,
Adams, Lady Booby and Mrs. Slipslop, four of the five principal
characters, are introduced. Fanny's late appearance is meant as a
surprise. The action shifts to London for a short while. Then the
narrative moves through the countryside as Joseph and later others
return towards the parish from which the story began. So the novel
begins with a group of characters who are dispersed and come



                              Henry Fielding : Joseph Andrews / 27
together again while other significant characters are added. Finally the
original group, enlarged by Pamela and her husband, Mr. Wilson, Mr.
and Mrs. Andrews, and the pedlar, reassemble for the wedding of
Joseph and Fanny. Fielding took surprising care to provide
symmetries within the narrative, e.g. Lady Booby expresses similar
passions and conflicting emotions in Book I and Book IV, Pamela is
mentioned early in Book I and late in Book IV, Joseph and Fanny are
reunited at inns in Book II, Chapter 12 and Book III, Chapter 12, and
the attempted rape and abduction of Fanny occurs in Book II, Chapter
9, and Book III, Chapter 9. Besides symmetry there are many
contrasts, e.g. Lady Booby is unfaithful to her husband while Joseph
is faithful to Fanny, Adams's conduct contrasts the behaviour of
Trulliber.


2.3.3        The ending of the novel
  It has often been observed that Joseph Andrews has a weak ending
because it appears to be a contrived one. Joseph is found to be the
son of a gentleman, Mr. Wilson, while Fanny, far from being a
foundling, is the daughter of Gaffar and Gammar Andrews. Bourgeois
proprieties are satisfied, and no one opposes the marriage, which
brings the book to a happy ending. Yet this denouement is not brought
about clumsily, because Fielding is at pains to lead on to the surprise
gradually. Fanny is found to be the daughter of the Andrews, so that
for some time everyone believes her to be Joseph's sister, which
allows the novelist to show us the different reactions of the chief
characters to the situation. E.g. grief of Fanny and Joseph, Pamela's
moralizing, the advice of Adams, and hope blossoming in the heart of
Lady Booby, Finally Mr. Wilson arrives and recognizes Joseph as his
long-lost son by the strawberry mark on his chest. But it should be
noted that the arrival of Mr. Wilson, which takes place in Chapter XV,
is announced as early as Chapter V.

      2.4 Joseph Andrews as a Picaresque Novel
   Joseph Andrews is often called "a novel of adventure", but
adventure plays only a minor part because the characters are seen to
be far more important than the action in the novel. The picaresque
novel (which narrated the adventures of the picaro - a vagabond who
journeyed for some time before he was rewarded with happiness) was
popular during this time and Joseph Andrews is said to belong to this
tradition. This kind of a novel had a very loose plot, while Fielding's
novel, as we have seen, has a well-constructed plot. One can
conclude by saying that Fielding's novel began in the picaresque
tradition, but developed into a novel of character. The narrator of
Joseph Andrews is the omniscient narrator, who holds opinions,
comments upon events, and guides the reader through the novel by
means of common sense and universally held opinions. But he is often
ironic, satirically meaning the opposite of what he explicitly says, and
the reader has to be alert for the narrator's irony and sense of humour.

   Fielding's Joseph Andrews is regarded as a landmark in the
history of the novel because with Fielding, the novel had come of age.

In it, he introduced middle-class realism, which was to be a very
important aspect of this literary form. Though novelists like Tobias
Smollett, Oliver Goldsmith and others developed it further, it was Jane
Austen who succeeded in combining realism with a precision of
structure. This is seen in her Pride and Prejudice, which we are going
to study in the next chapter.


                           2.6 Summary
  We have studied the major aspects of Joseph Andrews. Before
proceeding to the next chapter, let us recall what we have read earlier.
In Joseph Andrews, Fielding presents Joseph, the chaste servant
whom Lady Booby tries to tempt from the path of virtue. To save his
chastity, Joseph runs away, and meets Parson Adams, who
accompanies him for the rest of the journey. They have a series of
adventures, in which Fielding introduces a gallery of characters
including Joseph's sweetheart Fanny, Lady Booby, Mrs. Slipslop,
Betty the maid, Mr. and Mrs. Tow-wouse, the postillion, the pedlar,
Parson Trulliber etc. Along with the hilarious incidents, Fielding
introduces an element of suspense which involves the birth of Joseph
and Fanny, who appear to be brother and sister, and thus cannot
marry. But a happy ending is contrived when they can marry because
Fanny is discovered to be the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, and
Joseph the son of Mr. Wilson.
  Though there are numerous characters in the novel, Parson Adams,
Joseph, Fanny, Mrs. Slipslop and Lady Booby are the main ones in the
story. The most interesting of these is Parson Adams, the eccentric
cleric, who is a mixture of scholarship, simplicity, courage and absent-
mindedness. Joseph is the typical hero, young, handsome, virtuous
and loyal to his lady love Fanny, who is also beautiful, modest and
virtuous. Mrs. Slipslop, the middle-aged malaprop, the arrogant and
immoral Lady Booby, Pamela, Joseph's vain sister, are some
interesting characters. Fielding's novel shows careful organisation in
the arrangement of the incidents, division into books and chapters and
the depiction of characters. It is often regarded as an example of the
picaresque novel (which narrates the adventures of the picaro in a
very loosely constructed plot), but has a more compact plot.

 Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice

Introduction to Jane Austen and the
social background of her novels
     Jane Austen was born in Hampshire in 1775. Her father was a
clergyman and she was the last but one of a family of eight children.
Accompanied by Cassandra, her sister and life-long friend, she went
to school first at Oxford and then at Reading, but her education was
completed at home under the supervision of her father. She lived
quietly, a happy and uneventful life. She began writing at an early age,
but her first novel, Sense and Sensibility, was published in 1811,
followed by Pride and Prejudice in 1813, Mansfield Park in 1814,
Emma in 1815, and Northanger Abbey and Persuasion in 1817.She
fell ill and died in 1817.
    England was undergoing a rapid change in Jane Austen's lifetime.
The economy was changing from an agricultural to an industrial one
and the aristocratic world of the 18th century was giving way to a new
one. Yet Jane Austen's novels hardly mirror all this. This was because
she lived a sheltered life in southern England, which remained
agricultural. The England of her novels was still that of 18th century
elegance and easy living. Thus Jane Austen's world was a closed
world in which a very small proportion of the total population
participated, and this is the world her novels reflect. Class distinctions
were very rigid and were divided thus: the land-owning aristocracy
and the settled gentry; the new prosperous industrialists; the workers
and the labourers. Pride and Prejudice is set exclusively in the context
of the upper classes (eg. The Bingleys, the Darcys, Lady Catherine de
Bourgh). None of the major characters works, for these moneyed
classes lived entirely on their on their income from rents and
inheritances, and they looked down on traders like Mr. Gardiner, who
earn their money in business. Within the upper classes, there were
further petty distinctions arising from the amount of wealth possessed
by its members, e.g. The Bingley sisters look down upon the Bennets,

                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 33
because they are not as wealthy as they are, while they have enormous
respect for Mr. Darcy because of his income of ten thousand pounds
per annum. The occupations of this class were largely social: dinner-
parties, balls, and a daily round of trivialities - visits to friends, a few
household tasks which were considered good enough for them, etc.
One should note that Jane Austen had very little material to work
from. That she should have been able to construct a worth-while novel
from such trivia is in itself no mean achievement.


Summary of Pride and Prejudice
  Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a social comedy set in the
provincial society of Hertfordshire, England, around the 18th century.
Austen begins with the maxim that "a single man in possession of a
good fortune must be in want of a wife". Marriage is a constant
pursuit in Austen's comic world. Local balls are a source of
continuous gossip and speculation. The key stumbling block to
marriage, as the title suggests, is a disparity in social class. When the
novel opens, Mrs. Bennet is excited by the news that a rich, eligible
young bachelor is moving into the neighbourhood. With five
unmarried daughters, her mind is preoccupied with finding husbands
for them, and Mr. Bingley would clearly be an excellent catch. The
Bennets discuss the expected arrival of Mr. Bingley and Mrs. Bennet
wants her husband to make his acquaintance before her neighbours.
Mr. Bennet is ironic and pretends not to understand. He does visit Mr.
Bingley but does not tell his wife, and later, matter-of-factly reveals the
news of his visit. Mr. Bingley repays Mr. Bennet's call and then goes
to fetch a group for the ball. Mr. Bingley arrives with a party from
London, which consist of two sisters, a brother-in-law, and his friend
Mr. Darcy. Bingley is immediately said to be good looking and
gentlemanlike, while Darcy, who dances only with the Bingley sisters
and remains aloof, is regarded as a most disagreeable man. Elizabeth
feels insulted when she overhears Bingley trying to persuade Darcy to
dance with her. He refuses and says that she is only tolerable. The next
morning the two eldest sisters discuss the ball. Jane admits that she
admires Bingley, who has paid particular attention to her. Bingley and
Darcy also do the same, but while Bingley is generous with his praise,
Darcy finds little to applaud. The excitement also necessitates visits
around town, where Mrs. Bennet triumphs over Jane's success. As

                English Fiction / 34
their socializing continues, Darcy finds himself increasingly
impressed with Elizabeth's wit and beauty. At a dinner party, a
pompous Sir Lucas tries to persuade him to dance with Elizabeth, but
while he is willing, she refuses. Mr. Bennet's property is entailed and
will not be inherited by any of his daughters. He and his wife disagree
over the intelligence of Lydia and Kitty, who are always running after
the officers in the militia. They take after their mother who once liked
soldiers herself and encourages her daughters in their behaviour.
Miss Bingley invites Jane to dinner in her brother's absence; and Mrs.
Bennet sends her on horseback, thinking it will rain so that Jane must
then stay overnight. News comes next morning that Jane has caught
cold. Elizabeth anxiously walks the three miles to Netherfield, causing
great surprise when she arrives at breakfast time.
    Elizabeth sees how hypocritical the regard of the Bingley sisters
for Jane is. They soon forget her illness despite their assurances of
sympathy. Mr. Hurst lives only lives to eat and play cards. Miss
Bingley criticises Elizabeth severely when she is out of the room.
Bingley defends Jane and Elizabeth against her criticism of their
relatives. Although Darcy is further attracted to Elizabeth by her walk,
he accepts that the inferiority of their relatives in social standing will
hinder Jane and Elizabeth making good marriages.
     The next morning Jane is no worse, but Elizabeth sends a note to
her mother asking her come to Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet and her two
youngest arrive soon after breatfast and she and the doctor decide that
Jane cannot return home. Mrs. Bennet thank Mr. Bingley and his
sisters for their kindness to Jane, and in doing so makes an utter fool
of herself. They return home and Elizabeth goes back to Jane. Jane is
a little by evening and, after dinner, Elizabeth joins the party in the
drawing-room. Darcy is writing a letter but Miss Bingley is sitting
nearby trying to distract his attention. Darcy finishes his letter and
asks Miss Bingley for some music. Darcy's eyes are frequently fixed on
her, but Elizabeth thinks it is only because he disapproves of her
appearance - she has no idea that he now admires her. Jane comes
down to the drawing-room after dinner. Mr. Bingley is delighted to see
her and sits down by her side, hardly talking to anyone else. Next
morning Elizabeth writes to her mother to ask for the carriage to come
and fetch them home. The match-making Mrs. Bennet, however, is
anxious that the visit should be for the prolonged and sends a message


                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 35
that the carriage will not be available before Tuesday. But Elizabeth
is determined to leave and borrows Mr. Bingley's carriage to take
them home the following day. Darcy avoids them, Mr. Bennet is glad
to see them, but Mrs. Bennet is disappointed, and does not welcome
them home. The next morning Mr. Bennet informs his wife that they
are to have a guest to dinner. He has received a letter from his cousin,
Mr. Collins, who, after Mr. Bennet's death, will inherit the Longbourn
estate. Mr. Collins has obtained his parish through the patronage of
Lady Catherine, a wealthy widow with an only daughter. He is always
eloquent in his praise of this lady. Mr. Collins, having a good house
and a sufficient income, intends to marry and has visited Longbourn
with the intention of choosing one of the Bennet daughters. He likes
Jane but Mrs. Bennet makes it clear that her affections are engaged
and he turns his attention to Elizabeth. One morning, the sisters walk
into Meryton, accompanied by Mr. Collins. They meet two young men
Denny and Wickham, and later Bingley and Darcy. Both Darcy and
Wickham seem upset at the sight of each other. The Bennet sisters, with
Collins, dine with their aunt and uncle and Wickham is one of the
officers who join the party. Elizabeth is delighted when he sits near
her and begins to talk about Darcy. He tells her that Darcy has treated
him unfairly. He says that Lady Catherine is a fitting aunt for Darcy,
because she is arrogant and proud. Elizabeth tells Jane what she has
heard about Darcy's unkindness to Wickham. But Jane does not
believe her. Bingley and his sisters invite the Bennets to a ball at
Netherfield. On the night of the ball, Elizabeth is disappointed that
Wickham is not present and realises that he has done so to avoid
Darcy. Later in the evening she dances with Darcy and though she is
still unimpressed by him there are signs that he is attracted by her.
During supper Elizabeth is embarrassed to hear her mother speaking
openly to Lady Lucas of her expectation that Jane will marry Bingley.
After supper she is further mortified by her younger sister Mary's
efforts to sing because her voice is weak and manner affected. Mr.
Collins gives a pompous speech and later comes to her side where he
remains for the rest of the evening.
  The following day Mr. Collins asks permission to speak to Elizabeth
alone. He informs her that he has chosen her to be his wife. When
Elizabeth declines the proposal he replies that it is usual for young
ladies first to reject the man they secretly mean to accept. Elizabeth


               English Fiction / 36
denies this but Collins persists in his beliefs that she really intends to
marry him so she decides to tell her father to deal with this suitor.
Soon after Elizabeth has left the room, Mrs. Bennet enters and
congratulates Collins. He returns the congratulations with pleasure
and tells her of Elizabeth's modesty. Her mother cannot believe him
but assures him that she is headstrong and foolish and will be brought
to reason. She tells Mr. Bennet to tell Elizabeth to accept him. Mr.
Bennet tells Elizabeth that her mother will never see her again if she
does not marry Collins but that her father will never see her again if
she does. Mrs. Bennet tries to coax Elizabeth to accept Collins but her
daughter is firm in her refusal.
     Mr. Collins then turns his attention to Elizabeth's friend Charlotte
Lucas and proposes to her. She accepts and her family is delighted.
When she tells Elizabeth about is, she is horrified but Charlotte tells
she prefers marriage with Mr. Collins to the lonely future which she
risks if she does not accept his proposal. Mrs. Bennet is very upset by
this news and cannot forgive Elizabeth or Charlotte. The wedding of
Charlotte and Mr. Collins takes place and Charlotte extracts a
promise from Elizabeth that she will visit them. In March Elizabeth
accompanies Sir Lucas and his daughter Maria to stay with Charlotte.
Charlotte seems contented with marriage and bears her husband's
irritating behaviour with composure. They visit Lady Catherine who
lives nearby. She is a large woman with strong features and an
authoritative way of speaking. She advises how to manage her home,
her cows and her poultry and takes great pleasure in dictating to
others. She asks Elizabeth many impertinent questions about her
family and is astonished when Elizabeth stands up to her.
     Mr. Darcy arrives at Lady Catherine's house with his cousin
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who is about thirty years old and, though not
good-looking has pleasing manners. That evening when they visit
Lady Catherine Fitzwilliam is attracted by Elizabeth while Darcy
keeps looking towards them. The following morning Elizabeth is
sitting alone writing to Jane when to her surprise Darcy enters the
room and talks to her for a little while. After this Darcy comes often
and Elizabeth notices that he looks at her a great deal but speaks little.
One day, Mr. Darcy unexpectedly calls, and with unusual agitation,
abruptly declares his love to an astonished Elizabeth. He explains that
he has struggled in vain against an attachment that would link him to


                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 37
an inferior family. Elizabeth angrily refuses him. Darcy is shocked
because he expected a favourable answer, but Elizabeth censures him
for his ungentlemanly behaviour and accuses him of having ruined his
sister's happiness and having destroyed the career of the noble Mr.
Wickham. Darcy leaves in anger. The next morning Elizabeth is
passing the park gates when Darcy hands her a letter and walks away.
Elizabeth reads the letter, in which Darcy explains that he persuaded
Bingley to give up any thoughts of Jane because he thought that Jane
did not return Bingley's affection. Darcy now realises that he may be
mistaken. He goes on to say that Mrs. Bennet and the younger
daughters often show a lack of propriety which is unfitting in a family
into which Bingley should marry. This fact influenced him to part Jane
and his friend. Darcy adds that Elizabeth and Jane were always
extremely well behaved. He informs Elizabeth that Wickham was the
son of his father's estate manager to whom Darcy's father was always
kind and helped in school and college, intending to provide for him in
the church if he made it his profession. After the father's death,
Wickham wrote to Darcy, saying that he did not intend to become a
clergyman and asked for the money instead. He accepted the three
thousand pounds that Darcy gave him instead of the church career.
When the money had been gambled away, Wickham tried to improve
his finances by eloping with Darcy's fifteen-year-old sister. Darcy had
discovered the clot in time to save his sister in disgrace and had
broken all ties with him. Elizabeth finds Darcy's story difficult to
believe, but as she reconsiders Wickham's behaviour she begins to see
the truth. In a painful moment of self-recognition, she realises that her
vanity and wounded pride have lead her to make wrong judgements.
When, after hours of wandering, she returns to the house, she finds
that Darcy and his cousin have already left for London.
  Elizabeth departs after another week's stay. She leaves still occupied
with thoughts of Darcy. In London, Jane joins her and they meet the
two youngest sisters. Elizabeth is ashamed of their silliness and poor
manners. At home, Elizabeth tells Jane of Darcy's proposal and
Wickham's past which they decide to keep a secret. The younger
Bennet sisters are disappointed because the militia is scheduled to
depart. Lydia is invited by one of the officer's wives to visit them in
Brighton, the new station. Elizabeth secretly advices her father
against Lydia's trip, but he lets her go. Elizabeth plans to visit the


               English Fiction / 38
home of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, but at the last moment her uncle's
plans change and they go only as far as Derbyshire, which is where
Darcy has his estate. Mrs. Gardiner takes Elizabeth to see the estate
which is named Pemberly. The housekeeper is sincere in her praise of
Darcy as master and brother. As she is walking in the garden, she sees
Darcy who has just arrived from London. She is surprised and
embarrassed but also astonished at his solicitous manners. Although
her uncle is only a businessman, he asks for an introduction and acts
as a gracious host. The next morning Darcy brings his sister to call on
Elizabeth. Miss Darcy is a reserved girl of sixteen who struggles
against her shyness. Her feelings towards him have changed from
dislike to respect and gratitude. Then a letter from Jane announces a
terrible calamity: Lydia has eloped with Mr. Wickham, and Mr. Bennet
has gone to London to look further. Just as Elizabeth finishes the letter,
Darcy enters, and overcome with distress she tells him the news. He is
shocked and soon departs. Elizabeth, her aunt and uncle return home.
    They find Mrs. Bennet very upset and full of self-pity. No news has
arrived from London. It is discovered that Wickham owes money to
almost every local tradesman as well as a thousand pounds in
gambling debts in Brighton. A letter of condolence arrives from Mr.
Collins who observes that the death of their daughter would have been
a lesson in comparison to this and congratulates himself at not having
married into the family. Mr. Bennet returns disheartened from London,
and admits to Elizabeth that he has been too lenient in Lydia's
upbringing. News finally comes from Mr. Gardiner. He has found the
couple, they are to be married, and Mr. is to pay a small yearly
allowance in return. Mrs. Bennet instantly recovers in anticipation of
the marriage. Elizabeth realises but all hope of marrying Darcy has
been destroyed by her family's new connection to Wickham. Lydia
comes to Longbourn on the day of her marriage oblivious to the
suffering she has caused. Several days later Lydia describes her
wedding to Elizabeth and mentions that Darcy had been present.
Elizabeth asks her aunt and comes to know that had brought the
marriage, by offering Wickham a large sum of money and convincing
him that he should marry Lydia.
   Bingley comes to call Jane and Darcy accompanies him. They all
meet again at a dinner party where Bingley continues to admire Jane
and everyone begins to wonder about their engagement. Darcy leaves


                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 39
for London and Bingley begins to call on the Bennets daily. He
proposes to Jane and she consents to marry him. In the midst of their
happiness, Lady Catherine arrives and demands an audience with
Elizabeth. Elizabeth is astonished by her visit and even more surprised
when she accuses her of a secret engagement to Darcy. Elizabeth
refuses to be bullied by her guest's questions, and Lady Catherine's
irritation grows and she insists that Darcy will marry her daughter.
Elizabeth refuses to promise not to accept Darcy and Lady Catherine
leaves, seriously displeased. Several days later, Darcy returns and
calls on them with Bingley. Elizabeth can no longer refrain from
thanking him for what he has done for Lydia, and he tells her he has
acted only out of concern for her. He then reveals his unaltered
affections, and Elizabeth explains her own change of heart. Both
lovers then admit their faults. Elizabeth had been rash and thoughtless
while Darcy had been haughty and proud. The next evening Darcy
asks Mrs. Bennet for Elizabeth's hand. Her father calls her to the
library, troubled by this unexpected news, but is reassured of her
feelings. Bemused at the rapid series of betrothals, he tells Elizabeth
that if any young men came for Mary or Kitty, they should be sent in
to him. Mrs. Bennet is astonished to learn that the disagreeable Darcy
is to be her son-in-law and is happy because of his ten-thousand-
income. Thus the two courtships end happily and Jane and Elizabeth
are safely married.

d) Discuss the themes in the novel in detail


                          3.1 Introduction
    In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen tells us about the Bennet


                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 41
family, particularly about the two elder daughters Jane and Elizabeth,
who have to face various problems before winning the love of their
respective suitors. While doing so, she presents a vivid picture of
provincial England of the 18th century, with touches of humour and
irony that add charm to the story.


        3.2 Characterization in Pride and Prejudice
3.2.1     Elizabeth Bennet
  Pride and Prejudice is brought vividly to life by a gallery of different
and contrasting characters. Not all of these are complex for eg. Jane
and Bingley are simpler and, less intricate than Darcy and Elizabeth
because psychologically they have no great. They suffer setbacks at
the hands of other more complex characters, while those complex
characters create their own problems, to the confusion of themselves
and others. Less beautiful than her sister Jane, whom she loves
without jealousy, Elizabeth is much more spirited and independent
than a twenty-year old lady of her times would be. She is impatient
with pretensions and conventions, but at the same time, she
understands the value of propriety and good taste. She is her father's
favourite, having inherited his wit and intelligence. Her lively playful
nature makes her attractive, well-liked by women (eg. Her aunt and
Charlotte Lucas), and much admired by men. Her judgment is not as
correct as she imagines, and once her pride is hurt, as it is by Darcy
cutting remarks at the ball, it is badly clouded by prejudice in which
she stubbornly persists, in the belief that she is being clever. For all
her intelligence and perception she makes bad mistakes of judgment.
She lets Wickham's manners and appearance bias her against Darcy.
She allows her own pride to prejudice her against him. She sees the
bad breeding of her younger sisters and the folly of her mother. Her
advice to her father against Lydia going to Brighton is mature and
realistic. When she falls in love with Darcy, she does so having first felt
respect and gratitude towards him. Although not anxious by nature,
she is upset over Jane's unhappiness and her own uncertainty over
Darcy. From the time she receives Darcy's letter, her eyes are opened,
and she acknowledges that she never knew herself. Her intellectual
acknowledgement of her own pride and prejudice comes much earlier
than her understanding of her emotions, which shift gradually from


                English Fiction / 42
hatred of Darcy to love of him. Despite her youth, she refuses to defer
to Lady Catherine and is not brow-beaten by her. She has enough
sharp wit to out-argue Lady Catherine and the moral courage to defy
her. She has faults, but they are faults of impulsive generosity, not
meanness of spirit. With typical fair-mindedness, she admits her
errors and struggles towards a mature self-knowledge. Elizabeth has
originality, especially in her liveliness, which makes her an interesting
character. In doing the unexpected but at the same time remaining
sensible, she is a more life-like heroine than the conventional heroine
of sentimental novels.


3.2.2   Fitzwilliam Darcy
   Fitzwilliam Darcy, when seen from the outside appears to be
pompous and solemn, in keeping with his great pride. He contrasts
sharply with Elizabeth by lacking all lightness of touch. An aristocrat
with ten thousand pounds a year, he quickly attracts criticism at the
ball because of the aloof contempt he shows to the company at large,
and earns Elizabeth's resentment by deliberately insulting her. His
rudeness    and    haughtiness    are   defensive:    that   contrary   to
appearances, he is basically shy, too serious by nature for the
frivolities of society, too sincere in his feelings to be able to make the
charming display of them that comes naturally to a hypocrite like
Wickham. Initially we see Darcy as Elizabeth sees him (and she is
very biased), but we are subsequently given more and more evidence
of his true nature, culminating in the testimony of Mrs. Reynolds, the
housekeeper at Pemberley, who speaks of him as an ideal master and
landlord, an excellent brother, a model of good nature and generosity.
Meanwhile, the natural good taste of Pemberley itself is a powerful
witness to the kind of man Darcy really is. In the end, Elizabeth has to
acknowledge not only that he has been fairer to Wickham than he
deserves, but also that his part in bringing about a separation between
Bingley and Jane was not malicious, but done out of a concern for his
friend in the excusable belief that Jane was not in love.
   Darcy resolves the disgrace of Lydia's elopement by a practical
marriage-settlement, and does so secretly, though once the secret is
exposed, it confirms the deep sincerity and constancy of his love for
Elizabeth. He has come a long way in self-knowledge since he
offended Elizabeth by his patronising proposal. His pride, but not his

                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 43
self-respect, has been humbled. He, like Elizabeth has come to realise
they are equals, as people; that his family, like hers, is not exempt
from vulgarity (Lady Catherine and Mrs. Bennet are very similar by
nature). Both of them see through silly formalities and conventions;
both take pride in their discernment; both dislike vulgarity and, most
importantly of all, both of them come to see through appearances and
to share the same moral perspective. There is some truth in
Elizabeth's claim that her attraction for Darcy resulted from his being
'sick of civility, of defence, of officious attention' from women like
Caroline Bingley; he comes most alive in dialogue when challenged by
Elizabeth's wit, but is rather rigid and wooden as a character. Like
Elizabeth, we have hopes that, in return for the 'judgment, information
and knowledge of the world' he brings in marriage, she will succeed in
her effort to get him to relax and laugh more at himself.


3.2.3      Jane Bennet
  Jane Bennet is so beautiful, physically and by nature, that she is
beyond the criticism of even Darcy and Caroline Bingley. Her
'sweetness and disinterestedness' may be 'really angelic,' but this
often makes her naïve in her judgements. She is too good-natured in
herself to discover harm or bad nature in others. She has genuine
modesty and humility and this prevents her from giving enough
positive encouragement to Bingley, as the shrewd Charlotte Lucas is
quick to see; indeed, her character lacks forcefulness of any kind, and
her sufferings and delights are passive, never the result of any action
on her part. In sharp contrast with Elizabeth, Jane has the simplest of
natures. She is far less conscious of the vulgarity and shortcomings of
her family than Elizabeth, who agonises over them, and she is
painfully slow in forcing to recognise what Elizabeth sees at a glance:
that Caroline Bingley is two-faced and no real friend. Her courtship
and marriage belonged to the tradition of the sentimental novel. Hers
is love at first sight, as is Bingley's. External difficulties prevent it from
running its smooth course, but in itself it is an unclouded romantic
love. It has something child-like about it, but Jane herself is in many
ways child-like.




                English Fiction / 44
3.2.4   Charles Bingley
    Charles Bingley is a perfect match for Jane. Since he shares her
good nature, is modest, passive and acted upon, without ever acting
himself. When Elizabeth makes a distinction between characters who
can be perfectly understood because of their simplicity and
straightforwardness and those who are complex and intricate, she is
mentally contrasting him with Darcy. He stands in contrast to Darcy in
the same way as Jane does to Elizabeth, and therefore is an extrovert,
not snobbish easily pleased, and not critical of others. Just as
Elizabeth watches protectively over Jane, so Darcy protects Bingley
and orders his life for him.


3.2.5   Mr. Bennet
   Mr. Bennet is an intelligent man, attractive and amusing. But
having made an unwise marriage with a woman of low intelligence, he
does not take care to conceal from his children the contempt he feels
for his vulgar and stupid wife. He thinks that his daughters are silly and
ignorant like most girls. He is disillusioned and diverts himself with
books and by ridiculing everyone. But his sarcasm does not excuse
the neglect of his daughters. He feels to discipline and allows their
mother to encourage their ignorance and vanity. Far from giving his
children the support they badly need, he withdraws himself physically
and psychologically for all parental responsibility. Elizabeth and her
father are seen in reverse roles when she pleads with him not to give
permission to Lydia to go to Brighton, while he jokes about Elizabeth's
seriousness. Later, he is very disturbed by Lydia's elopement which
shakes him into action and he realizes that a more disciplined
upbringing could have prevented her thoughtless behavior.


3.2.6   Mrs. Bennet
    Mrs. Bennet is more of a caricature and her only interest in life is
to get her daughters married, go visiting and keep in touch with all the
gossip in the neighbourhood. She is jealous of her neighbours except
when she can triumph over them. Her obsession with her daughters is
really a selfish one because having been beautiful herself, she wants
to relive her vanity through them, especially Jane and Lydia. She
criticises others freely when they are not present and wishes always


                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 45
to have her own way. Her schemes to marry off her daughters are very
indiscreet and tactless. Mrs. Bennet becomes irritable when things go
wrong eg. when Lydia elopes with Wickham. She recovers
immediately at the news of Lydia's arranged marriage to Wickham and
now regards it as a triumph, boasting about it to the neighbours. But
her biggest change of face comes with Darcy, when she at first calls
him disagreeable and hateful, and later calls him charming and
gentlemanly. Lacking in moral awareness, she is childish, self-
centered and uncharitable to everyone outside her family.


3.2.7     Mr. Collins
  Mr. Collins is a source of humour through his pompous and affected
behaviour which he carries to the point of ridiculousness. His courtship
of Elizabeth ending in the proposal of marriage is humorous because
he is completely unaware of anyone's feelings except his own. His
style, in his conversation and letters, exposes as a pretentious,
hypocritical fool, who does not have much education or refinement but
who is egoistic and a sycophant.


3.2.8     Other minor characters
  Lydia is the only other Bennet daughter to play an important role in
the novel. She shows herself to be a silly unprincipled girl whose only
interest in life is to attract men. She is the youngest and resembles the
mother more than any of them. Mrs. Bennet relives her youth through
Lydia whom she encourages when she badly needs to be disciplined.
She is not well-read, bold, vulgar and very immature. She never
shows the least moral awareness and her brash behaviour when she
comes as a bride is a testimony to her stupidity and bad taste. Lady
Catherine is an egoist and a fitting patron for Mr. Collins. An aristocrat
she is, conscious of her own self-importance and wants to be
respected by everyone. She always gives her opinion and does not
expect to e contradictory. She is a caricature of all that is worst in rank
and privilege - the aristocratic class at its most materialistic and ill-
bred. Her proud assertion of good breeding exposes her lack of it, and
Darcy realizes that his aunt and Mrs. Bennet closely resemble each
other. Charlotte Lucas is Elizabeth's best friend, sensible and
intelligent, but plain in appearance. She is twenty-seven and realizes


                English Fiction / 46
that her chances of a good marriage are not great. So she accepts
Collins being of the opinion that happiness in marriage is completely
a matter of chance. George Wickham has a fine countenance, a good
figure and a pleasing manner - outward advantages that he uses well
to deceive everyone. He is the exact opposite of Darcy and usually
makes a good impression in society. He is totally selfish, unscrupulous
and lacking in morals. His seduction of Lydia is loveless, calculating
and carried out in a ruthless manner.

         3.3 The Structure of Pride and Prejudice
     Pride and Prejudice is a well-constructed novel in which the events
follow logically, there are no digressions, the sub-plots are related
closely to the main plot, and the characters and action complement
and supplement each other. The first six chapters introduce the
Bennets, Lucases, Darcy and the Bingleys, and also give the reader
hints about the development of the plot. After Jane returns from
Netherfield, Wickham and Collins are introduced, and this leads to first
high point in the story - the Netherfield ball. The next few chapters deal
with Mr. Collins, his marriage to Charlotte, Elizabeth's contact with
Darcy which leads to the climax of the first half of the novel - Darcy's
proposal to Elizabeth and her rejection. Elizabeth also stops at the
Gardiners, giving the reader an opportunity to get to know these
characters and preparing him for their role in their latter part of the
story where they help to bring about a reunion of Elizabeth and Darcy.
Meanwhile, many hints have prepared for the elopement of Lydia and
Wickham, which, ironically acts as a catalyst to bring Darcy and
Elizabeth together. Into the main theme are woven the developing love
affairs of Jane and Lydia which act as a commentary on the central
story. Austen uses what is called the "Kaleidoscopic" presentation of


                              Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 47
the main characters, i.e., the reader is shown a first one aspect of
character, then the emphasis shifts, and a new aspect is shown. This
process continues until all aspects of the character have been
revealed. The plot of the novel is thus symmetrical, the
characterisation psychological, and nothing and no character is
unnatural or unnecessary. Jane Austen's technique and her
characterisation are so skillful that they cannot be considered apart.

        3.4 Some important themes in the novel
3.4.1 Marriage
  The opening lines of the novel ("It is a truth universally
acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune,
must be in want of a wife.") indicate the main theme of Pride and
Prejudice, which, as in all of Jane Austen's novels, is marriage. It is
mainly about the difficulties a couple has to overcome before they can
marry. Elizabeth and Darcy have to first overcome the obstacles within
their own selves viz. of pride (in Darcy) and prejudice (in Elizabeth)
before they can become suitable marriage partners. Elizabeth is
attractive and intelligent, Darcy is rich and handsome. But both have
to gain self-knowledge. This is because Darcy is proud and will not
humble himself while Elizabeth is hasty in her judgement and angered
at Darcy's haughty exterior. Darcy's upbringing makes him hesitate in
proposing to Elizabeth because of her lower social status but he does
so inspite of himself, because he is attracted by her lively mind,
affectionate nature and attractive appearance. He believes that
Elizabeth will accept him because he is so superior. But she feels
insulted by his patronising behaviour and rejects him. Darcy is seen
only through the eyes of Elizabeth and other people in society - it is at
the end that we learn of his generosity to Wickham and of his good
reputation among his employees. It is also at the end that we learn of


               English Fiction / 48
his feelings at crucial points in the story. The events which occur
towards the end eventually help Darcy and Elizabeth to resolve their
mistakes and accept each other for what they are. Thus their marriage
is founded on affection and understanding and not on blind impulse.
Austen contrasts other marriages against the story of Elizabeth and
Darcy. Charlotte's marriage to Collins is a compromise she makes
because she is twenty-seven, plain, and has no prospects of making
a good marriage. So she marries Collins who is inferior in intelligence,
only for the position he offers. Lydia and Wickham have married on the
basis of momentary attraction on her part and mercenary aim on his.
There appears to be little attachment between them and the future
does not seem to be a very happy one for them. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet
obviously have an incompatible marriage. They have nothing in
common because Mrs. Bennet is a selfish, vain, and unprincipled
woman who attracted Mr. Bennet because of her good looks. He
married her though she was inferior to him in intelligence, and now
regards her with contempt which he does not try to hide. The only
other marriage which is likely to be a happy one is that of Jane and
Bingley because they are both essentially good-natured and have
genuine affection for each other. But they are both too passive and
gentle and lack the liveliness that is seen in the relationship between
Elizabeth and Darcy.


3.4.2   Parental responsibility
    A further theme in the novel is that of parental responsibility,
though it is explored in negative, rather than positive terms. Mr.
Bennet has made the grave mistake of marrying a woman who had
nothing to commend her except a pretty face. Instead of accepting his
mistake and making the best of it by giving their children the support
they need, he has withdrawn himself physically and psychologically
from wife and family alike. He is lazy and takes the easy way out of his
difficulties by refusing to face them. His sharp wit is used as a defence
against any demand made on him. One instance of his neglect of his
parental duties is when he does not heed Elizabeth's warning that
Lydia should not be sent to Brighton. Elizabeth also suggests that her
younger sisters' impudent behaviour reflects badly on herself and
Jane. But Mr. Bennet childishly abandons all responsibility and treats
her warnings lightly with self-indulgent amusement. When Lydia


                             Jane Austen : Pride and Prejudice / 49
elopes, he tells Elizabeth that he deserves to suffer for his
irresponsibility, but when the matter is resolved, he is glad because it
will save him a world of trouble. Apart from his dismay at the
elopement, the only other occasion when he shows a father's concern
is when Elizabeth tells him of her intention to marry Darcy. Speaking
sincerely for once, out of the misery of his own experience, he then
begs her not to repeat his own mistake by making an incompatible
marriage. But there is no indication to show that either he or his wife
is aware that their children are victims of a disastrous marriage. The
only positive example of parental responsibility comes from her aunt
and uncle, whose sympathy, tact and good sense are a contrast to that
of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.


3.4.3        Appearance and reality
  The theme of appearance and reality is integrated into the total
moral perspective of the novel, and people are often far from being
what they appear to be. Outwardly, Mr. Collins is a Christian
clergyman, but he is by nature a sycophant and a hypocrite; Mr. Hurst
is outwardly a gentleman but actually a greedy mercenary; the
fashionable Bingley sisters can hardly wait for the door to close on
Elizabeth before criticizing her; and above all, Darcy and Wickham,
one who is actually good and one who only appears to be good. A
failure in self-knowledge also belongs to the theme of appearance and
reality. Both Darcy and Elizabeth have to discover their own genuine
selves, and this discovery comes along with their discovery of one
another. They learn to rid themselves of the illusions and
misunderstandings created by their pride and prejudice.

                           3.5 Conclusion
    Pride and Prejudice presents us with a world that is selective and
extremely restricted. But there is strength in this. The deliberately
chosen limitations allow the author perfect control of her materials.
She sets out to write a comedy of manners with total economy and
brilliantly succeeds because her narrow range is made to serve artistic
ends. The novel is very nearly perfect and has hardly a superfluous
incident, action, character or word. It is a novel of realistic social satire,
with complex human beings; set in everyday reality without
melodrama, and claims to be one of the earliest truly modern novels.


                             3.6 Summary
      In the preceding chapters, we have seen that Jane Austen
presents us with the Bennet family and the progress of the daughters
in courtship and marriage. Their new neighbour, Mr. Bingley, is a
prospective match for Jane, and fortunately gets on well with her. His
seemingly proud and haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, is attracted to
Elizabeth. When Jane visits the Bingleys, she is taken ill. Elizabeth
goes to nurse her, and finds herself in the company of Darcy, who
finds himself falling in love with her. The sisters meet Mr. Wickham,
who tells Elizabeth of how he suffered at the hands of Darcy. This
confirms her prejudice against him. Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth
and, being turned down, quickly switches to her friend Charlotte Lucas
, who accepts him. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth in a condescending
manner, and she rejects him. He gives her a letter, in which he puts
his side of the Wickham story. Lydia elopes with Wickham. Elizabeth
later learns that Darcy did a great deal for her family by helping the
couple. Misunderstandings between Elizabeth and Darcy are cleared,
and they marry, as do Jane and Bingley.

                  Charles Dickens :
                  David Copperfield


Introduction to Charles Dickens

    Born on 7 February 1812 in the south of England, Charles
Dickens was the second of eight children in the family of John
Dickens, a Navy clerk. Though he was a warm-hearted person, John
Dickens had no sense of responsibility, and was often in debt. Being
short of money, the family moved to London, but John fell even more
deeply into debt, and was sent to Marshalsea prison. He was joined
there by the rest of his family except Charles, who was sent to work in
a blacking factory. Charles was full of shame and misery at his
family's condition, and hated his job in the factory where he had to
undergo humiliation and ill-treatment. He could never forget this
period of disgust and loneliness in the factory, which is often reflected
in his novels when he writes about childhood with compassionate
understanding. He began his writing career by writing short pieces for
magazines, which appeared in a volume Sketches by Boz. He began
writing a humorous monthly serial, Pickwick Papers, which brought
him fame and popularity. In fact, many of his novels first appeared in
serial form and were later published as novels. Some of his well-
known novels are Oliver Twist (1837), David Copperfield (1849), A
Tale of Two Cities (1859), Great Expectations (1861), & many others.
 The age in which Dickens lived and wrote was the Victorian Age, the
reign of Queen Victoria, a time when modern Britain developed and
evolved. It was also a time of prosperity as well as change because the
Industrial Revolution had introduced machine production and made
the factory the centre of work. The growth of cities created many
social problems like poor housing and sanitation, crime, disease,
poverty, etc. As wages were low and housing often overcrowded, even
women and children were forced to work in factories for long hours.
Dickens was deeply concerned about these social problems and this


                            Charles Dickens : David Copperfield / 55
concern can be seen in all his writing. His sympathetic awareness of
contemporary social problems , and of the lives of the poor, the sick,
and the unfortunate, is a constant feature of his work.

Summary of David Copperfield
  David Copperfield is deeply attached to his mother, who was
widowed six months before his birth. His early childhood is a very
happy one, and once, he goes with his nurse Peggotty, for a holiday to
Yarmouth. They stay with her brother Mr. Peggotty and other relatives
in a boat-house. On his return, David finds that his mother has re-
married. He is ill-treated by his stepfather, Mr. Murdstone, and sent
away to Salem House, a school run by a cruel man named Creakle.
After his mother's death, David is sent to work for a few shillings a
week at Murdstone and Grinby's warehouse in London. He lodges
with Mr. Micawber and his family and becomes very attached to them.
But they leave London and David decides to go and find his great-
aunt, Miss Betsy Trotwood, who lives at Dover. But he is robbed of his
money and has to walk the whole way to her house. Miss Betsy is very
kind to him and sends him to an excellent school in Canterbury, wher
he boards with Mr. Wickfield and his daughter Agnes. Mr. Wickfield
has a weakness for drink and his cunning clerk, Uriah Heep, takes
advantage of this. After leaving school, David is articled to the firm of
Spenlow and Jorkins in London. He meets Mr. Spenlow's daughter,
Dora and falls madly in love with her, but Mr. Spenlow refuses to
consider him as a son-in-law. Miss Trotwood loses her money and
comes to live in London. David works extremely hard and becomes a
successful reporter and writer.
  After Mr. Spenlow's death, David and Dora are married. Dora is
pretty but silly and immature, and wishes to be regarded as a "child
wife". She loses a child, is very ill, and weakens slowly and dies. To
forget his grief, David goes abroad and is away for three years.
During this time, he realizes that he loves Agnes, but is sure that she
regards him as a brother. He returns to England and realizes that she
has always loved him. They are married. Miss Trotwood's fortune is
restored, and Uriah Heep is imprisoned for fraud. Mr. Peggotty's
family, as well as Mr. Micawber's family emigrate to Australia and live
happily there.

                          4.1 Introduction
    In the previous chapter, we could see how Jane Austen reflected
contemporary society in her Pride and Prejudice. David Copperfield,
which Dickens wrote a few years later, also presented a picture of
contemporary society, but the difference is that Austen restricts herself
to the upper middle class of rural England, while Dickens's canvas is
a larger one encompassing the middle class of his time, particularly
industrialized London. Another distinguishing factor was that Austen
was not concerned with social problems while Dickens was deeply
concerned with the social issues of his time. Austen's characters
develop and grow, while Dickens's characters are usually caricatures
and rarely develop or grow. This is why critics comment that her


                              Charles Dickens : David Copperfield / 57
characters are more rounded and true to life, while his characters are
more flat and usually lack depth.


          4.2 Dickens's treatment of characters
                  in David Copperfield
4.2.1     The men characters
 The central character in the novel is David, as all the important
incidents as well as characters revolve around him. He is born six
months after his father's death and is brought up under the loving care
of his mother and nurse Peggotty. After his mother's remarriage, her
new husband Mr. Murdstone ill-treats him. When he protests, as a
punishment he is sent to Salem House, where Mr. Creakle, the
headmaster, bullies and humiliates him. David's childhood is
presented vividly and he is shown as sensitive, honest and loving,
qualities which he retains even after he grows up. He is also intelligent
and observant, but is also too innocent, trusting and thoughtless. He
does not realise that Steerforth is spending his money under the
pretext of taking care of it, and does not see his true colours even
when he sees his behaviour towards Mr. Mell and Rosa Dartle. He
continues to admire him and introduces him to Mr. Peggotty's
household which he ruins, and cannot think badly of him even when
he runs off with Emily. He is often cheated by servants and waiters,
particularly after he marries Dora. This incompetence with servants
indicates that David lacks firmness and self-discipline. In fact, as he
admits, his marriage to Dora is a mistake committed by his
"undisciplined heart", because he falls in love with her at first sight,
before he knows what kind of person she is. This is why, though their
marriage is not an unhappy one, David always feels that something is
missing because Dora is never a companion to him. He is so
shortsighted that he never realises that he cares for Agnes or that she
loves him. This is why, though David is a victim of circumstances, he
is also responsible for much of his unhappiness.
  Though he has many shortcomings, David has many good qualities
that endear him to his friends and relatives. Though he is treated badly
by his stepfather and by Creakle, he preserves his good nature and
humanity and carries with him an atmosphere of cheer and goodwill
wherever he goes. His nurse Peggotty, Ham, Mr. Peggotty and Emily


               English Fiction / 58
all have great affection for him, and even Miss Betsey, who had been
disappointed at his not being a girl, develops love for him. Miss Betsey
advises him never to be mean, vulgar or cruel, and he never forgets
this advice. There is no meanness or pettiness about his conduct. He
is honest, kind and conscientious. He is grateful to Miss Betsey for her
love and kindness, and regards it to be his duty to look after her and
give her moral support when she loses her money. He takes up a job
and works with diligence and sincerity. David is very sensitive, and
responds to the love as well as the insults meted out to him. He is
always loyal to his friends like the Peggottys, the Micawbers,
Steerforth and Traddles. He likes being of service to others eg. he
helps Peggotty to settle her affairs after Barkis's death and helps the
Micawbers to sell their belongings to pay their debts. He is devoted to
Dora, and is never impatient with her inability to deal with housework.
During her illness, he looks after her with great devotion. He loves
Agnes sincerely and proves to be a very good husband to her when
he marries her. David is a gifted young man and has always been fond
of reading. These qualities help him to be a good writer.
    Mr. Micawber is one of the greatest comic characters created by
Dickens. He is a stout, middle-aged person with hardly any hair on his
large, shining head. David lodges with him when he is employed with
Murdstone and Grinby's in London. Mr. Micawber has a big family to
support, and is always in debt. As his debts keep mounting, he sells
off all his household furniture and valuables. In spite of these financial
difficulties, Mr. Micawber is always optimistic. When his creditors are
a bit too pressing, he is full of grief, but soon recovers, and goes out,
humming a tune with more cheer than ever before. Though he is
always in the grip of acute poverty, and just a step away from the
debtor's prison, he has the ability to remain cheerful. He makes
eloquent speeches in a high-flown style. After talking for a few minutes
in a bombastic style, he utters the phrase "in short" and paraphrases
what he has just said in simple language. In spite of his financial
difficulties, Mr. Micawber is always willing to help others. He makes
every possible effort to make David's stay with the family comfortable,
and even when he has to leave the house, he tries to make the best
possible arrangements for him. He comes to Miss Betsey's rescue
when she loses her money to the cunning Uriah Heep, and exposes
the plot thus saving her from disaster. He, along with his wife, is


                             Charles Dickens : David Copperfield / 59
always hoping for something to turn up, and their hopes are realised
when he goes to Australia and becomes a successful magistrate. His
ability to handle Uriah Heep shows that he is an intielligent and
courageous man. When Uriah Heep is being exposed, he tries to
snatch the documents from Mr. Micawber's hands, but the latter is
clever enough to expose his evil designs. He exposes Uriah's plans
very methodically and reads out the charges one by one,
substantiating everything with proof. This shows that he has studied
law and is making good use of it. It is therefore not surprising to hear
about his success in Australia.
  Uriah Heep, Mr. Wickfield's clerk, is the villain of the novel. He
pretends to be humble but actually makes a treacherous plan to
achieve his aim of becoming Wickfield's partner. He is greedy, very
dishonest and nasty. His humility is a mere mask and he is actually
very clever and cunning. He manages to extract information about
Mr.Wickfield's business from David, who is reluctant to part with it. He
employs Mr. Micawber as a clerk, pays him poorly, but lends him
money, so that he can later use him as a clerk. Mr. Wickfield has a
weakness for wine and is grief stricken at his wife's death. Heep
exploits these weaknesses and gradually gains complete control over
his affairs. He studies law so that he may know about legal intricacies
to trap Mr. Wickfield and forges the signatures of both Mr. Wickfield
and Mr. Micawber to draw up documents to achieve his aim. He draws
up a deed in the name of Mr. Wickfield saying that he has left his
business in Heep's hands. He also draws up a bill of sale of Mr.
Wickfield's furniture for which he has to pay Heep an annuity, thus
making him dependent on him. He tries to make him use Miss Betsy's
money for business, but actually pockets it himself. He pretends to
save Mr. Wickfield but actually ruins him. Above all, his ambition is to
one day marry Agnes. He knows this is impossible because he lacks
personality, education, as well as social status, and therefore uses evil
means to realise his ambition.
  Heep's treacherous behaviour brings a lot of suffering to many. Miss
Betsey is almost on the verge of ruin. When Mr. Wickfield realises that
Miss Betsey has lost her money because of him, he experiences
mental strain which affects his health, and Agnes, in turn suffers when
she sees her father's condition. David has to not only discontinue his
studies to take up a job with Dr. Strong, but his marriage with Dora


               English Fiction / 60
also falls into trouble. The only sympathy one feels for him is when he
describes his poor, difficult childhood, when he was forced to learn
how to be humble.
    James Steerforth is an attractive young man who is a senior
student at Salem House where David is sent during holidays as a
punishment for having bitten Mr. Murdstone. He is afraid that the boys,
particularly Steerforth, will ridicule him when they come back. He is
taken before Steerforth as if he is a judge, and is treated with
kindness. David is greatly impressed and Steerforth takes advantage
of this to get hold of David's money and spend it on entertaining the
boys. Though poor David loses whatever little money he had, he is
grateful to Steerforth and looks up to him as his hero. Steerforth is
friendly, gay and has amiable manners, but is selfish and
unscrupulous. He actually comes from a rich family and does not care
for the feelings of poor people, eg. Mr. Mell. Since he is David's friend,
he is invited by Ham and Peggotty to visit them at Yarmouth. There he
meets Emily, who is sweet and innocent, and wants to become a lady.
He seduces her and elopes with her but does not intend to marry her.
Steerforth is also responsible for the tragedy of Rosa Dartle. David
cannot see the reality of Steeforth when he is a child, and sees
through him when it is too late. Steerforth dies a death he deserves
when he is drowned near Yarmouth, the very place he has wronged.
Ham, whose future he has destroyed, tries to rescue him, but is also
drowned.


4.2.2   The women characters
    Dora Copperfield is the daughter of Mr. Spenlow of Doctors
Commons. She is beautiful and good-natured, but empty-headed and
impractical. She charms David from the moment he sees her, but he
realises that everyone treats her like a child, and that she cannot act
responsibly. Her mother died when she was a child, and therefore she
did not have the guidance and correcting influence that could have
made her a better person. Her rich father dotes on her, and she is
surrounded by servants who cater to her every need. This is why she
is immature, cannot fulfill any domestic duties, and is called his child
wife by David. Their married life is rather chaotic because Dora does
not know how to manage household affairs. Their servant is irregular,
irresponsible and in the habit of stealing things. When David advises

                             Charles Dickens : David Copperfield / 61
her to supervise the work, she thinks that he is finding fault with her.
He realises that she is not only unaware if the realities of the world,
but is also incapable of learning them, and if he wants to be happy, he
must accept her as she is. Dora herself is quite conscious that she is
no better than a child, and during her illness realises that she has
been a poor wife to David. She has great admiration for Agnes, who is
an excellent housekeeper and wishes she had learnt from her about
the art of housekeeping.
  Miss Betsey Trotwood is David's great aunt, and is a victim of an
unhappy marriage. Severely disappointed and disillusioned by her
husband, she is strong minded, independent and self-reliant. After
their legal separation and his subsequent death ten years later in
India, she has taken her maiden name again and settled down in a
cottage on the sea-coast at Dover. She lives here with one servant,
Mr. Dick, a middle-aged man of queer habits. She does not approve of
her nephew's marriage to David's mother, and is further disappointed
when David is born because he is not a girl. After his mother's death,
when David is ill-treated by his stepfather and comes to seek shelter
with Miss Betsey, she is at first shocked at his shabby appearance, but
reveals her kind nature when she tries to make him comfortable.
When she decides to adopt him, she calls Mr. and Miss Murdstone,
scolds them for having ill-treated David and his mother, and turns
them out of her house. She arranges for his education, and later his
stay with Mr. Wickfield. She gives him money to visit Peggotty, sends
him on a trip abroad, and pays a large amount to get him articled to
Spenlow and Jorkins. She tells him never to be false or cruel, which
he always remembers. On being convinced that David really loves
Dora, she helps him to win her love, and also helps Dora in her
household affairs. David's marriage to Agnes makes her very happy
because she has great admiration for her. She helps the Micawbers to
emigrate to Australia because she has great sympathy for them.
Above all, she displays tremendous courage when she loses her
fortune. Though she has become eccentric due to the ill treatment she
received at the hands of her husband, David's love restores her to
normalcy.
  Agnes Wickfield is Dickens's idea of idealised womanhood. She is
not only beautiful and attractive, but also modest and self-effacing,
and is a devoted daughter, a faithful friend and a loving wife. She is


               English Fiction / 62
always willing to sacrifice for others. When her mother dies, she
leaves school to look after her father, and though she is in love with
David, she suppresses her love when she comes to know that David
has fallen in love with Dora. She even helps Dora with household work
and takes care of her during her illness. Though at her deathbed Dora
expresses the wish that Agnes should take her place in David's life,
Agnes does not immediately disclose this to him, but tells him to go
abroad and find solace in nature. She reveals Dora's wish to him only
at the appropriate time, when David realises that he loves her and
wants to marry her.
    Mrs. Clara Copperfield is David's mother, a gentle and beautiful
lady who is widowed six months before he is born. Miss Betsey, her
only relative, leaves her because the newborn child is not a girl, and
she is left with only the servant, Clara Peggotty for company. She then
makes the mistake of marrying Mr. Murdstone, a cruel and heartless
man, and is so completely dominated by him and her sister-in-law, that
she becomes deeply unhappy. She does not have the courage to
protest against the indignities heaped on her or their cruelty to David
and dies when he is hardly eight.

          4.3 The structure of David Copperfield
    The     structure   of   David   Copperfield,   determined     by    its
autobiographical form, is a simple one. So it is the story of a part of his
life as he recalls it, beginning from his birth, and continues until the
moment of his writing. David's presence and the events in his life give
the novel coherence. Hence it is his story that is central to the novel
and can be divided into three main parts. The first part (Chapters 1 to
18) consists of an account of the circumstances of his birth, childhood
and early youth. In the first two chapters he tells us about his birth and
early impressions of his time with his mother and Pegotty. The next


                              Charles Dickens : David Copperfield / 63
few chapters tell us about his misery after his mother marries Mr.
Murdstone, her death and his misery thereafter. He then tells us about
his experience at Murdstone and Grinby's, his stay with the
Micawbers, his going to Miss Betsey and education at Dr. Strong's
school. The second part (Chapters 19 to 53) is about his later youth
and early manhood, when he looks for a career, his courtship and
marriage to Dora and her death. The third part (Chapters 54 to 64),
which tells about his mourning for Dora and ends with his marriage to
Agnes. Each of the parts ends with a 'Retrospect' chapter that
summarises the events taking place over a long period of time. There
are two other sub-plots which are woven around David's story. One
concerns Mr. Wickfield, Uriah Heep and Mr.Micawber. The second one
is about the Peggotty family, Emily and Steerforth. The two stories
balance one another. The Heep story has a happy ending, because
Mr. Wickfield recovers, Heep is exposed and defeated, and
everyone's fortune is restored. Steerforth's story ends tragically,
because though Mr. Peggotty recovers Emily, Steerforth and Ham are
drowned. There are other smaller stories like the story of Miss Betsey
and her husband, of the Strong family, and of the Micawber family, and
David is in some way connected with the characters in each story.

     4.4 Humour and pathos in David Copperfield
  There is humour in abundance in David Copperfield, and this is
humour of character, humour of situation, as well as humour of
dialogue. Critics have often compared Mr. Micawber to Shakespeare's
Falstaff. His stout figure, shiny bald head, and above all his hope that
something will turn up, are all a source of amusement. One moment
he wants to slash his throat to kill himself, and is humming a tune the
next. Miss Betsey creates humour because she is always seen


               English Fiction / 64
chasing donkeys and is constantly afraid of fire in London. Others like
Mr. Dick, Barkis, or Mr. Spenlow, also create humour through their
eccentricities. Many episodes in the novel are also a source of
amusement. eg. when David is cheated by the waiter, or when Barkis
indicates his wish to marry Peggotty. Dialogues become a source of
humour in the novel because as usual, Dickens has given his comic
characters a distinct manner of speech. eg., Mr. Micawber's
grandiloquent speeches, or Miss Betsey's abrupt way of talking.
 Dickens has often been criticised for being melodramatic and over
sentimental. Some incidents in David Copperfield are genuinely
pathetic eg. David's ill-treatment by the Murdstones, the death of his
mother, or his suffering at the blacking factory. But this effect is spoilt
by other scenes which are melodramatic and overdo the pathos. eg.
the death of Dora's dog Jip when she dies, the death of Ham, or
Steerforth's body being washed to the shore to lie at David's feet.
Undoubtedly, such incidents detract from the effect of those where
Dickens depicts true emotions with restraint and simplicity.

 4.4 Check Your Progress.
     Fill in the blanks :-
 a) Dickens creates humour through ______ ,______ , and ______
 b) Three humorous characters in David Copperfield are ____,
    ____ and ____.


             4.5 The unity of David Copperfield
    Some critics have commented that David Copperfield lacks unity.
We have seen earlier that it is a carefully constructed novel in which
the main plot and the sub-plots are arranged to form a well-organised
whole. So it would not be correct to say that parts of the novel have
nothing to do with the main story of David's life. eg. the stories of Miss
Betsey and her husband, or of Doctor and Annie Strong. But David
learns from both about the meaning of true love and what makes a
happy marriage. Hence, if love and marriage are regarded as
important themes in the novel, then the unity of the novel is clearly
seen. Another fact which contributes to the unity of the novel is the
autobiographical element and the first person narration. The novel is
the story of David's life, his development and progress from birth to the


                             Charles Dickens : David Copperfield / 65
present, and this also contributes in making the novel an integrated
whole.


                          4.6 Conclusion
  While reading David Copperfield, one has to keep in mind that it was
written almost midway in his literary career, and shows the ease of his
early work as well as the sense of design of his later writing. The
autobiographical narrative gave the advantages of allowing the story
to stretch over a long period with David as the common link between
the episodes and the characters, as well as for better development of
characters. There is also a greater sense of realism since many of the
incidents have been taken from his own life. eg. his suffering at the
blacking factory, his infatuation with Dora, etc. Like many novels of this
period, this one was also first published in serial form. So he had to
keep the reader's interest alive, remind him about earlier episodes and
characters, and at the same time overcome these problems with a
carefully constructed story.
 In the next chapter, we have to study George Eliot's Middlemarch ,
which was also written during the Victorian period and was also first
published in serial form. In spite of this, it is, as we shall see, quite
different from Dickens's novel.


                           4.7 Summary
  In the beginning, we come to know about Dickens and his
background. Then We come to know about the main characters and
the unique way in which Dickens depicts them. We also find a brief
analysis of the structure of the novel, as also Dickens's method of
depicting humour and pathos. The question of whether the novel has
unity of form is also touched upon.

        George Eliot : Middlemarch


Introduction to George Eliot and her novels
     Mary Ann Evans, better known as George Eliot, was born in
Warwickshire, in 1819 and spent the early years of her life with her
father an estate agent, and her brother, Isaac. From childhood, she
showed an unusual aptitude for study and was far ahead of her
brother in academic achievements. At the age of twenty-two, she went
with her father to Coventry, and soon began to free herself from the
narrow religious outlook which bound her family. She later came into
contact with thinkers like Francis Newman, Herbert Spencer and was
deeply influenced by their philosophy. She then met George Henry
Lewes, and defying Victorian convention, lived with him for the rest of
her life. Poverty and misfortune dogged them for a while, but Lewes
recognised her superior intellect and encouraged her with praise and
devotion. Inspired by him, in 1857, she wrote Scenes from Clerical
Life. Adam Bede appeared in 1859, and The Mill on the Floss, which
is largely autobiographical, in 1860. Both the novels were very well
acclaimed as also her Silas Marner (1861), Romola (1863), Felix Holt
(1866), Middlemarch (1871-72), and Daniel Deronda (1873).
    Of all the women novelists of the 19th century, George Eliot was
the most learned and in her creative achievement, the most adult. She
was a rationalist, and what interested her above all, were the human
motives that she tried to explore and comprehend. She tried to analyse
the thoughts of her characters, to probe their deepest desires, and
while doing so, displays a deep compassion and understanding of
human nature. Thus, George Eliot's novels contain numerous
examples of subtle psychological study.




                                George Eliot : Middlemarch / 69
Summary of Middlemarch
  Dorothea Brooke and her younger sister, Ceila were young women
of good birth, who lived with their bachelor uncle at Tipton Grange
near the town of Middlemarch. So serious was Dorothea's cast of mind
that she was reluctant to keep jewelry she had inherited from her dead
mother, and she gave all of it to her sister. Upon reconsideration,
however, she did keep a ring and a bracelet. At a dinner party where
Edward Casaubon, a middle-aged scholar, and Sir James Chettam
both vied for her attention, she was much more attracted to the
serious-minded Casaubon. Casaubon must have had inkling that his
chances with Dorothea were good, for the next morning he sought her
out. Ceila, who did not like his complexion or his moles, disapproved
of the matter. That afternoon Dorothea, contemplating the wisdom of
the scholar, was walking and by chance encountered Sir James who
was in love with her and mistook her silence for and supposed she
might love him in return. When Casaubon made his proposal of
marriage by letter, Dorothea accepted him at once. Mr. Brooke, her
uncle, thought Sir James a much better match; Dorothea's acceptance
merely confirmed his bachelor views that women were difficult to
understand. He decided not to interfere in her plans, but Celia felt that
the event would be more like a funeral than a marriage, and frankly
said so.
  Casaubon took Dorothea, Celia, and Mr. Brooke to see his home so
that Dorothea might order any necessary changes. Dorothea,
intending in all things to defer to Casaubon's tastes, said she would
make no changes in the house. During the visit Dorothea met Will
Ladislaw, Casaubon's second cousin, who seemed to be hardly in
sympathy with his elderly cousin's marriage plans. While Dorothea
and her new husband were travelling in Italy, Tertius Lydgate, an
ambitious and poor young doctor, was meeting pretty Rosamond
Vincy, to whom he was much attracted. Fred Vincy, Rosamond's
brother, had indicated that he expected to come into a fine inheritance
when his uncle, Mr. Featherstone, should die. Vincy, meanwhile, was
pressed by a debt he was unable to pay.
  Lydgate became involved in petty local politics. When the time came
to choose a chaplain for the new hospital of which Lydgate was the
head, the young doctor realised that it was to his best interest to vote
in accordance with the wishes of Nicholas Bulstrode, an influential

               English Fiction / 70
banker and founder of the hospital. A clergyman man named Tyke
received the office. In Rome, Ladislaw encountered Dorothea had
begun to realise too late how pompous and incompatible she found
Casaubon. Seeing her unhappiness, Ladislaw first pitied and then fell
in love with his cousin's wife. Unwilling to live any longer on
Casaubon's charity, Ladislaw announced his intention of returning to
England and finding some kind of gainful occupation.
    When Fred Vincy's note came due, he tried to sell a horse at a
profit but the animal tried to be vicious. Caleb Garth, who had signed
his note, now stood to lose a hundred and ten pounds because of
Fred's inability to raise the money. Fred fell ill, and Lydgate was
summoned to attend him. Lydgate used his professional calls to further
his suit with Rosamond. Dorothea and her husband returned from
Rome in time to hear of Celia's engagement to Sir James Chettam.
Will Ladislaw included a note to Dorothea in a letter he wrote to
Casaubon. This attention precipitated a quarrel which was followed
by Casaubon's serious illness. Lydgate, who attended him, urged him
to give up his studies for the time being. To Dorothea, Lydgate
confided that Casaubon had a weak heart and must be guarded from
all excitement.
    Meanwhile all the relatives of old Mr. Featherstone were waiting
impatiently for his death, but he hoped to circumvent their desires by
giving his fortune to Mary Garth, daughter of the man who had signed
Fred Vincy's note. When she refused it, he fell into a rage and died
soon afterwards. When his will was read, it was learned he had left
nothing to his relatives; most of his money was to go to a Joshua
Riggs, who was to take the name of Featherstone and a part of his
fortune was to endow the Featherstone Almshouses for old men. Plans
were made for Rosamond's marriage with Lydgate. Fred Vincy was
ordered to prepare himself finally for the ministry, since he was to
have no inheritance from his uncle. Mr. Brooke, having gone into
politics, enlisted the help of Ladislaw in publishing a liberal paper.
Mr. Casaubon had come to dislike Ladislaw intensely after his cousin
had rejected further assistance, and he had forbidden Ladislaw to
enter his house. Casaubon died suddenly
    A codicil to his will gave Dorothea all of his property as long as
she did not marry Ladislaw. This strange provision caused Dorothea's
friends and relatives some concern because if publicly given out, it

                               George Eliot : Middlemarch / 71
would appear that Dorothea and Ladislaw had been indiscreet.
  Mr. Brooke, on the advice of his Tory friends, gave up his liberal
newspaper and thus cut off his connection with Ladislaw. The latter
realised that Dorothea's family was in some way trying to separate
him from Dorothea but he refused to be disconcerted about the matter.
He resolved to stay on in Middlemarch until he was ready to leave.
When he heard of the codicil to Casaubon's will, he was more than
ever determined to remain so that he could eventually disprove the
suspicions of the village concerning him and Dorothea. Meanwhile
Lydgate and Rosamond had married, and the doctor had gone deeply
in debt to furnish his house. When he found that his income did not
meet his wife's spendthrift habits, he asked her to help him economize.
He and his wife began to quarrel. His practice and popularity
decreased.
   A disreputable man named Raffles appeared in Middlemarch.
Raffles knew that Ladislaw's grandfather had amassed a fortune as a
receiver of stolen goods and that Nicholas Bulstrode, the highly
respected banker, had once been the confidential clerk of Ladislaw's
ancestor. More than that, Bulstrode's first wife had been his
employer's widow. Upon money inherited from her, money which
should have gone to Ladislaw's mother, Bulstrode had built his own
fortune. Already blackened by Raffles, Bulstrode reasoned that the
scoundrel would tell Ladislaw the whole story. To forestall trouble, he
sent for Ladislaw and offered him an annuity of five hundred pounds
and liberal provision in his will. Ladislaw, feeling that his relatives
had already tainted his honour, refused, unwilling to be associated in
any way with the unsavory business. Deciding to leave Middlemarch,
Ladislaw went to London without assurance that Dorothea loved him.
Lydgate drifted deeper into debt. When he wished to sell what he could
and take cheaper lodgings, Rosamond managed to make him hold on,
to keep up the pretense of prosperity a little longer. At the same time
Bulstrode gave up his interest in the new hospital and withdrew his
financial support. Faced at last with the seizure of his goods, Lydgate
went to Bulstrode and asked for a loan. The banker advised him to
seek aid from Dorothea and abruptly ended the conversation. But
when Raffles, in the last stages of alcoholism, returned to
Middlemarch and Lydgate was called in to attend him, Bulstrode,
afraid the doctor would learn the banker's secret from Raffles'


               English Fiction / 72
drunken ravings, changed his mind and gave Lydgate a cheque for a
thousand pounds. The loan came in time to save Lydgate's goods and
reputation. When Raffles died, Bulstrode felt at peace at last. But it
soon became common gossip that Bulstrode had given money to
Lydgate and that Lydgate had attended Raffles in his final illness.
Bulstrode and Lydgate were publicly accused of malpractice in
Raffles' death. Only Dorothea took up Lydgate's defense. The rest of
the town was busy with gossip over the affair. Rosamond was anxious
to leave Middlemarch to avoid public disgrace. Bulstrode also was
anxious to leave the town after his secret, which Raffles had told while
drunk in a neighbouring village, became known. But he became ill and
his doctors would not permit him to leave his bed. Dorothea,
sympathetic with Lydgate, determined to give her support to the
hospital and to try to convince Rosamond that the only way Lydgate
could recover his honour was by remaining in Middlemarch.
Unfortunately, she came upon Will Ladislaw, to whom poor Rosamond
was pouring out her grief. Afraid Rosamond was involved with
Ladislaw, Dorothea left abruptly. Angered at the false position
Rosamond had put him in, Ladislaw explained that he had always
loved Dorothea, but from a distance. When Dorothea forced herself to
return to Lydgate's house on the following morning, Rosamond told
her of Ladislaw's declaration. Dorothea realised she was willing to
give up Casaubon's fortune for Ladislaw's affection.
    Inspite of the protests of her family and friends, they were married
several weeks later and went to live in London. Lydgate and
Rosamond lived together with better understanding and prospects of a
happier future. Fred Vincy became engaged to Mary Garth, with
whom he had long been in love. For a long time Dorothea's family
disregarded her, but they were finally reconciled after Dorothea's son
was born and Ladislaw was elected to Parliament

                         5.1 Introduction
  George Eliot is also a novelist who wrote in the 18th century in
England. But unlike Dickens, her characters are more rounded and
develop and grow throughout the novel. She presents them from a
psychological point of view, and is often regarded as among the
earliest modern novelists. Also, in Middlemarch she not only mentions
but also writes in the context of contemporary historical developments
like the Reform Bill. She is also unique in the fact that her novel is
infused not only with a moral vision but also with a deep sense of
compassion.

        5.2 The Social Background of The Novel
    Middlemarch is concerned with the time period of about two and a
half decades, beginning with the 1920s. The period covered is one in
which there were many political reforms the most significant of which
was the Reform Bill of 1832. Other factors like the increase in the
number of factories and the coming of the railways suggest that it was
a society undergoing rapid change. Though the landed gentry still
commanded the most respect, other professions were gaining
prominence, e.g. doctors (apothecaries, physicians, surgeons),
lawyers, traders, etc. It was a very class-conscious society, in which
those of noble birth were stilt the highest on the social ladder, and
where there was a gulf between the town and the country. Man had to
function and interact among institutions like the church, marriage,
money, politics, and labour. All these had a strong moral thread
running through them, and George Eliot has interwoven it with the
stories and characters to bring about the best possible effect.
   Women occupied an inferior position in society. They were
expected to remain in the background and fulfil their domestic duties,
and did not have any say in legal or property matters. They were not
expected to be intelligent or assertive, but ornamental as well as
useful. All these factors give the reader the impression that individual
lives were influenced by their personal choices, but also the socio-
economic factors prevalent during the time.


    5.3 George Eliot's Treatment of Her Characters
5.3.1   The men Characters
   Casaubon is a cold and remote figure, at pains to give an
impression of dignity and learning. Celia sees through his
pretentiousness and finds him ugly and pompous, but poor deluded
Dorothea is taken in by his reserve into thinking that this vain, dry
clergyman is an intellectual, a man of letters. He imagines that in
Dorothea he has found a suitable wife as she will admire him, and be
a wife, hostess and secretary. He cannot understand her ardour and
enthusiasm because he is unemotional and self-occupied. Her
intelligence and perception that he himself distrusts his ability to
complete his work makes him conscious of his failure. His resentment
at this realisation makes him retire deeper into his shell and he is a


                                George Eliot : Middlemarch / 75
very lonely man. Casaubon's jealousy towards Ladislaw arises out of
his feelings of inadequacy - Ladislaw is everything he is not, viz.
young, enthusiastic, and above all unafraid. His will is another
example of his jealousy and possessiveness, because he dimly
foresees the possibility of Dorothea marrying Ladislaw, and wishes to
prevent it even after his death.
  Unlike Casaubon, Lydgate's intelligence and learning are genuine.
Like Dorothea, he is a person who holds great promise but has to rest
content with very ordinary achievements. As a surgeon with excellent
training, who hopes to combine medical work with research in
physiology, he is undoubtedly above ordinary people in intelligence
and work. But he is very conscious of this and it is this consciousness
as well as his materialistic tendencies make him a lesser individual.
Lydgate's affair with the French actress, and his marriage to
Rosamond indicate that he seems to have a weakness for vain,
beautiful women. But his good nature is genuine as is seen in his
relationship with his patients and colleagues. Success, recognition,
prestige, are very important to him, but he is not aggressive, hard, or
tough. In fact, he is swayed by sentiments and also suffers from pangs
of conscience e.g. when he accepts money from Bulstrode. When he
falls in love with Rosamond, he does not see through her wiles, and it
is only after their marriage that he realises that under her beauty He
selfishness and a terrible obstinacy. He forgives Rosamond for her
petty scheming and becomes resigned to her egoism and her
determination to have her own way. When Lydgate fails to achieve his
ambition of being an affluent, renowned surgeon, he is bitterly
disillusioned and resorts to dishonesty and the fear of exposure
haunts him. It is particularly important for him to present the image of
a respectable man of medicine, since a good reputation will help him
to further his career by establishing a good practice in elite society.
  Will Ladislaw is the representative of the world outside Middlemarch,
and the anti-thesis of Casaubon, being unlike him in all possible ways.
He is the grandson of a woman who rebelled against the Casaubon
values of class and money. His father was a musician, mother an
actress, while he is a dilettante and a Radical. He rejects the
superficial liberalism of Mr. Brooke and has not yet found his vocation.
He sympathizes with Dorothea and regards her marriage to Mr.
Casaubon as a horrible sacrifice, and later falls in love with her himself


               English Fiction / 76
5.3.2   The women Characters
     George Eliot's Middlemarch is well-acclaimed for her
compassionate delineation of character and subtlety of psychological
analysis. Dorothea Brooke is a fine instance of this. Little information
is given about the environment in which she grows up. She is deprived
of the security of a happy family as her parents are dead, and Mr.
Brooke, the only substitute for parents, is a tolerant uncle who lets
everyone have their way because opposition causes him too much
trouble. Dorothea is an idealist, and her idealism is misplaced
because she wants to do good and great things in a world of which
she is ignorant. She is a misfit in the narrow provincial society where
women were expected to be submissive and accept the role assigned
to them without aspiring for more. She has visions of being the partner
in the accomplishment of a great work and her misguided notions lead
her into committing the grave mistake of marrying Casaubon. Her
childlike ideas about marriage (that a husband could be "a sort of
father" ), and her inability to see the obvious (Casaubon, who is ugly
to Celia, seems to be one of the most distinguished-looking men to
Dorothea) bring about disillusionment and unhappiness to her. She
wants to be needed and appreciated by Casaubon, because he is the
only person she looks up to - she feels that other people are ordinary
and mediocre. This wish remains unfulfilled because Casaubon is
always aloof and unapproachable, and Dorothea is doomed to a life of
loneliness and misery. With the death of Casaubon comes the final
blow, the codicil to the will, which is the ultimate insult she has to bear.
Her marriage to the quite ordinary Will Ladislaw and willingness to
give up Casaubon's property, is clearly an attempt to come out of her
loneliness and establish a close relationship with another human
being. Giving up her noble ideals of doing good and great things, she
settles down to a fife of humdrum domesticity.
    Rosamond is a self-centered product of a ladies academy, the
spoilt daughter of the complacent Vincy family. She is discontented
with the narrow dull life of Middlemarch and treats her eager suitors
with contempt because her heart is set on getting away to London. In
her hauteur and disdain, she deliberately remains aloof from the
people around her, whom she regards as commonplace and
unrefined. In this she is somewhat similar to Dorothea who also
regards herself as superior to others, but whereas Dorothea is a victim


                                  George Eliot : Middlemarch / 77
of deluded and impractical ideas, Rosamond is deliberately selfish
and calculating. The arrival of Lydgate arouses her interest because
she hears of his connection with an aristocratic family. Marriage to him
is her means of escaping from an environment unsuited to her
supposedly superior accomplishments to a life of social importance.
She is determined to marry him and sets out to charm him by showing
off her petty talents. Rosamond's obstinacy, which George Eliot at first
only hints at, is seen clearly once she is engaged to Lydgate. She is
soon disillusioned with Lydgate when she sees that their marital life is
troubled by financial problems. Later, she flirts with Ladislaw because
it diverts her mind from her displeasure with Lydgate. Though she is
not unfaithful to her husband, she wants to keep other men to herself
as her admirers. Lydgate's resentment and jealousy are seen by her
as a tribute to her womanhood and personal charm. As their marriage
deteriorates further, Lydgate sees her obstinacy, her inability to accept
reality, her extravagance, and her air of martyrdom and disdain if she
does not get her own way. As Lydgate's troubles increase, so does
Rosamond's lack of concern for them. Rosamond almost destroys the
relationship between Dorothea and Ladislaw, but later behaves unlike
her usual self by telling Dorothea about the nature of Ladislaw's visit
to her, thereby clearing the way for their love. This is one rare instance
when she moves out of her selfishness to help a fellow-woman in
trouble. But soon she goes back to her usual stand of selfishness and
obstinacy, and this is why Lydgate calls her his "basil plant".

             5.4 The structure of Middlemarch
  Middlemarch is often praised for its sense of unity despite its vast
canvas, numerous characters and their individual stories. George Eliot
is said to have started on a story with Lydgate as the central character


               English Fiction / 78
and concerned with the fictional town which gave it its title. She then
started on a separate work called "Miss Brooke", which grew in
complexity. She must have recognised the many similarities of theme
and setting and by 1871 the two stories were fused into a single
panoramic novel. At the heart of the novel we have these two stories
of Dorothea and Lydgate, twin studies in defeated aspiration.
Dorothea, the misguided idealist, anxious to do great good in a world
that is too narrow for her, is trapped in a marriage to the pedantic
Casaubon. Lydgate, who aspires to achieve glorious heights in
medical research, also fails to fulfil his dreams, and has an unhappy
marriage with the self-centered Rosamond. Interwoven into these
main stories, are those of Bulstrode, banker and religious hypocrite,
whose dishonest past betrays him; of Fred Vincy, good-natured but
lazy, who is saved by his love for Mary Garth, and the example of her
father, Caleb; of Featherstone's disposition of his property; and
several minor characters who give range and depth to the novel. One
or more of the characters in each story plays an important part in each
of the other stories, thus making the novel an integrated whole.

      5.5 Middlemarch as a study of provincial life
                in 18th century England
   The main concern of Middlemarch is with the society of provincial
England just before the Reform Bill of 1832, which was a rather
cramped and narrow society. The political climate brought together,
though only temporarily, people of different classes, viz., doctor,
banker, businessman, cleric, baronet, etc. This is a society in which
birth, rank and class are central. Rosamond does not have the same
social status as the Miss Brookes, and though Chettam and Mr.Brooke
recognize Mr. Vincy as a mayor, they cannot recognize his family.
Chettam disapproves of Dorothea's marriage to Ladislaw, does his


                                George Eliot : Middlemarch / 79
best to hinder it and is only reconciled when Celia pressurizes him
after Dorothea has a baby. At the same time, the Vincys look down on
the Garths because Fred is a university man, while Mary is a
governess and teacher. In this society, money rules, whether it is
inherited or acquired, as is seen by the position enjoyed by Mr.
Brooke, Bulstrode and Featherstone. Lydgate represents the new
professional man having ideals and an enlightened attitude that
threatens the position of the traditional practitioners who want to
continue with their traditional methods as well as their malpractices.
George Eliot comments on the narrowness of provincial society by
depicting the amount of gossip generated from the criticism of
Casaubon by Mrs. Cadwallader to the people's condemnation of
Lydgate and Bulstrode without proof.

     5.6 Some prominent themes in Middlemarch
  While reading the novel, some themes appear to be prominent.
Foremost among these is the theme of defeated aspirations, of which
Dorothea and Lydgate are the best examples. Both want to do great
things in life but their movements are cramped in the narrow provincial
society of Middlemarch. George Eliot makes use of such parallels as
well as of contrasts to highlight the themes. The theme of love and
marriage is also an important one in the novel. The Dorothea-
Casaubon marriage and the Rosamond-Lydgate marriage are
examples of failed marriages, as the Celia-Chettam marriage, the
Dorothea-Ladislaw marriage and the Fred-Mary marriage are
examples of successful ones. The search for one's true vocation and
the ways in which this may be frustrated is seen in the stories of
Dorothea and Lydgate, and also in the examples of Casaubon,
Farebrother and Fred.
  The moral theme dominates the novel, as can be seen in the various
stories. Thus Mr. Brooke lives in leisure and fails to reform his own


                English Fiction / 80
estates while preaching to others, but is confronted by angry tenants
like Dagley. Bulstrode can buy his way on to committees or Stone
Court, but cannot buy Caleb Garth or even Raffles. Featherstone can
buy sycophancy and subservience but not integrity. Fred resists
temptation to follow the work ethics of the Garths. Lydgate is caught
in the money trap and has to pay the price for falling into it.
Casaubon's forgiveness of Dorothea is cold and distant and far from
Christian charity. Farebrother has the honesty to admit to Lydgate that
he doubts whether the ministry is his true vocation .Farebrother and
Mary Garth clearly have the author's approval and are the type of
characters who set the standard for the others in the novel.


                         5.7 Conclusion
    Throughout the novel, the voice of the narrator is very obvious
because besides being omniscient, it makes moral judgements on all
events and people. George Eliot is impartial in analyzing Dorothea
and Lydgate as well as Bulstrode and Casaubon, and her comments
are ironic as well as compassionate. Her characters make a
psychological journey from delusion to self-realization, and it is to her
credit that she makes it a very realistic one for the reader. Joseph
Conrad, the novelist we will study in the next chapter, also continues
with this realism by creating characters who are true to life, though his
technique is a very different one.


                           5.8 Summary
    After some information regarding George Eliot and her literary
career, we read a synopsis of Middlemarch . A brief survey of the
social background of the age enabled us to get an idea of the canvas
on which George Eliot draws her narrative. Her treatment of the men
characters as well as the women characters shows her insight into
human nature as well as her feeling of compassion towards all. The
analysis of the structure of Middlemarch shows that though the novel
appears to be rather unwieldy, it is carefully constructed with the two
main stories of Dorothea and Lydgate being closely woven with the
various sub-plots. Then we saw how the novel is a study of provincial
life in 18th century England through the distinctions in social class and



                                 George Eliot : Middlemarch / 81
rank in society as reflected in the story. George Eliot touches upon
several themes in the novel eg., those of defeated aspirations, love,
marriage, etc.

Thomas Hardy : Jude The Obscure

Introduction to Thomas Hardy
     Thomas Hardy was born in Dorchester in 1840. In 1862, he went
to London as an assistant in an architect's office. He had a liking for
literature and read works of contemporary writers like T. H. Huxley,
Swinburne, and Browning. He wrote Under the Greenwood Tree in
1872 and Far from the Madding Crowd in 1874, which were very
popular. During the next ten years, he and his wife travelled in Britain
and abroad and made their home in the country though they went to
London at intervals. His The Return of the Native was published in
1678, The Mayor of Casterbridge in 1886, Tess of the D'UrbcrviUes
in 1891, and Jude the Obscure in 1896. Hardy had always been
sensitive to criticism, and the damning reception of his last novel upset
him so deeply, that he gave up novel-writing. He devoted himself to the
preparation of his epic drama, The Dynasts, which was published in
1904, and after that wrote only poetry until his death in 1928.


Summary of Jude The Obscure
     The novel opens in a small village in Wessex, with the departure of
the village schoolmaster, Mr. Phillotson, and the author tells us that
everybody in the village seemed sorry to see him leave. He is going to
the city of Christminster, some twenty miles away. Jude Fawley, a little
boy of eleven, who is the central figure in the novel, is very sorry to
see him leave because they have been good friends. Though he is very
young, Jude is one of the few who understand why the school master
is leaving. The school master is leaving for Christminster because he
wishes to get a university degree which is necessary for a man who
wants to do in teaching. As Phillotson leaves the village Jude is rudely
woken from thinking about his ambitious teacher by the loud voice of
his aunt, an old woman who is bringing up the orphaned Jude and
who lives in a small cottage with Jude. Jude is ordered to go to the


                             Thomas Hardy : Jude The Obscure / 87
well in the centre of village, and fetch two water buckets back to his
aunt's cottage. The old lady, Drusilla Fawley, earns her living as a
baker. As the first chapter closes, Jude arrives at the old well. Jude
returns to great-aunt Drusilla's cottage with the two heavy water
buckets; this is physical labour really beyond the boy's strength, but he
is not one to complain. He finds himself listening to a conversation
between his aunt and another elderly woman, Mrs. Williams, and
Drusilla tells the story of Jude and his parents to Mrs. Williams right
in front of Jude. The story Drusilla tells is one of the tragic and
untimely death of both of Jude's parents, after what was apparently a
very unhappy marriage ending with their separation and then their
death. She does not go into detail, but she warns Jude not to marry
because it is not correct for the Fawleys to marry. As she tells the
villagers as well as Jude something of the family history and its
misfortunes, she also makes it known that Jude, like most of his family,
is very much attracted to books. She wishes that the schoolmaster
would have taken Jude off her hands and made a scholar of him in the
university at Christminster, but he was not to be. The old woman
mentions Jude's cousin, Sue, who had been born in Drusilla's own
cottage, as having many of the same characteristics as Jude,
especially her love for books. Jude feels a sense of identity with the
birds, because nobody wants them, just as he feels that nobody wants
him. Drusilla tells Jude more about Christminster and wishes that he
had also gone there so that he would have been off her hands. Jude
now begins to wish he could really go to Christminster, which has
become his goal and aspiration. Jude meets a man with a coal-cart
who tells him that they have come for Christminster where there are
many scholars and clergymen. This increases Jude's appetite for study
at Christminster. Then Jude meets Physician Vilbert, a quack doctor
who sells worthless medicines to trusting and ignorant rural people.
Jude questions him about Christminster and the physician gives the
impression that he is a university graduate. He tells Jude that he will
give him the grammars of Latin and Greek, which are necessary for
entrance into the university if Jude will get some customers for him.
Jude honestly does so, and then realises that the physician is a
dishonest man. He is really disillusioned and feels really depressed.
During the next three or four years Jude studies hard along with the
work of helping his aunt. One Saturday, as Jude is returning home, he


               English Fiction / 88
hears the voices of some girls from the other side of the hedge.
Suddenly he is hit with something which is the part of an animal's
body. He peeps over the hedge and sees three young women washing
parts of animals' bodies. One of them, a fine dark-eyed girl catches his
attention and later, he comes to know that her name is Arabella. He
decides to call upon her the next Sunday. Jude wants to break his date
with Arabella but cannot make himself do so. Arabella tempts him and
Jude seduces her. Two months later her he tells her that he plans to go
and begin his career at Christminster. She consults the quack doctor
Vilbert and tells Jude that she is pregnant with his child. Though he
knows it is a mistake, Jude and Arabella are married and he tries to
convince himself that she is the right person. Jude is nineteen, an
apprentice stone-mason with poor financial prospects. He takes a
small cottage where Arabella can wait for the expected child. But she
tells him that she is mistaken about the pregnancy and that there is to
be no child. He comes to know other things about her namely that she
has been a barmaid, she wears a wig, that she lied to him about her
pregnancy - all of which cause him to give less respect to her. The
incident of the slaughtering of the pig reveals that Arabella is cold and
unemotional about the killing while Jude is soft-hearted. Jude
overhears a conversation between Arabella's companions and
discovers in which Arabella trapped him and on going home speaks to
her about it. Arabella's reaction is to say that every woman has a right
to behave in such a way and after that to antagonize Jude by throwing
his books on the floor and smearing them with grease. Jude uses
physical force to stop her and Arabella walks out on the road shouting
to the passers-by that she was being ill-treated by him. Several days
later he receives a letter from her telling him that she is planning to
emigrate to Australia with her parents. He sees that Arabella has
auctioned of his portrait with the rest of the household goods and after
buying it burns it as a sign that their relationship is finished. He
decides to go to Christminster and forget his marriage to Arabella.
    In Part II of the book, Hardy tells us that Jude goes to
Christminster, which is the place of his dreams. He is twenty-two years
old, has been married and separated, and is experienced in stone-
cutting and stone-carving. Jude had seen at his aunt's house the
photograph of his cousin, Sue Bridehead, who lives in Christminster.
Jude walks around Christminster and sees the names of great poets


                             Thomas Hardy : Jude The Obscure / 89
and writers associated with the college. For a number of days, he
wanders around the colleges among the students and realises that he
has little chance of becoming a university student. He gets
employment at the stone-mason yard, rents a small room and buys a
few books intending to study by night and work by day. He comes to
know the place where Sue is employed and goes there to observe her.
Next Sunday, Jude attends a church service because he knows that Sue
often attends it. When he sees her he follows her and sees her buying
plaster statues but he does not speak to her. At last Jude and Sue meet
and Jude admits that he knows a great deal about her. She tells him
that his school teacher, Phillotson, is now a schoolmaster in a small
town outside Christminster. He meets Phillotson who tells her that he
has given up his ideas of getting a degree and Jude wonders how he
can succeed when Phillotson has been a failure. Meanwhile, Sue has
left her employment and becomes the assistant teacher to Phillotson.
She is quite good at her work and he wishes to keep her services. Jude
looks forward to his next meeting with Sue but he sees her walking
with Phillotson and is overcome with jealousy but he tells himself that
he is still legally Arabella's husband to marry Sue would be a criminal
and moral offence. Then he comes to know that his aunt Drusilla is ill
and goes to see her. When he speaks to her about Sue, she wants him
not to have anything to do with Sue. Jude returns to Christminster and
decides to go to see Sue. He goes to her cottage and tells her all he
has done to himself and his reputation. Sue is sympathetic and allows
him to sleep downstairs in the house. He leaves the cottage before Sue
wakes up and goes to his aunt's house, where he talks to the curate
who has been comforting her in her in her illness.
  Part III shows Jude temporarily abandoning the world to lead a
religious life because he would never rise above the rank of a humble
curate and this, he feels, would be purgatory that he deserved for his
previous sinful life. He is considered a failure by the villagers because
he went to Christminster to better himself but returns without any
achievement. Jude receives a letter from Sue in which she asks him to
come and see her as she is very lonely, and that she does not like the
college because she hates the confinement. Jude goes to meet her and
she tells him that Phillotson has proposed to her and that she has
accepted. One afternoon Sue having a half-day's leave from her strict
college, goes with Jude on a visit near Melchester. They are stranded


               English Fiction / 90
and a kind shepherd gives them shelter for the night. When she returns
to college the next morning, she is severely reprimanded. That
evening, Sue comes to Jude's lodgings and stays the night. She tells
him (with a total lack of emotion), of her friendship with a student who
had ultimately died of a broken heart because she had refused to be
his mistress. In the morning, Sue leaves the house with Jude, and
thinking that they are unobserved, plans to return to college and be
readmitted. But the college authorities refuse to take her back, and
suggest that she marry Jude for the sake of her reputation. In the
meanwhile, Phillotson is decorating a house in preparation of his
marriage to Sue. She does not inform him about her expulsion, and he
is shocked to know of it when he visits the college. He meets Jude, who
tells him that Sue is innocent, and that he would like to marry Sue but
cannot. Afterwards Jude meets Sue and tells her that he is married to
Arabella and is upset that he had not told her about this earlier. Jude
tells her that the Fawleys were not meant for marriage, but she makes
light of this prophecy. Sue marries Phillotson, and Jude gives her
away at the wedding, but he feels that she is making a ghastly mistake.
Jude goes to see his aunt who is very ill, and then proceeds to
Christminster, where he is offered a job. To his surprise, he sees
Arabella, working as a barmaid. They go to stay at an inn, and the
next morning, she tells him that she has married another man in
Australia. They visit Drusilla, who seems to be better, and then
Arabella shocks him by telling him that she is going back to her
second husband in Australia. Jude returns to his studies for priesthood
and after some days, receives an invitation from Sue for dinner to their
house, but declines to go.
    Jude meets Sue at the school and she invites him again, but later,
she sends a note cancelling it. Jude receives a telegram saying that his
aunt is dying, and by the time he reaches her house, she dies. Sue
comes for the funeral, and after it is over, tells Jude that she is not
happy in her marriage. Next morning, they are about to go their
separate ways, but embrace before they go. Jude then burns all his
theological books, symbolizing his break with his aspirations for a
religious life. Though Sue returns to her husband, she cannot stand
him and tries to lock herself in a cupboard. Phillotson is very bitter but
keeps quiet until she asks him if he would mind if she lived separately.
They continue to live together, but not as man and wife. The next


                             Thomas Hardy : Jude The Obscure / 91
morning, he tells her that she is free to go, although in doing so, he
ruins himself professionally. Sue and Jude go off together but cannot
legally again. So they start divorce proceedings against Phillotson
and Arabella. Sue has been of a questioner of society while Jude is
more conservative, but from this point on their opinions are reversed,
until Jude becomes a sceptic while Sue becomes orthodox.
  Hardy tells us in Part V that though Sue and Jude are free to marry
they neglect to do so for reasons which are rather obscure and lie in
the character of Sue. One day Arabella returns to England with
Carlett, her tavern-keeper husband and claims that she has a child by
Jude and that he and Sue must accept it and take care of it. Jude is not
sure that the child is his, but accepts it. It is a boy a quiet, withdrawn
and fantastic child named Little Father Time. In the succeeding years
Jude and Sue have two children of their own. Jude's health fails due
to exertion of his trade.
  In Part VI the writer tells us that one day when he and Sue are
absent, Little Father Time murders the two younger children and then
kills himself. Sue feels that she is guilty and the deaths are
punishments for her sins. She asks Phillotson to marry her again so
that she can be punished. And she advises Jude to marry Arabella
who's second husband is now dead. As the novel concludes, Jude is
married again to Arabella. He dies in Christminster on the
anniversary of the death of his children. Meanwhile, Sue continues to
be married to Phillotson though she has loved Jude to the end. The
marriage is a loveless one and has been entered into by her out of a
religious fanaticism and a wish for punishment.

                        6.1 Introduction
   Hardy wrote his novels in the later part of the 19th century. Jude
the Obscure was written towards the end of his literary career. As in
most of his novels, the background of the novel is rural England. His
knowledge of country life made the details vivid and the characters
realistic. Hardy's preoccupation with Fate ruling over men's lives is
apparent in this novel also because the characters watch helplessly as
they move towards inevitable tragedy.




                             Thomas Hardy : Jude The Obscure / 93
 6.2 Analysis of the characters in Jude The Obscure
   Hardy has created Jude, the protagonist, as a tragic character. He
is a man of humble origins but becomes an outsider in society. There
is an obscure curse on the Fawley family and that is that they are not
made for happy marriages. From his childhood, Jude has high
aspirations. He wishes to leave the village and pursue learning at the
university. At first, all he wants is a non-religious end, but gradually he
abandons this and decides to become a clergyman, an aim which is
also given up. At heart, Jude is a very sentimental man and cannot
bear to hurt any living creature, be it an insect or a dumb animal like
a pig or a rabbit. He feels the same sense of compassion for Arabella
and Sue, neither of whom he wants to hurt. Unfortunately he does not
conform to the social norms and invites criticism amounting to
condemnation. Jude proceeds from faith and conservatism to
skepticism. In showing Jude undergoing great suffering (as when his
children are murdered), and dying an early death, Hardy has
undoubtedly made use of melodrama to win the reader's sympathy,
but .he has also shown him as the modern hero rebelling against
society and alienated from it.
  Arabella, Jude's first wife, is described in animalistic terms, as the
"pig-woman", and seen to be tending to pigs and preparing pork for
the market. She is a schemer and entraps Jude into marriage, but her
motives are relatively uncomplicated. She wants to marry Jude so that
she can escape from an unsatisfactory life as a pig-keeper's daughter,
and she is absolutely unscrupulous in the way she goes about
trapping Jude. She deserts Jude and contracts a bigamous marriage
with little remorse and does not hesitate to make Jude accept Little
Father Time. At the end of the novel, she is the same selfish, unfeeling
person she was at the beginning, and this is seen in the way she tries
to be friendly with the physician Vilbert when Jude is going to die so
that she may have a protector and a means of support.
  Sue is the most complex character in the novel and also the most
difficult to understand. She is a classic case of sexual hysteria, which
she is unable to admit to herself, and which she converts into rigid self-
punishment. Hardy, with great sympathy, has created convincingly the
weaknesses in her personality. She alternately attracts and repulses
both her lovers, and her sadism is directed towards both of them. She


                English Fiction / 94
is, as Jude realizes, unfit for normal marriage, and therefore, could not
have married Phillotson or anyone else. Hardy underlines the physical
repulsion she feels for Phillotson. Hardy uses the melodramatic
episode of the death of the children to show Sue's breakdown into
hysteria. He shows her frantic struggle at the graveside, and it is the
picture of a personality precariously balanced on the edge of insanity.
In her shrinking from the physical, she contrasts with Arabella, who
uses the physical for whatever satisfaction and material comfort it will
bring her. As the novel proceeds, her feelings remain the same,
though grotesquely exaggerated, and she finally deals with her
emotional problems by self-punishment.
    When Jude is a small boy, Phillotson the schoolmaster, fires Jude
with ambition to win a place in the university. Phillotson himself would
be perhaps twenty years or more, older than Jude. and when he
appears after the initial scenes in Marygreen it is as a middle-aged,
rather, resigned man who acts even older than his looks. We never get
a really good physical picture of him, or indeed of any character in the
novel except Arabella, because of the tendency for Hardy to create
two-dimensional characters who are symbols of ideas in this novel,
perhaps more than in any other work of his. Phillotson, at any rate,
suffers for his attempt to do the right thing by Sue when she wishes to
leave him, and his character, too, is stunted, so that at the end there
is a hint of sadism in his relation to his wife. He gives the impression
of dryness, lack of vitality, deficiency in emotion, and a certain rawness
of personality which makes him one whom no woman can stand. Yet
he would be described as an upright and honourable person, who, in
the terms of his society, falls from grace once, when he gives Sue her
freedom to go to Jude. And this is the most uncharacteristic action of
his life.
    In contrast to the four major characters, most of the other
characters, especially Mrs. Edlin, Giilingham, and aunt Drusilla, serve
as a sort of Greek Chorus - commenting, foretelling, moralizing. No
character is casual and without a function in the book; Hardy shows
the actions of even the most minor of the characters as they
irrevocably affect the lives of the major characters.

            6.3 Jude The Obscure as a depiction
                    of shattered ideals
  In Jude The Obscure Hardy describes the shattered ideals of the
two chief characters as their instincts are forced by society into moulds
that do not fit them. Hardy's attitude to Jude swings between
sympathy, mockery and bitterness at Jude's victimisation. The
narrator's reference to Christ in the early stages of the novel suggests
the spiritual nature of the young Jude but in the middle of this Jude is
awakened to the reality of physical needs when he meets Arabella.
Arabella's association with animals foreshadows her later seduction of
Jude. Jude's first entry in to Christminster looking for work as a
stonemason is not heroic. He is an impractical dreamer who has not
even found out how to apply for admission to a college. He self-
consciously regards himself as a symbol of the intellectual and social
restlessness of the time. Sue occupies part of the pattern of contrasts
in the novel. Arabella represents the temptation of the flesh, while Sue
stands for sensitivity and intellect. Hardy's attitude to Sue is
ambiguous. Jude's first glimpse of her, like his first view of
Christminster is deeply ironic. Sue possesses a deeply contradictory
personality. She fears marriage as a degrading form of social
prostitution but is very narcissistic and insecure. She displays her
intense jealousy of Arabella's place in Jude's life and her
vindictiveness is seen when she revenges herself on Jude and at the
same time torments herself. Her physical aversion to her husband
results in her elopement with Jude.

      6.4 Hardy's use of chance, coincidence and
              fate in Jude The Obscure
    As a novelist, Hardy gave his work a design that was very artistic,
using each circumstance in the narrative for a total effect. The final
effect was one of ruthless Fate functioning in men's lives, corrupting
their chances of happiness, and taking them towards tragedy. This
point of view was almost like a philosophy, and was a very persistent
one. And in the novel it is backed by bringing in chance and
coincidence several times in the story. Eg., Philloston is Jude's former
teacher, and also the man Sue later marries. Or when Arabella
appears just when Jude and Sue are living together, and claims that
she has a child by Jude. Another instance of coincidence is when Jude
dies on the death anniversary of his children. Fate plays such an
important role in determining the course of their lives, that the
characters do not find much consolation in their faith. Eg. Sue is
fanatically orthodox but finds little solace in her faith.

            6.5 Pessimism in Jude The Obscure
    Jude the Obscure is known to be the most serious of Hardy's
novels. The tone of pessimism runs through the novel from the very
beginning to the end. Not only do Jude's childhood and youth show



                              Thomas Hardy : Jude The Obscure / 97
that he is an unfortunate child, but his aspirations to gain entrance in
a college in Christminster appear to be beyond his reach. He is
warned by his Aunt Druscilla that that there was something in the
Fawleyfamily line which makes their marriages unhappy. Soon after
his marriage to Arabella, Jude realizes that he has made a terrible
mistake. Unfortunately, he then gets involved with Sue, who is equally
destructive towards him. When he tells her of his marriage to Arabella,
she is so hurt that she marries Phillotson. Hardy makes the story even
sadder when he shows the marriage to be a disastrous one. What is
seen to be even worse is that Jude and Sue do not marry even when
it is possible. But the episode that reflects the pessimistic attitude of
the writer at its greatest is the one in which innocent children are
murdered by Little Father Time. Predictably, the novel ends with the
death of the protagonist, which is a fitting one for this pessimistic tale.


                           6.6 Conclusion
  Hardy's novels are usually tragic in tone, but there is a note of pity
in them which extends from men and women to all living creatures.
This is what helps to give his characters noble and tragic proportions.
The same is achieved by Joseph Conrad in his Lord Jim , the next
novel we have to study. But Conrad's technique as well as his devices,
as we shall see, are quite different from those of Hardy.


                            6.7 Summary
  In this chapter, we studied some aspects of Jude the Obscure . After
reading a little about the life and works of Hardy, we read a synopsis
of the novel. In the analysis of the characters, we saw how Jude's
wrong decisions give a tragic turn to his life. Arabella is motivated by
animal instincts, while Sue is an example of repressed feelings, and
Phillotson displays a lack of vitality and emotions. All are examples of
shattered ambitions, aspirations and ideals. As in his other novels, in
Jude the Obscure also, Hardy makes use of chance and coincidence
and clearly indicates that he believes that man's life is governed by
fate. The note of pessimism underlying the novel is seen from the
opening to the end of the novel.

         Joseph Conrad : Lord Jim


Introduction to Joseph Conrad, his background and career

    Joseph Conrad was born Teodor Jozef Konrad Korzeniowski in 1857,
the only child of a patriotic Polish couple living in southern Poland. His
father was a poet and a man of letters in Poland and mother was a gentle
well-born lady with a keen mind but frail health. When he was five his
father was arrested because he was suspected of taking part in
revolutionary plots against the Russians and was exiled to northern
Russia. Conrad and his mother went with him. His mother died from the
hardships of prison life three years later when she was only thirty-four.
Conrad's father sent him back to his mother's brother for his education,
and Conrad was never to see him again. The poet patriot lived only four
more years. Conrad was eleven years old, but the emotional bond
between him and his father was so strong that a deep melancholy settled
within the young boy and much of his writing as an adult is marked by
melancholy under currents. Conrad received a good education in Poland
but decided on a different career viz, he chose the sea as his vocation.
Since the age of seventeen, he sailed almost continually, working on ships
that traveled all over the world. This is why most of his novels and short
stories have the sea as a background for the action. In 1886, when he was
twenty-nine, he became a British subject. He published his first novel
Aimaver's Folly in 1895. He published his The Nigger of the Narciccus in
1897, Heart of Darkness in 1899, Lord Jim in 1900, The Secret Agent in
1907, and Under Western Eves in 1911. He was offered Knighthood in
1924 and died soon after.

Summary of Lord Jim
    The reader is introduced to Jim (later Lord Jim) at a time when he
was working as a water clerk for shipping firm in the Far East. It was not
a very good job but Jim was happy and everyone liked him. Jim was born
and raised in an Englishman's home and when he was still a young boy,


                                 Joseph Conrad : Lord Jim / 101
he decided to make the sea his career. He enrolled on a training ship for
officers of the merchant marine. He did well and while still aboard the
training ship, met his first test of courage when he was called to assist a
vessel injured in a fierce storm. Afterwards he justified himself by saying
that he was not really afraid but only waiting for a challenge that would
be equal to his heroism. He then began to work as first mate on the ship
Patna. This was an old steamer bound for holy places with eight hundred
Muslim pilgrims. On a calm dark night in the Arabian Sea, the Patna ran
over some floating wreckage and got badly damaged. Water entered the
bulkhead where hundreds of the pilgrims were asleep. Jim was convinced
that soon the sea water would in and the pilgrims would all be drowned.
As there were few lifeboats and no time, it would not be possible to save
everybody on board. Meanwhile the skipper and other officers struggled
to lower a lifeboat. Jim hated their cowardice and refused to help them.
The officers got the lifeboat over the side and jumped in. Jim also jumped
into the lifeboat. The next few hours were full of horror. The other officers
resented Jim's presence in the lifeboat. They watched as the lights of the
Patna seemed to go out, and Jim imagined that he could hear the screams
of the helpless passengers. The next day a ship picked up the four men and
ten days later it delivered them to an Eastern port. The story which the
Patna skipper invented to excuse their desertion was useless because they
heard the news that a French warship had discovered the Patna deserted
by the officers and towed it into Aden. At this news, the skipper vanished
and the two engineers drank until they were hospitalised. Jim had to face
the official inquiry panel alone. He defended himself and insisted that
there had not been a chance to save the Patna. At the inquiry, a man
named Marlow entered the scene and throughout most of the novel, the
reader sees Jim through Marlow's sympathetic eyes. Deeply interested in
the young good-looking Englishman, Marlow attended the inquiry and
tried to discovery why Jim had deserted the Patna. Jim thinks that
Marlow is calling him a wretched dog and has a low opinion of him. On
the other hand Marlow finds himself drawn to Jim and invites the young
man to have dinner with him at Malabar House. There Jim relates the
story of what happened that night on the Patna, and Marlow realises that
Jim is a tormented soul. The inquiry ends with Jim losing his naval
certificate.
  Marlow finds a job for Jim and the young man does well and pleases
his employer. But suddenly Jim disappears because someone mentions the


               English Fiction / 102
Patna and Jim cannot endure it. In this way Jim leaves job after job until
many people in the Orient know his story. Marlow finally confides his
story to Herr Stein, a philosophical old trader who has a wonderful
butterfly collection. He suggests that Jim should go to Patusan, an
isolated island community in a Malay state where three warring groups
are fighting for supremacy. In Patusan Stein had an unprofitable trading
post under the direction of a cunning Portuguese named Cornelius. Jim
could take over the trading post and begin new life because no one would
know him in Patusan. Stein's offer delighted Jim. He felt that he could
now bury his past completely and no one would ever find out about it.
Stein also gave Jim a silver ring which was a symbol of friendship
between Stein and Doramin, chief of the Malays in Patusan. Alone Jim
traveled to Patusan but was soon captured by Rajah Allang's men.
However, he manages to escape to Doramin's village where he shows him
Stein's silver ring and is warmly welcomed and protected. Doramin's son,
a strong intelligent young man named Dain Waris, and Jim become good
friends walk together to bring Rajah Allang under control.. Jim felt secure
in the love and trust of all the people. He falls in love with a girl named
Jewel who now shares his life. After two years Marlow visits Jim at
Patusan, but he feels that he has intruded into Jim's life and decides never
again to visit Patusan. An Australian named Gentleman Brown and his
band of desperate seamen steal a ship and travel up river to Patusan
intending to plunder their settlement. When the bandits arrive Jim is away
but the villagers drive the invaders away. When Jim returns Doramin,
Dain Waris and all the villagers ask Jim to destroy the robbers but Jim
decides to talk to Brown. Brown does not know Jim's past but he judges
Jim and sees that Jim has a guilty conscience about something. Jim did
not want bloodshed so he promised Brown and his men safe conduct down
the river. Brown, advised and guided by the cunning Cornelius, left as
planned, but treacherously ambushed a group of villagers under Dain
Waris who was killed. Survivors bring the body of Dain Waris to his
father Doramin. On his hand is the silver ring which Jim had sent as a
pledge of Brown's good faith. Meanwhile the terrible news reaches Jim.
His new life has been ruined. The Malays will never trust him again. He
had three choices - he could run, he could fight, or he could give himself
up. But Jim went to Doramin's village, alone and unarmed, he faced
Doramin. Doramin shoots Jim through the chest and he falls at his feet,
a hero in death.

                            7.1 Introduction
  George Eliot's Middlemarch is more a sociological novel though her
approach to characterization is psychological. Conrad's Lord Jim also
displays the writer's psychological approach, but the difference is that
the latter delves deeper into the recesses of his protagonist's mind.
Conrad used the technique of a multi-dimensional view which was
made possible by his narrative technique in which we see Jim through
his own eyes and the eyes of Marlow. This, as we shall see, makes
the novel a very complex one.


   7.2 Conrad's treatment of characters in Lord Jim
  Jim is a tall well-built young man with blue eyes and a deep voice.
On his assignment on the Patna, Jim abandons eight hundred Muslim


                 English Fiction / 104
pilgrims because he thinks that the ship is going to sink. The ship is
rescued and Jim feels terribly ashamed of his cowardly act. He is
unable to live a normal life because he fears that his terrible cowardice
will be revealed and follow him throughout his life. Jim is a very
idealistic person who is ashamed because he cannot live up to his
own idealised image that he has built up. His sense of guilt haunts him
and makes him incapable of achieving anything in life. Conrad has
tried to present Jim as a heroic character who has been
misunderstood but who has become a failure because of his own guilt
complex. Jim is a fine example of the psychological portrait of a man
who could have been a hero but has become a neurotic.
    Marlow is a sea-captain by profession and twenty-years older than
Jim. He has deep sympathy for Jim and tries to help him in every
possible way. Marlow's role in the novel is that of the narrator who
gives shape and order to the story and also who comments and
performs the function of a chorus. He understands Jim's problem
because he belongs to the same profession and also because he is
very sensitive by nature. He tries to help Jim but the flaws in Jim's own
character bring about his tragedy.
   All the other characters in the novel are minor characters like
Jewel, the white girl who loves Jim and tries to protect him as much
as possible; Doramin the native chieftain; Dain Waris the chief's son
and Jim's best friend; Stein the wealthy businessman and collector of
butterflies; Cornelius, Jewel's stepfather who betrays Jim; Brown the
pirate who wants to rob the village; etc.

 7.3 The structure and narrative method in Lord Jim
   When one studies the structure of Lord Jim, one notices that once
Marlow begins to speak, the novel proceeds according to his
information and his ability to present that information. His presentation


                                 Joseph Conrad : Lord Jim / 105
is in three parts. The first is his meeting with Jim and the long interview
on the verandah of Malabar House. The second is his visit to Patusan
many years later. And the third is the long written report which he
sends to a friend. The incidents in between are merely links between
the sequences, and also serve as parallels and contrasts to them.
Thus the reader is presented with a cluster of ideas and incidents
rather than a single, simple action.
  In Lord Jim, there are two voices at work -the voice of the author and
the voice of Marlow. For structural reasons, Conrad chooses to place
an intermediary between the plot and the reader. Marlow is that
intermediary and his arrangement of incidents is the structure of the
novel. The voice of the author (in Chapter I) first tells the reader about
Marlow on a verandah in England. Thereafter, Marlow relates events,
but the voice of the author re-enters story many more times (e.g. in
Chapters IV, VIII, X, XXI, XXXIV, XXXVI). Each time, the author pulls
the reader back to what Marlow is relating on the verandah, from the
place and time of the incident that he is relating.
  The manner in which the events of the tale are related to the reader,
i.e., through the omniscient author or through the first person "I",
indicates that Conrad wanted to combine the advantages of both the
methods. (At the same time, only the former would have been too
diffuse, and only the latter would have been too limited). Brief
narratives are included in earlier ones (eg, Marlowe's narrative
accommodates the narratives of others). This frame-narrative involves
narration within narration, which allows the reader to be at once inside
and outside the narrator, and it is possible for the reader to have a
many-sided point of view and complexity of vision. The shifting
narrative makes possible the vividness of first-hand accounts, and the
presence of Marlowe, dominant throughout the novel, makes for
cohesion.
  The story does not follow the linear method of narration. E.g. in
Chapter XIV, we are taken back to the court of inquiry and its verdict.
This zig-zag narrative method makes heavy demands on the patience
and understanding of the reader. The mystery and glamour of Jim, and
the interest he holds for the reader, are heightened by the narrative
technique, which does not give a consecutive narrative of his
adventures, but only occasional glimpses of his strange career,
separated by long intervals.

             7.4 Prominent themes in Lord Jim
    One of the themes in Lord Jim is the conflict between the
individual's ideals and the harsher aspects of reality. Conrad explores
the idealistic side of human nature in conflict with darker psychic
forces and with an indifferent or hostile society. The novel is also the
story of a quest, or rather two quests. One is Jim's search for
adventure and self-fulfilment, and the other is Marlow's psychological
quest as he struggles towards an understanding of Jim. In one sense,
Jim's quest is also a futile quest for anonymity and respectability as
well as status. It is also the eternal human quest for peace, which is
also a futile one.

     ________________________________________________



                     7.5 Symbolism in Lord Jim
    The major symbol in Lord Jim is light, and by contrast, darkness.
The calm voyage of the Patna in sunlight and moonlight symbolises
the absence of threatening circumstances. But after the collision, the
Patna is swept by rain and darkness, and Jim jumps into the darkness
in a moment of confusion. Marlow always mentions how dark and
savage the jungle is, and to contrast Jim, always dressed in
impeccable white, to the darkness around him. When Stein shows the
delicacy and beauty of the butterfly, he contrasts the perfection of
nature against the imperfections of man.
    Nature becomes an active participant in Lord Jim. Rather than
showing man living in harmony with nature, Conrad shows the


                                Joseph Conrad : Lord Jim / 107
constant struggle in nature which reflects the conflict in man's affairs.
Man's will to survive unmasks every desire for decency and propriety.
The sea becomes a natural ground for treachery and hate when man's
natural fears are touched. The jungle symbolises man's hopeless
struggle to keep afloat in life. Conrad's symbols thus endlessly
suggest new levels of meaning.


                          7.6 Conclusion
  As we have seen, Conrad is a writer who strives for perfection in all
aspects of writing. This is why very often his style, including the
language used,seems to be rather self-conscious and contrived.
Undoubtedly, he depicts the moral dilemma of his characters in vivid
detail. Another novelist, D. H. Lawrence, whose novel we will study in
the next chapter, also shows the inner working of his protagonist's
mind.


                            7.7 Summary
  We have seen in this chapter how Conrad's background and
experience of sea life influenced his writing, as in Lord Jim , which
concerns life of sailors. The synopsis of the novel tells us about Jim's
childhood and youth, when he aspires to be courageous but fails. The
incident of the Patna, when he and the other officers desert the sinking
ship, leave him with a persistent feeling of guilt which haunts him
throughout his life and he is incapable of achieving anything in life. He
finally takes refuge in Patusan, where he finds a good friend in Dain
Waris, a wife in Jewel, and wins the admiration of the natives. But this
is short- lived because he is betrayed by Cornelius and Brown, and
Dain Waris is killed. He knows Doramin will kill him, but goes to him
unarmed, and dies a heroic death. Conrad gives a muti-dimensional
view of    his protagonist, Jim, but merely touches upon other
characters. He gives the reader this insight through his narrative
technique of multiple narrators, including Jim himself, Marlow, letters,
etc. Various themes like Jim's quest for self-fulfilment, Marlow's quest
for an understanding of Jim, man's quest for eternal peace, etc., are
depicted in the novel. Conrad also makes use of various symbols, like
light and darkness, and nature to give depth of meaning to his novel.

                  D. H. Lawrence :
                  Sons and Lovers

Introduction to D. H. Lawrence
     David Herbert Lawrence was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire,
in 1885, to a coal-miner named John Lawrence and his middle class
wife Lydia. The two were incompatible for various reasons, but
particularly because of their cultural disparity. The father was
scarcely able to write his name, and read the newspaper with great
difficulty, while the mother was educated, wrote poetry and had
worked as a teacher. Physical attraction had been the only reason that
they had married each other. When he was sixteen, David left school
to work for a surgical-appliance manufacturer in Nottingham. His
older brother, William, to whom his mother was very attached, fell sick
and died. The mother recovered from this shock only because David
also fell seriously ill, and she nursed him back to health. A close bond
developed between the mother and son, so much so, that as a result of
her possessiveness, he had to terminate his relationship with a young
friend, Jessie. His mother died after a long illness, and he also became
ill with tuberculosis. He decide to take up a teaching post in Germany
with the help of Professor Weekley, but fell in love with his German
wife, Frieda, and later married her. Though he had been writing
stories and articles earlier, his first important work was The
Tresspasser published in 1912. Later, he published Sons and Lovers
(1913), TheRainbow (1915), Twilight in Italy (1916), Women in Love
and The Lost Girl (1920), The Plumed Serpent (1925) and Lady
Chatterley's Lover (1928). He died in 1930.


Summary of Sons and Lovers
   The first few pages of the novel introduce us to the setting of the
novel, which is the mining village of Bestwood . The mother, Gertrude


                             D. H. Lawrence : Sons & Lovers / 111
Morel, is expecting her third child, which they cannot afford. Walter,
her husband, is a miner, and as usual, comes home drunk. She comes
from an educated family and married him because she was attracted
to him because he was virile and a good dancer. He ostensibly is a
hard-working homeowner, but in reality, does not own any house and
is in debt. She soon realizes that he will never grow mentally or
emotionally, and never fails to remind him that he is a failure. An
example of their discord is the episode when Walter cuts off William's
curly locks, for which she makes him feel terrible. Another such
episode is when Walter thrusts her out of the house because she
objects to his drinking with Jerry. Lawrence describes vividly how she
communes with nature and the floral imagery is extremely effective.
Walter tries to show his contrition for her by doing little jobs for her.
Soon she gives birth to a son whom she names Paul, and with whom
she forms a special relationship. Mrs. Morel always takes the children
on her side in the war with Morel, and though his behavior is
deplorable, her tactics are inexcusable. Morel falls ill and is confined
to bed. There is peace in the house and about a year and a half after
Paul's birth, a son is born and is named Arthur, who becomes Morel's
favourite. When Morel tries to discipline his children, but Mrs. Morel
stops him from striking William, and he loses all authority in his
house. As William gets a good job, he moves to the centre of the stage.
The only time Morel establishes some rapport with the family is when
he has a job to do about the house. Then Paul gets an attack of
bronchitis, and though the father also ministers to him, Paul wants his
mother near him all the time. They all look forward to William's
homecoming at Christmas. In the meanwhile, Paul settles down in his
place of work, and once, enjoys an outing with his mother. William
returns home with his girl, Lily, and the mother does not approve of
her. He returns with her again at Whitsuntide, and they play about
with Paul and others in the countryside. Paul likes her, but Mrs. Morel
is disgusted and as a result William is in a confused state of mind. He
returns to London and falls ill. Mrs. Morel goes to nurse him, but he
becomes delirious and dies. She is distraught over his death but
survives because Paul falls seriously ill and has to be nursed back to
health. The bond between them becomes stronger than ever, which
may create problems for him later.
  In Part II of the book Paul takes up his friendship with the Leivers


               English Fiction / 112
family, particularly with Miriam, who is their pretty sixteen- year old
daughter. As Paul and Miriam pursue their common interests in nature
and books, Mrs. Morel begins subtly and indirectly, to reject Miriam.
When Paul is twenty, the family decides to spend a holiday by the sea
at Mablethorpe. Taking Miriam and other friends with him, Paul joins
his family in the outing with a great spirit of adventure. During the
holiday, Mrs. Morel's resentment towards Miriam increases, and Paul
is irritated because she is unresponsive to his amorous advances. One
day, Paul meets Miriam in the company of Clara Dawes, of whom he
approves wholeheartedly. Miriam realizes that his bond with his
mother is such a strong one that it pulls him away. She decides that he
has higher and lower desires, and that, if through Clara, she can burn
away the lower ones, she might have him for herself. Paul's bond with
his mother is becoming stronger but also a little bizarre, as is seen
when he takes her on a holiday to Lincoln. Paul tells her about Clara
and she is glad that Clara is available to Paul because Clara, she
feels, will take his body but leave his soul to her. Paul sends a letter to
Miriam telling her of his decision not to continue with her any longer.
He then begins to see more of Clara and his passion for her increases.
He begins to visit her at her house, and soon becomes her lover. At
home, he announces his break with Miriam, and his mother, sensing
his anguish, consoles him with a few words of approval. Clara's
rejected husband, Baxter Dawes, comes to know about them and one
day, insults Paul in the bar until he throws a glass of beer in Baxter's
face. His feelings for Baxter vary between pity and hate, probably
because he is a father-figure to him. Though Paul lives with Clara for
some time, he feels that love stifles him, crushes his creativity, and
decides to break off. Paul's mother is taken ill and the family realizes
that her illness has no cure, and that she has to be dosed with morphia
to reduce the pain. When her condition worsens, one day Paul and
Annie give her an overdose of morphia and she dies. After his mother's
death, life seems to be a void for him and everything has an air of
unreality. He meets Miriam but their relationship does not improve,
and they decide to part. Paul travels to the country and gazes at the
night sky. He thinks again of his mother but does not give in to his
emotions. He strides quickly towards the lights of the city, towards life
and hope.

                            8.1 Introduction
 While studying the novel by Joseph Conrad in the previous chapter,
we observed that though Conrad depicted man in the context of
society, his focus was more on the internal conflict within the man
rather than the external one. D.H.Lawrence, in his Sons and Lovers,
does show the conflict within the protagonist's mind, but gives equal
importance to interpersonal relationships. Eg., the mother-son, the
father-son, the husband-wife as well as the man-woman relationship.
Unlike Conrad, he does not make use of the multiple-narrator method,
but we see the events from the point of view of the protagonist.




                 English Fiction / 114
    8.2 Analysis of Characters in Sons and Lovers
   Paul's character is moulded right from the time his mother was
pregnant with him. So, in the very first chapter of the novel, Walter has
an argument with his wife and pushes her out into the garden.
Gertrude, pregnant with Paul, walks in the garden and feels the
presence of the life force in nature because she is intensely conscious
of the stars, the moonlight, the flowers and above all, the heady
perfume of the flowers. She is also very conscious of the child within
her body and we realize that this child is going to be a very special one
for her. When Paul is a child, he gets an attack of bronchitis, and has
to stay at home to recover. At that time, she has set her hopes on
William, but is also very attached to Paul, while he lies on the couch
observing and admiring her. Paul is a very shy child, and hates doing
jobs like collecting money for his father or scanning advertisements in
the papers for a position suitable. He enjoys the company of his
mother the most, as when they spend a day out in the city or in the
countryside. He loves spending money to buy little gifts for her and
brings home the prizes he wins to her as well as the money he earns
at his job. After William's death, it is Paul's illness which saves her
from calamity. Paul's association with Miriam is, at first, a charming
boy-girl friendship which is spoiled by the mother's possessiveness.
Paul realizes what is happening, but is helpless before his mother's
blackmailing techniques as well as his own inability to break free from
her. Both Miriam and his mother feel that an affair with Clara will do
him good from their own point of view, but after it is over, Paul knows
that he cannot have a normal relationship with any woman as long as
his mother is alive. Though Paul resents his father (a classic example
of the Oedipus complex), he admires his strength and virility, and this
attitude is reflected in his love-hate relationship with Baxter. Paul's
unnatural relationship with his mother is clearly seen when he advises
her to detach herself from his father. When the mother dies after the
overdose of morphia given by Paul, one would expect him to walk
towards self-destruction, as he does at first. With his anchor, his
mother gone, he is a broken spirit, restless and directionless. But
Lawrence shows that a tenuous link holds him to sanity and he makes
a superhuman effort to move away from death and towards life.




                              D. H. Lawrence : Sons & Lovers / 115
   Mrs. Morel comes from a middle class background, and hence has
rigid morals and values which she realizes Walter does not have, but
wants her children to follow. She loves discussions, loves to listen to
intellectual talk, neither of which she can get after her marriage to
Walter. Her life is drab, lacking promise of personal and social
fulfillment. Above all, she feels betrayed and disillusioned by her
husband, who has fallen down on his early matrimonial promises
because he has neither the social respectability nor the monetary
security she wanted. In her disappointment, she turns first to William,
and after his death, to Paul, for fulfillment. She places all her feelings
and hopes in her sons, casting off her husband altogether. Her outlook
and character are set at the very beginning of the novel, and nothing
can stop her but death.
  Miriam, is the first woman with whom Paul tries to establish a
relationship, with whom he has a lot in common. He derives stimulus,
inspiration from her, but dislikes her overemotional intensity and
sacrificial spirituality.. She is timid and apprehensive (eg. of feeding
hens, of riding the swing), which hints at her sexual incapacity. On the
other hand, with Clara, Paul finds fulfillment of physical passion, of
the life force of the universe. Though he finds joy and an elemental
vitality, his relationship with Clara is sketchy outside their physical
passion. Perhaps this is why both Mrs. Morel as well as Miriam feel
that Clara is harmless. In fact, Mrs. Morel is afraid of Miriam because
Paul enjoys special rapport with her. Though Paul at first thinks there
is something lacking in the women, he later realizes that the
insufficiency lies him and not in anyone else. This is why he is glad
when she goes back to Baxter Dawes.
  Both Walter Morel and Baxter Dawes are very earthy, physical men.
Lawrence draws Walter, in particular, very vividly. Along with his deceit
before marriage, drunkenness, savagery, self-pity, insensitivity he
wins sympathy through his sheer vitality as well as his delegation to
the most unimportant position in the household by the family. Baxter is
the father-figure, a paler version of Walter.

     Clara                 possessive


          8.3 The structure of Sons and Lovers -
                Is it two separate novels?
    The novel is made up of two parts, each of which is made up of
several chapters. The novel is the story of the protagonist from birth
through childhood to youth. Part I of the novel is often regarded as the
more vivid and appealing one, while Part II is more drawn-out and less
interesting. Many critics often say that these various units, the
chapters or the two parts, are not really connected. But the counter-
argument is that the interconnection between the actions arising out of
the characters binds them together. The novel begins with the early
married life of the Morels to the last scene when Paul turns from death
and walks towards lights and life. The novel has several turning points,
eg., when Mrs. Morel rejects her husband and turns to her children, or
when William dies, etc. Though such turning points occur again and
again in the novel, the mother's obsessive love for Paul cements them
together. Thus, the harsh setting, the parental disagreements, the
rejection of the father, Paul's efforts to transfer his love for his mother
first to Miriam and then to Clara, his rejection of the two and
submission to his mother, all are carried forward by their own
momentum to the conclusion. The various chapters and the two parts
are joined into one whole, and do not appear to be disconnected and
the novel is not lacking in form.

          8.5 Sons and Lovers as a reflection of
                    industrial society
  Sons and Lovers is set in the mining village of Bestwood, near
Nottingham.
 This is the place where the colliers working in the coal fields of
Nottinghamshire live. The houses are ugly and the ash-pits full of
squalor. But the countryside was still unaffected by the Industrial
Revolution, and the woodlands, cornfields, brooks and old farms were
the same as before. The families living here had their lives centered
around their home , school, chapel and the pub. Paul was deeply
influenced by the natural beauty of the countryside around, especially
Willey Farm, and a trip there, was a great treat for the family. Except
for a few episodes, which take place in London or the sea resort, the
major part of the novel has this as the background. The novel reflects
the life of the working class in England during the early part of the
twentieth century. Walter Morel represents the proletariat, being
rough, earthy, and knowing a world which consists only of the mines



               English Fiction / 118
and the pub. Mrs. Morel represents the narrow evangelicalism of the
middle class of this period which aspired for respectability and a better
life.


                         8.6 Conclusion
   D. H. Lawrence depicts his characters in the context of their social
background, and uses the study of the subconscious to penetrate
beneath the surface reactions in life. He thus studies the inner aspects
of the human personality. In the next chapter, we are going to study a
novel by E. M. Forster, who also studies human nature in the context
of society, but also regards the cultural background as an important
factor that influences it. D. H. Lawrence does not consider the political
or cultural angle at all. His concentration is on the individual in the
context of his familial and social background.


                          8.7 Summary
    The novel opens with a description of life in the mining community
where the Morel family lives. Paul is born and grows up in an
atmosphere of animosity between his parents. The mother tries to find
satisfaction by concentrating her attention on her sons. William, the
elder one dies and she turns to Paul. As he grows up, he tries to
establish a relationship with two women but his mother's hold over him
is so strong that he finds himself incapable of doing so. When she
dies, he is a broken man, and it is only tremendous effort that he pulls
himself away from death and decides to start a new life again. An
analysis of the characters enables us to understand better the
influence of the mother on the lives of her sons, and that it is Paul's
fault and not Miriam's or Clara's that he cannot have a normal
relationship with them. It is this factor of the mother's domination and
Paul's struggle to maintain his independence that bind the novel's
structure into one whole. The autobiographical element is very strong
because Lawrence has incorporated many incidents from his own life
in the novel.

  E. M. Forster : A Passage to India


Introduction to E. M. Forster


     E. M. Forster was born in 1879 and died in 1970, his life spanning
almost an entire century. His father died when he was an infant, and
his mother moved with him to Hertfordshire, where he spent some
unforgettable days of his childhood. He studied at Tonbridge public
school from 1893 to 1897. He went on to study at Cambridge where
he made good friends like John Maynard Keynes, Leonard Woolf,
Lytton Strachey, Desmond MacCarthy, Roger Fry, Alfred Whitehead
and Bertrand Russell. After graduating in 1901, he spent two years
travelling in Italy and Greece. He inherited a legacy from his great
aunt for which he was forever grateful because it enabled him to lead
a life of private means and become a writer.
    He published four novels in the first decade of the 20th century,
Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905), The Longest Journey (1907), A
Room with a View (1908), and Howard's End (1910). He visited India
in 1912-13, and again in 1921-22. He began his first draft of A
Passage to India after his first visit and finally completed and
published it in 1924. He continued to publish a wide variety of books
including a critical work, Aspects of the Novel (1927). He died in
1970.


Summary of A Passage to India


   The novel is set during the British rule in India. Chandrapore is a
town situated on the banks of the River Ganges in north-eastern India.
The famous Marabar caves are twenty miles away from this town.


                            E. M. Forster : A Passage to India / 123
Adela Quested accompanies Mrs. Moore on a visit to Chandrapore to
see her son, the new City Magistrate, Ronny Heaslop. Adela and
Ronny have met in England and their engagement is now to be
confirmed. Adela's wish is to see the real India. Mrs. Moore meets a
young Moslem, Dr. Aziz, by chance, on an evening walk by herself.
Aziz has been at a social evening with friends which was disrupted by
imperious summons from his superior, Major Callender, to the City
Hospital, and has also been snubbed by his wife, Mrs. Callender. A
friendship develops between him and Mrs. Moore because he sees that
she respects his religion. The Collector, Mr. Turton, arranges a Bridge
Party at the club for Adela, where the English visitors can meet some
local Indians, but this is not a success. The women meet Cyril
Fielding, the Principal of the Government College. He likes their
liberal attitude and invites them for tea at the college along with the
Hindu Brahmin, Professor Godbole, and Dr. Aziz. He and Aziz had
both wanted to meet each other. Aziz invites the ladies on an
expedition to the Marabar Hills and the famous caves. When Ronnie
arrives, he is displeased by the informality and they all feel
uncomfortable. Adela feels that Anglo-Indian life has changed Ronnie
and now she does not want to marry him, but a car accident brings
them together and they are engaged. Fielding and Aziz become good
friends. The expedition to the caves does not begin well as Fielding
and Godbole miss the train. Mrs. Moore suffers from claustrophobia
and feels ill when she enters the first cave. She is also overcome by a
strange feeling caused by the cave's empty echo. Adela and Aziz go
into the caves with a guide. They become separated and enter different
caves. The guide misses Adela and Aziz sees her next at the foot of the
hills talking to an English woman, Miss Derek, with whom she leaves.
On their return to Chandrapore, Aziz is arrested for molesting Adela
in a cave. An attitude of hostility develops between the British and
Indian communities. Fielding believes that Aziz has been falsely
accused and resigns from the club. Adela complains of a strange echo
in her head and has a nervous breakdown. Mrs. Moore believes Aziz
to be innocent, but leaves for home, and dies at sea on the very day of
the trial. Adela suddenly declares Aziz to be innocent and the trial
breaks up in disorder.
  Adela is disowned by the Anglo-Indian community and is protected
by Fielding much to the displeasure of Aziz and his friends. Ronnie


              English Fiction / 124
breaks off the engagement and Adela leaves for home. Aziz suspects
that Fielding plans to marry Adela himself and is deliberately absent
when Fielding departs on leave for England. Two years later, in Mau,
in central India, Godbole is the Minister of Education, and, through
his influence, Aziz is mow the personal physician of the Maharajah. It
is the time of the Gokul Ashtami festival, to celebrate the birth of
Krishna, and during the festivities, Fielding remembers Mrs. Moore's
trance like state. Aziz learns of Fielding's arrival on an official visit as
an Education Inspector with his wife and brother, but does not want to
meet him because he thinks that Fielding has married Adela. But when
he meets him, he realizes that Fielding has married Stella, Mrs.
Moore's daughter by her second marriage and Ronnie's half-sister.
Later, he meets Ralph Moore, and is strangely drawn to him just as he
was to his mother. They go to the Mau tank to see the Gokul Ashtami
procession. Their boat collides with Fielding's boat as he has come
with Stella, and they all fall into the water. Though this accident helps
to bridge the gap between them, they realize that they cannot be true
friends while political inequality exists between their two nations.

  Friends, a study of this chapter will enable you to :-
  a)      Analyse the characters in the novel
  b)      Study the setting of the novel
  c)      Study the themes in the novel
  d)      Study the symbols in the novel


                          9.1 Introduction
 While studying the novel by D. H. Lawrence in the previous chapter,
we noted the way in which Lawrence not only portrays the character
of the protagonist with reference to his social and familial background,
but also emphasizes on the life force within the individual. E. M.
Forster's A Passage to India was published in 1924, more than a
decade after D. H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers , which was published
in 1913. This is why we are studying it after Lawrence's novel, though
he was born after Forster. Forster presented an admirable picture of
India during the British rule, and while doing so, showed not only the
romance of the east, but the difficulty the Indians and the Anglo-
Indians had in mutual understanding.


       9.2 Characterisation in A Passage to India
  Adela is the most important woman character in the novel.           A
thoughtful and brave girl, Adela has come to marry Mrs. Moore's son,

               English Fiction / 126
and to decide if she can live in India. She represents the intellectual
emancipation of the middle class Edwardians. When she visits the
caves with Aziz, in a haze of fatigue, she notices the nicks in the rocks
which lead her to the frightening discovery that she and Ronnie do not
love each other. She has a bad habit of questioning, and asks Aziz if
he has more than one wife, and this shocks the young man very much.
Adela is tested before the challenge of the Marabar Hills, and is not
seen in a very good light. She has been affected by the echo in the
cave and cannot explain what made her behave in an inexplicable
manner. Mrs. Moore neither sympathizes with her nor helps her. At the
time of the trial, she is nervous and still sick. The writer tells us through
Mr. Turton that it is women like these that make things difficult for the
British and fracture their relations with the local people. When the
people chant Mrs. Moore's name, her memory invades the courtroom
and steadies Adela. We are taken inside her mind again as she moves
towards mental crisis and nervous breakdown. She is back in the
Marabar Hills and everything is astonishingly clear. Fielding is the only
one to realize that she was going to have a nervous breakdown and
that his friend was saved. The charge is withdrawn & the court breaks
up in clamour and confusion. She goes with Fielding to his garden
house & he discusses what really happened in the cave but she loses
interest. Ronnie breaks off the engagement & Adela goes back home.
    Mrs. Moore, the next prominent woman character in the novel, has
brief appearances in the novel , and is dismissed before the trial. But
her influence in the novel is felt long after she has left the scene.
Though she is vulnerable to the negative echo of the Marabar caves,
her spirit lives on as a healing presence in the novel (in the third
section of the novel).
    Aziz is central to the story. He is a poet and by profession a
surgeon. When he is snubbed by two Englishwomen at the Civil
Surgeon's bungalow, it is the first glimpse of the conflict which makes
the story. He walks home and on the way he turns into a small mosque
to seek peace. There he meets Mrs. Moore, the old English lady who
has fled from the English club to the peace of the mosque. They
develop a liking for each other and he escorts her back to the club
where he meets the other Englishwoman, Adela. The Civil Surgeon
respects his professional competence. He has the Muslim warmth and
sentiment as well as the Muslim mercurial nature and hauteur. He has


                               E. M. Forster : A Passage to India / 127
the eagerness and prickliness of Muslim youth as well as the poise of
the professional man. When Aziz and Fielding become friends, they
exchange confidences and Aziz shows him a photograph of his dead
wife, as if admitting him as a brother within the purdah. In the second
part, when the visit to the caves begins, Aziz behaves like a boy and
is nearly in tears when Fielding and Godbole miss the train. He
undergoes a definite change after the Marabar scandal.
  He is a romantic dreamer, but the traumatic trial awakens him and
makes him aware of the colonial reality of British rule. He is
discriminated against by the Anglo-Indian officials, often feels
humiliated by their attitudes toward him, but his desire for friendship
with them makes him take his rulers as a joke. He realizes that he had
been foolish not to see the fact that he would not be respected unless
he has a politically equal status. His primary concern is not political.
The change in him is most apparent in his attitude to poetry. Before the
Marabar scandal, it was about the nostalgia for Islam, but after it, he
is not so easily swayed by his universal idea of Indians as before,
because he realizes the divided the divided and fragmented reality of
Indian society.
  Fielding occupies a Garden House where he and Aziz meet to make
arrangements that will change their lives. He is almost middle aged
and is a good tempered, balanced and intelligent fellow who believes
in education. By coming to India in middle age, he had the advantage
over other Englishmen who came straight after their education without
working in their own civilization. He had difficulty in getting on with his
own countrymen in Chandrapore, partly because the womenfolk
dislike him. This may be because he found them insipid. He is
Forster's ideal image of an Edwardian. Like Adela, Fielding is tested
before the challenge of the Marabar Hills.
  Professor Godbole is often regarded as not really essential to the
plot, but is clearly a very significant character. Like Mrs. Moore, he
does not have a consistent presence, and has brief but significant
appearances in the novel. He is always disappearing at critical times
but his discussion of good and evil is important and puts the events in
the Marabar Caves in their context. His divine trance at the end of the
novel expresses Forster's desire for acceptance & charity. His
philosophy, which is his idea of Hinduism can accept both confusion
and mystery.

          9.3 The Structure of A Passage to India
    Structurally, many critics regard this novel as a masterpiece.
Forster has interwoven the physical and the metaphysical in the
narrative to make a meticulously planned work of art. The novel is
divided into three sections :Mosque, Caves, Temple. They correspond
to three great religions present in India, viz. Islam, Christianity and
Hinduism, and for the qualities of character and temperament
associated with these ethnic groups. Forster himself said that these
also corresponded to the three sections of the Indian year : the cool
spring, the hot summer and the wet monsoon season. The three
sections emphasise certain qualities of mind and soul. To the Muslim
belongs the emotional nature, to the Anglo-Indian the intellect, and to
the Hindu the capacity for love. Viewed from the angle of plot, the
novel has a strong conventional plot. Adela's arrival in India, her desire
to see the real India, the expedition to the Marabar Caves, her
accusation and the result of the trial, have a conventional pattern of a
beginning, a complication and its final unraveling. When the novel is
read in this manner, the interest in the story is lost once the trial is over
and the Temple section appears to be a postscript, written as an
afterthought. But when seen from the point of view mentioned earlier,
the last section is an essential part of the design.
    Forster uses the traditional narrative method of the omniscient
narrator in the novel. Thus, the narrator overviews the action,
comments from any angle and can enter the minds of different people
like Aziz, Ronnie, Adela, or Fielding. The narrator sets the tone for
each section, and shapes and controls the progress of the story and
reflecting the different points of view of the various ethnic sections.

          9.4 Symbolism in A Passage to India
  In many of his novels, Forster has made use of symbols like circles,
hollows, rooms, houses, caves, etc. The caves are a very important
symbol in A Passage to India , and, in fact, at the heart of the novel
literally, structurally, as well as symbolically. The caves are a plot
device because Adela's quest for the real India leads to the Caves,
they bring about the imprisonment and trial of Aziz, Mrs. Moore
decides to go home and dies on the way, Adela's engagement is
broken, and the friendship between Aziz and Fielding is endangered.
The Caves also possess a powerful symbolic force. In a frightening
way, they represent the hostility of the Indian earth to European power
and control. Both the Marabar Hills and Caves defy understanding on
the part of the characters in the novel. For Mrs. Moore, the challenge
of the caves is a spiritual one. She likes mysteries but dislikes what
she calls muddles., and the Marabar Hills and Caves appear to be a
metaphysical muddle on a grand scale. For Adela, the challenge
seems more psychological because they expose her barren emotional
life and the fear of the physical. The Caves temporarily break the
power of reason in her bringing about mental and physical breakdown.

                         9.5 Conclusion
  In the next chapter, we are going to study a novel by Graham
Greene, who also studies human nature in the context of society, but


              English Fiction / 130
also regards the political situation as an important factor that
influences it. E. M. Forster does not consider the political angle at all.
His concentration is on the individual in the context of his social and
cultural background. Greene is a realist, and as we shall see, he
presents character and emotion with a perfect control of narrative.
    A study of the above novels, which are representative texts, gives
an idea of the literary trends during a particular period in English
literature. They also indicate some aspects of the philosophy and style
of that particular writer. Such a study enables the reader to understand
how the novel evolved as a literary form and how it was shaped by the
period in which it was written. Literature grows out of life, and a literary
artist tries to reflect the microcosm (the individual's world), as well as
the macrocosm (the outside world) in his or her art. While doing so,
the artist weaves together the various threads of plot and
characterisation by using a narrative technique that suits him best to
build a structure that will be aesthetically and logically satisfying. While
studying the novels prescribed for study, it is important to analyze
them in the light of these factors. Though a study of the critical works
is useful, a careful reading of the text is essential for a proper
understanding and appreciation of the novel. The critical works
suggested are a preliminary guideline, and the student is expected to
analyze the text and form an independent opinion after reading many
more of them


                            9.6 Summary
    This novel was begun after Forster's first visit to India and was
completed after his second visit to the country. The novel begins with
the visit of two Englishwomen, Mrs. Moore and Adela, to Chandrapore
in north-eastern India. Mrs. Moore meets Dr. Aziz, and as their
friendship develops, he plans a trip to the famous Marabar Caves.
They plan to go in a group, which include two other friends, Fielding
and Godbole, but only Adela, Aziz and a guide enter the cave. They
are separated and Aziz comes out alone in time to see Adela depart
with a lady. Aziz is arrested for molesting Adela in the caves, and has
to face a trial. Mrs. Moore goes back and dies on the voyage. The
Anglo-Indian and Indian communities develop hostile attitudes toward
each other. Adela takes back her accusation against Aziz and decides


                              E. M. Forster : A Passage to India / 131
to go back home. Fielding also goes to England, and Aziz thinks he
will marry Adela. But when Fielding returns, he is married to Stella.
They all go to watch a procession during the celebrations of Gokul
Ashtami, and fall in the water when their boats capsize. Though this
incident bridges the gap between Fielding and Aziz, they realize that
true friendship can never exist between them. Forster's use of
symbols, particularly that of the cave and his careful construction of
the plot make the novel a unique piece of art.

             Graham Greene :
          The Power and the Glory

Introduction to the life and literary career of Graham Greene
     Graham Greene was born in 1904, in a middle-class family in
Hertfordshire. Though he had a secure, uneventful and happy
childhood, his parents were both remote and authoritative. This lack
of communication between them surfaced in the parent-child
relationships in his novels, where they are of considerable thematic
significance lack of understanding lie at the core of all human
relationships in Greene, but are especially prominent in the parent-
child one, which is after all traditionally based on sympathy, trust and
caring. He left behind the security of home and joined school and was
thrust into a strange world of new people, with strange and often
contradictory emotions and actions. His misery increased when after
thirteen he had to board at school during weekdays and was deprived
of the haven at home. All around him the boy saw evil - in this
awareness lie the roots of the novelists obsession with the loss of
awareness, sins and sufferings, corruption, crime and evidence,
childhood traumas and adult depravity. Moments of escape from this
stifling environment became for him a fleeting time of release and of
prayer (towards the end of his life Greene who was born an Anglican
converted to Catholicism).
     By the time Greene reached his adolescence he found reality in
fiction, with its world of pain, and betrayal. His growing unhappiness
and depression made him seek desperate ways of escape, including
suicide. All through his life this inclination towards self-destruction
remained, and propelled him into dangerous situations. In most of his
novels too his protagonists choose some kind of suicidal end for
themselves. He was, tn fact, later, a manic depressive, who displayed
this weakness in his adolescence. His parents realised that he was
close to a nervous breakdown and took him to a psychoanalyst for


                         Graham Greene : The Power & The Glory / 135
treatment. In spite of having adjusted better to life, Greene would find
the essence of human life in the city and was most at home there.
Perhaps this is why most of his novels are urban in setting and
atmosphere. He made many attempts at writing, but achieved success
for the first time with Stamboul Train in 1932. Some of his other novels
were, A Gun for Sale (1936), Brighton Rock (1938), The Confidential
Agent (1939), The Power and the Glory (1940), The Heart of the
Matter (1948), and The End of the Affair (1951). Greene's religious
development is faithfully mirrored in his novels, many of which were
directly Catholic in their themes and characterisation. His later
novels show a gradual secularization. But he remained a Catholic to
the end - he never divorced his wife inspite of their estrangement and
was given a Catholic funeral.


Summary of The Power and the Glory
   In a particular Mexican state the Church outlawed and the priests
driven underground by the threat of bring shot. After several months,
word went out from the governor's office that there was still one priest,
who was moving from village to village carrying on the work of the
Church by administering the sacraments and saying masses. A young
lieutenant of police, an ardent revolutionist and an anti-clerical,
persuaded his chief to let him search for the priest who, as the
authorities saw it, was guilty of reason. Two photographs were pasted
up together in the police station. One was the picture of an American
bank robber who had killed several police officers in Texas; the other
was that of the priest. No one noticed the irony, least of all the young
lieutenant, who was far more interested in arresting the clergyman.
While the officer was receiving permission to make a search for the
priest, the priest was already in the village, having come there in order
to get aboard a boat that would take him to the city of Vera Cruz and
safety. Before the priest could board the boat word came to him that
an Indian woman was dying several miles inland. True to his calling,
the priest mounted a mule and set out to administer the last rites to the
dying woman even though he realised that he might not find another
ship to carry him to safety. There was one other priest in the vicinity,
Father Jose. But Father Jose had been cowardly enough to renounce
the Church, even to the point of taking a wife, a shrewish old woman.
The authorities paid no attention to him at all, for they felt, and rightly

               English Fiction / 136
so, that the priest who has renounced his vows was a detriment and a
shame to the Church. After completing his mission, the priest came
back to the coast, where he spent the night in a banana warehouse.
The English manager on the plantation allowed him to hide there.
     The following day, hoping to find refuge from the police and from
the revolutionary party of Red Shirts, he set out on the back of a mule
for the interior. As he traveled, he thought of his own past and of
himself as a poor example of the priesthood. For the priest was a
whisky priest, a clerk who would do almost anything for a drink of
spirits. In addition, he had in a moment of weakness fathered a child
by a woman in an inland village. Thinking himself a weak man and a
poor priest, he was still determined to carry on the work of the Church
as long as he could, not because he wanted to be a martyr but because
he knew nothing else to do. After twelve hours of travel he reached the
village where his one-time mistress and his child lived. The woman
took him in overnight, and the following morning he said a mass for
the villagers. Before he could escape the police entered the village.
Marcia claimed him as her husband, and his child, a little grown girl
of seven, named him as her father. In that manner, because of his
earlier sins, he escaped. Meanwhile the police had decided on a new
tactic in uncovering the fugitive. As they passed through each village
they took a hostage. When a certain length of time had passed without
the apprehension of the priest, a hostage was shot. In that manner the
lieutenant of police in charge of the hunt hoped to betray their priest.
    After the police had left the village without discovering him, the
priest mounted his mule and went on his way. He travelled northward
in an effort to escape the police and, if possible, to make his way
temporarily into another state. Some hours after leaving the village,
the priest met with a native who fell in with him. Before long the half
breed discovered the priest for whom the police were searching. He
promised that he, a good Catholic, would not betray the secret, but the
priest was afraid that the promised of seven hundred pesos would be
too much of a temptation for the poor man. When they reached a town,
however, it was the priest's own weakness which out him into the
hands of the police. He had to have some liquor, the sale of which was
against the law. He managed to but some illegally, but his possession
of the contraband was discovered by one of revolutionary Red Shirts,
who raised a cry after him. Tracked down by a posse, the priest was


                         Graham Greene : The Power & The Glory / 137
caught and placed in jail. Fortunately, he was not recognised by the
police, but since he had no money he was kept in jail to work out the
fine.
   The lieutenant of police who was searching feverishly for him
unexpectedly did the priest a good turn. Seeing the ragged old man
working about the jail, the lieutenant stopped to talk with him. The
priest claimed to be a vagrant who had no home of his own. The
lieutenant, feeling sorry for the old fellow, released him and gave him
a present of five pesos. Leaving town, the priest started out across the
country to find a place of temporary safety. After travelling for some
time, he met an Indian woman who could speak only a few words of
Spanish. She managed to make him understand that something was
wrong with her child. He went with her and found that her baby had
been shot; his immediate guess was that the American bandit had done
the deed.
  After performing rites over the child the priest continued his flight.
He eventually made his way into the next state, where he was given
sanctuary by a German plant owner. After resting a few days, he
planned to go to a city and present his problems to his bishop. Before
he could leave, however, he was told that the American bandit, a
Catholic, was dying and needed the priest. The priest answered the
call, even though he was sure he was being led into a trap. The bandit
was really dying, but he lay in the state from which the priest had just
escaped. With him was a party of police, waiting for the priest's
appearance in order to arrest him.
  Immediately after the bandit's death, the police closed in and the
priest was captured. Taken back to the capital of the state and tried for
treason, he was found guilty and sentenced to be shot. The lieutenant
of police, who felt sorry for the old priest tried to persuade Father
Jose to hear his last confession. But Father Jose, feared the
authorities and refused. The priest was led out and shot without the
benefit of the Church's grace. Yet the lieutenant of police had not
succeeded in removing the Church's influence; in the evening of the
day on which the priest died, another priest made his was in secret,
into the town where the execution had taken place.

                         10.1 Introduction
    While studying Forster's novel, we saw how he depicted the inner
development of the individual in the context of his social and cultural
background. On the other hand, Greene in his The Power and the
Glory, portrays the individual against the social and political
background that shape his destiny. This is because the setting of this
novel is Mexico, a land in which the political situation was very
unstable. Forster's novel has a touch of mysticism because he tries to
show the differences in the philosophy and ideology of his characters
representing their cultures.

   10.2 Graham Greene's treatment of characters in
              The Power and the Glory
   Greene's characters are vibrant and intense, and do not bear
resemblance to traditional characters of earlier English drama or
fiction. They are not types but archetypes, and are primary or symbolic
characters in essential human condition, like the characters in a
Morality play. This is why the two major characters are nameless. But
what is unusual is that no matter how typed they may seem, they grow
morally and emotionally. The two main characters in the novel are the
priest and the Lieutenant. The priest who is the hero of the novel, is
trapped in a highly dangerous situation. His duty is to serve the
Catholic community in the Mexican state where active priests are
arrested and killed. He tries to stay alive because he wants to continue
his service to God. There is constantly a conflict in his mind about
whether to remain in Mexico or to escape. When he reaches a port
where he can escape in a steamboat, he is called by a sick woman
who wishes to confess her sins. He goes to her and the steamboat
leaves without him. The reader wonders if he is a martyr or a saint,
because he not only has inadequacies and weaknesses ( he is a semi-
alcoholic and has fathered an illegitimate child ), but continuously
upbraids himself for them. At the same time, the more he regards
himself as a failure, the more he shows the virtue of humility. He is
regarded as a criminal in the eyes of the law and a sinner in the eyes
of devout Catholics. He is judged wanting by others, but he himself
does not judge others. He knows his own weaknesses, and has love
and compassion in his heart even for the mestizo who he knows will
betray him. When he dies after being caught by the Lieutenant, he
becomes the martyr he had never dared to aspire to become.
  The Lieutenant is an upholder of law, and not a villain, though he is
a hunter and an opponent of the priest. Perhaps this is because both,
the pursuer and the pursued are representatives of opposing spiritual
worlds. He is a fanatically dedicated and intelligently resourceful
Marxist assisted by soldiers and the police. Both the Catholic priest
and the atheistic Lieutenant are idealists, both work hard for their
ideals, both have sympathy for the villagers, particularly the poor and
children, and both are ideologically opposed. During their meetings,
the Lieutenant begins to feel sympathy and respect for the priest. This


              English Fiction / 140
is why, though it is illegal, he fetches a confessor ( the cowardly Padre
Jose ) and a bottle of brandy for him. So both the priest and the
Lieutenant are anonymous and both have dialectically representative
roles. While the hero is unquestionably the priest, the Lieutenant's
view is also given importance, to balance between the bad hero and
the good villain, to suggest their equal status as fallen men, and to
point their recognition of human qualities in each other.

10.3 Some observations on The Power and the Glory
    The Power and the Glory is one of the most powerful of Greene's
major novels, and the one considered by most critics to be his finest.
The theme of the hunted man establishes an exciting and nightmarish
atmosphere to the novel which is like a thriller. But there is much more
in it than a simple manhunt. Greene has created characters that are
human and symbolic at the same time. The priest and the lieutenant
represent the dualism in the human spirit - godliness as opposed to
godlessness, love as against hatred, spirituality as against
materialism, and concern for the individual as against concern for the
nation. After the lieutenant captures the priest, there is a dialogue
between the two men which lies at the heart of this story of good and
evil. The lieutenant's ambition to catch this man is a disinterested one.
He has no personal enmity towards the priest but sees him as a
symbol of the poor who are corrupted by the church. He is a nihilist
who wants to destroy the church along with memories along with his
own unhappy childhood. Though the lieutenant is the antithesis of the
priest his obsession with the hunt and his dedication to his job (of
eradicating Catholicism) lead him to lead a life that is priest-like, e.g.
He lives in very simple lodgings. The lieutenant's hunt for and



                          Graham Greene : The Power & The Glory / 141
persecution of the priest turned the priest into a martyr in the eyes of
the people. The lieutenant hates the rich and loves poor, but he cannot
understand or tolerate pain.
   On the other hand the priest has endured pain, anxiety and guilt for
years but sees in his suffering the presence of God's love. The priest
is very conscious of his weakness and failure both as a man and as a
priest. An alcoholic, a scandalous priest with an illegitimate child, a
man terrified of pain and death, he has no illusions about himself. In
fact his self-knowledge raises him to the level of a hero. He is
redeemed in our eyes by his keen sense of responsibility for his sins
and for the suffering he has brought upon others. His purgatory is in
Mexico in his years of flight and in his tormented conscience. He
accepts his loss of peace in the belief that the only reason God denies
him rest is so that he could save a soul. After he sees Brigitta, his love
and sense of responsibility for this child overwhelm him. Through her
he finds his salvation. The lieutenant and the priest provide a foil for
each other and one realises that the lieutenant needs the priest to
absorb his hatred. This symbolic relationship between the two
characters is of fundamental importance to the novel.

         10.4 Conflict between good and evil in
               The Power and the Glory
  The problem of conflict between evil and good is prominent in the
novel. Greene believes that in the ultimate analysis it is God's justice
that is predominant over man's idea of justice. The problem of evil and
suffering is at the centre of human tragedy. When good and evil are
engaged in a fight, the fate of this battle depends on the fortitude and
integrity of each of each individual involved in it. In this novel, Greene
shows a situation where cruelty, corruption have full sway, and crime,
lust and unhappiness fill the land. This is a world of sin and suffering.


               English Fiction / 142
The protagonist is a priest who does wrong and who is aware of his
corruption. When he was young, he suffered from the sins of pride,
complacency, weakness for drink, as well as the sin of the flesh. As he
grows older, his sins increase. He is aware of his evil and sin and is
unable to do anything to save himself from damnation. Greene shows
that both Padre Jose and the whisky priest are aware of their
sacrilege. The real battle between the forces of good and evil takes
place in the soul of the priest. In his death, the evil is defeated and the
forces of good transform the priest into a saint.

   10.5 The Power and the Glory as a reflection of
            the socio-political situation
   This novel shows a state where religion has been outlawed. Only
two priests are left to carry on the word of the gospel. One of them (
i.e. Padre Jose ) marries and bids farewell to his vocation, the other is
the whiskey-priest, who indulges in illicit sex, gluttony, pride and
drinking. He also suffers from cowardice and flees the parish, but he
cannot bring himself to leave his faith. He knows that he is sinning but
is incapable of saving himself. The priest is a man hunted by the law
because this is a state where the church has been banished from the
land and the people do not have the freedom to follow their faith. This
is a place where there is religious persecution, a world that is full of
squalor, desolation, wanton cruelty and corruption. Yet the people
have a desperate need for faith, and it is this that may save them from
a sterile civilization and graceless materialism. Thus this is the perfect
locale for the depiction of Greene's story.


                         10.6 Conclusion
Greene's The Power and the Glory uses the technique of the thriller,


                          Graham Greene : The Power & The Glory / 143
that of the hunter and the hunted, having all the ingredients of
betrayal, chase and hunt. But as Greene becomes involved with more
profound themes, he uses a more complex technique with the use of
symbolism and emphasis on subtle psychological aspects.
  A study of the above novels, which are representative texts, gives an
idea of the literary trends during a particular period in English
literature. They also indicate some aspects of the philosophy and style
of that particular writer. Such a study enables the reader to understand
how the novel evolved as a literary form and how it was shaped by the
period in which it was written. Literature grows out of life, and a literary
artist tries to reflect the microcosm (the individual's world), as well as
the macrocosm (the outside world) in his or her art. While doing so,
the artist weaves together the various threads of plot and
characterisation by using a narrative technique that suits him best to
build a structure that will be aesthetically and logically satisfying. While
studying the novels prescribed for study, it is important to analyze
them in the light of these factors. Though a study of the critical works
is useful, a careful reading of the text is essential for a proper
understanding and appreciation of the novel. The critical works
suggested are a preliminary guideline, and the student is expected to
analyze the text and form an independent opinion after reading many
more of them.


                            10.7 Summary
  In The Power and the Glory , Greene shows a situation where the
church has been banished from the country. The protagonist is a priest
gone bad but who is aware of his corruption. Sins of the flesh attract
him and increase as he grows older, and he sleeps with a woman and
begets a child. He loves this child of sin, but his pursuit of his vocation
is his saving grace. He is pursued by the Lieutenant, who is well-
meaning but misled. The priest is finally betrayed by a mestizo he
goes to help. He is arrested, put into prison and executed. Greene
portrays his characters vividly and realistically. The two main
characters in this novel, viz., the priest and the Lieutenant, are
nameless and represent ideologies rather than individuals. Both have
their good points and weaknesses, and they serve as foils to each
other. The novel depicts the conflict between good and evil in the outer


                English Fiction / 144
physical world, as well as the inner world of the human mind as seen
in the case of the priest. When he dies, the evil is defeated and good
triumphs.

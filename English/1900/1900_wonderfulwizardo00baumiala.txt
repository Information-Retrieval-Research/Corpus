INTRODUCTION.
Folk lore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy
youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories
fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal. The winged
fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.
Yet the old-time fairy tale, having served for genera-

her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice
reached her ears; and she still looked at the little g-irl with
wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.
Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from

was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and
he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.

see where the long- grass bowed in waves before the
coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in
the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that
way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that
direction also.

Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.

bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and
sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a

the dry, gray prairies.

While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and
beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of
the queerest people she had ever seen. They were not as big
as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither
were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall
as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age,
although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.
Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly
dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point
a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims
that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men

were blue; the

^hade as their hats, and wore well polished boots with a
deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought,
were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had
beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older:
her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly
white, and she walked rather stiffly.
When these people drew near the house where Dorothy
was standing- in the doorway, they paused and whispered
among themselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the
little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow
and said, in a sweet voice,
"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land
of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having
killed the wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our
people free from bondage."

charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew."
Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed
them on the table. Then she came out again to the
Munchkins and said,

of the cool, clear water,

she set about making ready for the journey to the City of

Emeralds.

Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened
to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed. It
was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although
the blue was somewhat faded with many w^ashings, it was
still a pretty frock.
The girl washed herself carefully,
dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink
sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled
it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over
the top. Then she looked down at her f-eet and noticed
how old and w^orn her shoes were.
"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,"
she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little

along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.
There were several roads near by, but it did not take
her long to find the one paved with yellow brick. Within
a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald
City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow
roadbed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweet

pretty the country was about her. There were neat fences
.at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and
beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and
able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass
a house, and the people came out to look at

color.

Towards evening, when Dorothy was tired with her
long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the
night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest.
On the green lawn before it many men and women were
dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible
and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table

near by was loaded with delicious

fruits and nuts, pies and
and
other
cakes,
many
good things to eat.
The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her
to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was
the horne of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and
his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch.
Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by
the rich Munchkin himself, whose name was Boq. Then
she sat down upon a settle and watched the people

dance.

When Boq saw

her silver shoes he said,

"You must be

a great sorceress."
''Why?" asked the girl.

"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the
wicked witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and
only witches and sorceresses wear white."

chance of a cyclone into a strange land.

Boq led her into the house, where he gave her a

room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were
made of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly
in them till morning, with Toto curled up on
the blue rug beside her.
She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a

wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and
pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way
that greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine
curiosity to all the people, for they had never
seen a dog before.

along the road of yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so
climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat
down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and
and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a
pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.
Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed
thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack

and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn
and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On
the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every
man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above
friends good-bye,

by means of the pole stuck up its back.
While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer,
painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see

one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must
have been mistaken, at first, for none of the scarecrows in
Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head
to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the
fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole

and barked.

"Good

day," said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky

voice.

"Did you speak?" asked the girl, in wonder.
"Certainly," answered the Scarecrow; "how do you
do?"
"I'm pretty well, thank you," replied Dorothy, politely;
"how do you do?"

There were no fences at all by the road side now, and
the land was rough and untilled. Towards evening they
came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and
close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the
branches shut out the daylight; but the travellers did not
stop,

and went on

into the forest.

"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so

She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could

But the girl lived with an

to the wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two
sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.
Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when

"But Toto!" said the girl, anxiously; "what will protect him?"
"We must protect him ourselves, if he is in danger,"
replied the Tin Woodman.
Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible
roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into
the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spining over and over to the edge of the road, and
then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.
But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression
on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road
and lay still.

"They really are," said the Lion; "but that doesn't

So once more the little company set off upon the
journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's
side.
Toto did not approve this new comrade at first, for

how

nearly he had been crushed between the Lion's great jaws; but after a time he became
more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion

Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful

not to hurt any hving creature; and as he walked along he
wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran

down

and over the hinges of his jaw, and
there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a
question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for
his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly
frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to
relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was
also puzzled to know what was wrong.

They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw
before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided
the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a
very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and
looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and
there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The
sides were so steep that none of them could climb down,
and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.

The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face

looked at him in surprise.
But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of
him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion
crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would

also began to cross the tree, and the Lion said to Dorothy,

nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few
more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins,
they were ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle
of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he
was bigf and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had

back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin

In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow

There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed

where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman
were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her.
"There is no hope for me," she said, sadly, '*for Oz will
not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch
of the West; and that I can never do."
Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help
her; so she went to her own room and lay down on the bed
and cried herself to sleep.

The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said,
"Come with me, for Oz has sent for you."
So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted
into the great Throne Room, where he saw, sitting in the
emerald throne, a most lovely lady. She was dressed
gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks
a crown of jewels.
Growing from her shoulders were
wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if
the slightest breath of air reached them.
When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his
straw stuffing would let him, before this beautiful creature,
she looked upon him sweetly, and said,
'T am Oz, the Great and Terrible.
Who are you, and
why do you seek me?"
Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the
great Head Dorothy had told him of, was much astonished;
but he answered her bravely.
"I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw.

But when the Woodman entered the great Throne
Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Oz had
taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly as
big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly
strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head
like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its

and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair
covered every part of it, and a more dreadful looking
monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin
Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have
beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the
Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much
disappointed.

"Why should I do this?" demanded the Beast.
"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my

"If you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it."

Lion, "and that is to go to the land of the Winkles, seek

her silver whistle twice.

Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying
toward her, enough to darken the sky. And the Wicked

walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming and
the Scarecrow had decided what to do.

"Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl
and the dog and the lion," he said to the Woodman,
"and the bees cannot sting them." This the Woodman
did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the
Lion and held Toto in her arms, the straw

to the strangers and destroy them.

The Winkles were

not a brave people, but they had
to do as they were told; so they marched away until they
came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great roar

and sprang toward them, and the poor Winkles were so
frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.
When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch
beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their
work, after which she sat down to think what she should do
next.
She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful
W^itch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her
mind how to act.
There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a

Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second
time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himThe
self, and driven him out of the land of the West.
Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only
once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers
were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her
wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and
her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left
to destroy Dorothy and her friends.
So the Wicked W^itch took the Golden Cap
from her cupboard and placed it upon her head.
Then she stood upon her left foot and

Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to
tremble with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm

belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to run
away from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the
child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them

know of the wonderful
power the Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch
laughed to herself, and thought, "I can still make her my

and the Scarecrow."

Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful
rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen, where
the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep
the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made
up to work as hard as she could; for she was glad the
Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.
With Dorothy hard at w^ork the Witch thought she
would go into the court-yard and harness the Cowardly
Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure, to
make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to

afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.
"If I cannot harness you," said the Witch to the Lion,

speaking through the bars of the gate, "I can starve you.

You

have nothing to eat until you do as I wish."
So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion;
but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked,
"
"Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?
And the Lion would answer,
"No. If you come in this yard I will bite you."
The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch
wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep

had dried up many years before.
Dorothy's Hfe became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to
Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she w^ould cry
bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking
into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was
for his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he
was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was
with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and
that made him unhappy too.
Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have
for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore.
Her Bees and her Crows and her Wolves were lying in
heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of
the Golden Cap; but if should could only get hold of the
Silver Shoes they would give her more power than all the
other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully,to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might
steal them.
But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes
that she never took them off except at night and when she
took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the
dark to dare go in Dorothy's room at night to take the
shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of
the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was bathIndeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever

ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing.

Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how
it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner

"And what became of them?" asked Dorothy, who
had been greatly interested in the story.

to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once
they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and
find out whether he kept his promises or not.
When the

at nine o'clock the next

they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.

Of course each one of them expected to see the
Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were
greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one
at all in the room.
They kept close to the door and closer

more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz

"We

us to go any other way except due South."

They began walking through the country of the china
people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near the cow
suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail,
and even the milk-maid herself, all falling on the china

ground with a great clatter.
Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken
her leg short off, and that the pail was lying in several
small pieces, while the poor milk-maid had a nick in her

elbow.

"There!" cried the milk-maid, angrily; "see what you

had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long;
but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as
slender as a wasp's waist. This gave the Lion a hint of
the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was
easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring

and landed directly upon the monster's back. Then, with
one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he
knocked the spider's head from its body. Jumping down,
he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when
he knew it was quite dead.
The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts
of the forest were waiting for him and said, proudly,
"You need fear your enemy no longer."
Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their
King, and he promised to come back and rule over them
as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas.

Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion

The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy.
There was field upon field of ripening grain, with well-

paved roads running between, and pretty rippling brooks
with strong bridges across them. The fences and houses
and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had
been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and
blue in the country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings
themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby
and good natured, were dressed all in red, which showed
bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.
The Monkeys had set them down near a farm house,
and the four travellers walked up to it and knocked at the
door. It was opened by the farmer's wife, and when
Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them
all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds
